No- restless that i can not reach out, and share parts of the health-care-system, from where i come from in Denmark. Now, i&apos;ve only once experienced this sort of restlessness after watching a movie, and it was Michael Moores &quot;Rodger and me&quot;. YES- Moore does it again. And he fulfills his role, as an rebellious anti-capitalist, pointing out the wrongs and rights in society, that people have simply grown accustom to. PERFECT! He once again gives us his artistic brand consisting of small terrific, or in this case, horrible stories from everyday people who have been neglected by the American health-care system. Michael Let&apos;s you pass trough the homes of MANY families as you engage upon their stories. This time Michael has brought far more people into the interviews, and it gives the hole bundle more juice then FAHRENHEIT. He also, takes his time to show old clips, video/photos of the people hes interviewing, so you feel you get the entire background on some of the folks. BRAVO! Michael himself, is this time a bit more &quot;americaniced&quot; -but only to really point out the benefits of the other countries, does he take the role of the average American joe. PERFECT! Over all. If you read this. I think this movie will make as huge an impact on you, as it did on me. And i think every Michael Moore film, is both educational and should be thought in schools, as well as very important for the entire society to see! That is... if you want to be a part of your society?",

      "reviewBody": "Despite being critically acclaimed, &apos;Anomalisa&apos; seems to have divided audiences. People were left mesmerised and touched by the film, while others were alienated and perplexed by it.\n\nAfter seeing &apos;Anomalisa&apos; for myself, it is not hard to see why it was acclaimed but at the same time it is not hard to see why it hasn&apos;t clicked with some people. Personally think that &apos;Anomalisa&apos; could have been better, and it would from humble opinion would have worked better as a short film, but its many good points are so well executed that it hard to be too hard on it. Because the visuals, music and voice acting were as wonderful as they were, even if I didn&apos;t like the film it would not have gotten less than a 4 or 5.\n\nThe film apparently was originally intended to be a short film, and it does show because some of the film does feel over-stretched with padded scenes that try to disguise thin plotting (while the sex scene was intimate and touching, it was also drawn-out, somewhat too much so).\n\nSome of the first act in particular does fail to maintain momentum, being very draggy and uneventful in places. For example, the scenes intensely detailing Michael leaving the airport, checking into the hotel and going to the room could have either been trimmed or omitted and it would not have harmed the story at all. The ending is one that is open to interpretation, don&apos;t mind these kind of endings but this one felt sudden and abrupt, the ambiguity suggestive of Kaufmann being unsure as how to end the film.\n\nHowever, &apos;Anomalisa&apos; looks absolutely amazing, the stop-motion style having such a beauty and realism to it as well as imaginative in its detail. When it comes to animated films this year, stylistically &apos;Anomalisa&apos; definitely stands out when it comes to uniqueness. The music score is hypnotic and dream-like while also touchingly understated.\n\nWhen it comes to the script there are some very thought-provoking and poetic moments, while the narratively-linear story achieves a fine balance of the distinctively-Kaufmann psychologically surreal (such as Michael reading the letter from an ex-lover and imagining her presence and Michael&apos;s dream, which was wonderfully strange), the painfully sad and the achingly humane. While some have said that they didn&apos;t get a lot out of &apos;Anomalisa&apos;, while not thematically original exactly the film does say a lot profound to me of the repetitiveness of relationships, it&apos;s the inside that counts and of the necessity of believing we and our loved ones are special.\n\nThe characters are neurotic (almost on the same level of the neurose-ridden characters in a Woody Allen film), especially Michael, but there was something about the touching chemistry between Michael and Lisa and their introvertedness (coming from a fairly introverted person myself) that appealed to me even if they were deliberately not the most likable in the world. The voice acting is hard to fault.\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh clearly put her heart and soul into Lisa and David Thewlis is similarly terrific. Meanwhile it was truly mesmerising as to how Tom Noonan voiced all the rest of the characters (essential to the point that the film made about sounding the same, or &apos;same voice&apos;, which would only have worked really with one voice doing them) and still managed to make them distinct from one another, not many people can do that.\n\nOverall, a polarising film that will mesmerise viewers but alienate others. With me, it alienated at first and it would have worked better as a short film as intended originally but mostly found it very rewarding sticking with it. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

This helps in a lot in this movie because he&apos;s the &apos;sex object&apos; who is not getting any, and you don&apos;t mind not seeing him &apos;add another notch to the bedpost.&apos; \n\nSince all of his conquests make him feel bad or doomed for unhappiness, Matt (Hartnett) feels he must take drastic action by not giving in to any sexual urges.  \n\nHe becomes the subject of an intense office pool and some of the girls who had bet on a specific day he would &apos;cave in&apos; make moves on him.  A website is dedicated to him and he is soon referred to as &apos;Vow Boy.&apos;\n\nThe movie has a lot of laughs.  A couple of scenes seem retundant and a couple don&apos;t belong at all, but for the most part this is pleasant enough entertainment.  Josh gets some big laughs, more than anyone else, but his roommate and his boss get some too.  Josh has some good chemistry with Shannyn Sossamon who plays Erica.  7/10.",

I also liked him in Broken Flowers and Lost in Translation but those were more dramatic roles.\n\nI loved the way that Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss played off of each other. I don&apos;t want to say too much or I&apos;ll give away what happens between them through the movie but I thought they did a fantastic job at creating comedic moments. The scenes where Bob horned in on Leo&apos;s family moments and right into their home were incredible. I laughed out loud through the entire movie.

      "reviewBody": "Y&apos;know, it&apos;s kind of sad to see some of the comments bemoaning Eddie Murphy for not swearing enough anymore. It&apos;s almost as if some people equate foul language with humour. If you&apos;re one of those people who thinks a comic sketch is much funnier with swearing in it, then you&apos;ll no doubt not like Eddie in this movie.\n\nOn the whole, I found DDC to be harmless, unpretentious entertainment aimed at kids, naturally, but with sufficient adult-only gags thrown in to keep the parents happy. In short, a formulaic kids movie designed to keep parents from being bored and kids amused.\n\nThe plot is silly, and predictable, but you don&apos;t go to these sorts of films looking for deep and meaningful dialogue or witty social commentary. You just go to be entertained. And DDC does deliver on that score.\n\n Of particular amusement is Steve Zahn, as the rather cliched Star Trek geek who is the only one who can speak to one of kids - in Klingon! He does kind of steal a lot of the scenes in which he&apos;s in. Anjelica Huston is starting to look real old, but still has that menacing screen presence that no doubt helped land her the role of Mrs Harridan (yep, that really is her name) in this picture. I&apos;m thinking she would have made a much better Cruella de Ville than Glen Close&apos;s overacting scenery munching version in 101 Dalmations.\n\nThe only thing I found a little irritating about this movie was the number of times a microphone popped into view at the top of the screen. I must have counted at least five instances. I kind of grew used to this in the 80&apos;s straight-to-video days, but you don&apos;t really expect to see it nowadays, so it was a little annoying.\n\nOther than that, the movie is harmless and fun. And for those that complain about Eddie not swearing enough....this is a KIDS film, you know.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s the original version, released in 1986 and on videotape, and the 2002 Director&apos;s Cut, available on DVD. The latter version is one of my all-time favorite movies. It compares quite favorably with Peter Jackson&apos;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and is a modern classic.\n\nThe theatrical release of 1986, shamefully butchered (chopped up and badly re-edited) by the mindless suits at Warner, and with its original Jerry Goldsmith score replaced by the rather trite Tangerine Dream soundtrack, is the version most people have seen. It was released on videotape as a children&apos;s movie. What it is, and was intended to be, is a fairy tale for adults. In fact, it&apos;s too intense for really young children.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to say that the &apos;86 version deserves any more than the &quot;6&quot; it&apos;s rated at on its IMDb main page. It is a disappointment, primarily because it&apos;s now impossible to watch without think how much better it could be. The feeling and tone of the film were ruined by its treatment.\n\nThe Ridley Scott Director&apos;s Cut, released in 2002, is a completely different movie. If you haven&apos;t seen this version, you haven&apos;t seen the movie. It deserves a score of 9 or 10. \n\nIt doesn&apos;t look like a movie made 20 years ago. Scenes which are vital to the tone of the film and the meaning of the story have been restored. The sumptuous original soundtrack, recorded with a full orchestra, has also been restored, and this adds more to the film than can be put into words. \n\nAbout the performances: A very young Tom Cruise is excellent as the hero. Tim Curry as the Lord of Darkness is awesome; his costume and voice alone are worth the cost of renting or buying the DVD. Mia Sara is absolutely stunning as Lily. She actually plays two different versions of her character, both wonderfully. This was her first role, a risk for Scott on such a big budget film, and she turned in the performance of her career. She&apos;s never been better, or looked more beautiful, than in this movie. The elves and fairies, both good and evil, are incredibly real-looking and believable. The costumes are perfect, and the sets are breathtaking, literally. One of the largest indoor sets ever constructed - a huge fantasy forest - was built for this movie.\n\nIf you haven&apos;t seen this version, rent it. If you have kids, buy it for them; they&apos;ll watch it over and over. My daughter and her friends watch it repeatedly, she&apos;s probably seen it 50 times.",

When this movie came out I was 13 and of course I enjoyed it much more then as opposed to now but having watched it as a child and as an adult I do remember how much I enjoyed the film as a kid. From the harsh grade of a 4.4 average I assume people where comparing this to complex movies with great plots. Kids should not be subjected to nothing but adult theme. So when you grade the movie remember what audience it was desighned for.As a child I would have gave this movie a 7. Would you drive a metro and act as if it should perform like a porsche?",

Gael underplays the role with a gentle humility giving it a somewhat realistic empathetic character that is not seen in most Marvel projects. The remaining characters are a joy as they ramp it up in the Marvel mode, creating a conflicting contrast to that of Jack&apos;s humbleness, until Jack becomes a wolf! The most enjoyable of all was the interaction with Jack and the monster, an absolute delight.\n\nA visual striking and very entertaining unconvoluted Marvel short film that should have been a feature.

Upon meeting Sheeni, he falls in love with her instantly, and will do anything to be with her. This involves creating an alter ego, and becoming an outlaw.\n\nMy only real complaint is that it seemed to me that they put just enough F-words in this to get it rated R. The swearing could have been cut down to make this PG-13, to appeal to a broader audience.\n\nThis is a simple teen comedy, but adults will like it too, it&apos;s very well written with a good plot, good actors that fit their characters, and plenty of laughs.

      "reviewBody": "I was an enormous fan of Roald Dahl&apos;s books when I was kid. I think of him as the Hands Christian Anderson of the 20th century. I didn&apos;t read all of Dahl&apos;s books but I read most of them. I&apos;ve also seen most of the movies based on his books. Out of all the Roald Dahl books I read as child I would say that &apos;Charlie And The Chocolate Factory&apos; is my favorite but &apos;James And The Giant Peach&apos; is my second favorite. \n\nThe reason why I would say these two books are my favorites is because they&apos;re both about children who live miserable lives until a magical experience changes their lives forever and both end up becoming the luckiest kids in the world. For Charlie, his life changes with a tour of Willy Wonka&apos;s Chocolate Factory, but for James it&apos;s with a magical giant peach and group very friendly creatures.\n\nI first remember hearing about this movie back in late 1996 when it was released in America during the Christmas holidays and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I had to wait until the Easter Holidays before this movie arrived in Australia. I certainly loved it. James&apos;s two horrible aunt&apos;s who are nothing except cruel and nasty. Are as horrible in the movie as they are in the book.\n\nI really loved the creatures from the peach which I remember (from the book) James describing them as &quot;The friendliest creatures in the world&quot;. These creatures include Grasshopper, Earthworm, Centipede, Ladybug, Spider and Glowworm. My two favorite character&apos;s are Spider because her French accent made her a very smooth character and Centipede because of his sense of humor. \n\nI also liked the songs. My favorite was &quot;We&apos;re Family&quot; which the creatures use to express how much they love James. I certainly believe these creatures are the best family any child could have. So for anyone who loved Roald Dahl&apos;s books as a child, you must...must see this film!"

The feature also shines in its presentation of family, and how to work things out.\n\nIf you have seen the trailers, and read the reviews you have an idea of what is in it, so I will not dwell on that. One thing I have not seen elsewhere and I recommend is that you stay on your seat when the film appears to be over, there are quite a few extra treats during and after the credits."

      "reviewBody": "A lot of times I go into a movie with an opinion already formed about it. It&apos;s not based on any research or critical reviews, simply on the trailer. That was case with The Incredible Burt Wonderstone. My opinion of the film was not too positive going in. I was dragged to it by a friend of mine with questionable taste in movies to begin with. I could have not been more surprised. I found myself laughing through the entire feature.\n\nThe movie is pretty farcical to say the least, at some junctures borderline silly, but found myself quite enjoying the humor. It was a nice change of pace from all the recent comedies that have to go to the extreme with language and sex humor to make their point. It pokes fun at inter-workings of the illusionist and the final scene before the credits is classic.\n\nThe characters were very well cast. It is no secret based on past films and TV that Steve Carrell has experience in magic tricks, and he pulls it off in the film. It was also refreshing to see Steve Buscemi reprise a comedic role and carry, an impressive contrast to bootlegger Knucky Thompson. And as you would expect, Jim Carrey steals the show as the antagonistic shock magician, Steve Gray. For those who like these actors, The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is a silly, light hearted but enjoyable hour and forty minute movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I was expecting to come away with a sassy name for this new genre, the Hollywood-ensemble rom-com, but there was nothing clever to provide any inspiration in &quot;What to Expect When You&apos;re Expecting&quot;. The best line that I have heard to describe this comes from a fellow IMDb user, gregeichelberger, &quot;It&apos;s &quot;New Year&apos;s Eve&quot; in the neo-natal unit; &quot;Valentine&apos;s Day&quot; with a uterus; &quot;Knocked Up&quot; times five.&quot; That sums up the whole thing perfectly.\n\nThe Hollywood ensemble is this frustrating trend to load the movie with as many stars as possible, so you have only floating heads and no actual characters. Surprisingly, one of the worst offenders is the similarly-themed indie dramedy &quot;Conception&quot; (2010) where we get to follow 9 (yes, 9!) different couples. This movie isn&apos;t as bad, there are only 5 main couples.\n\nThe intertwining of them is very limited. The four other girls basically all watch Jules (Cameron Diaz) on her reality TV shows. The timing, on the other hand, is all in sync. They get pregnant at the same time, start showing at the same time, and give birth at the same time. The point is of course that you don&apos;t know what to expect since each girl&apos;s pregnancy is different and experiences it differently.\n\nJules is going to control it – whether her partner tags along or not; Holly (Jennifer Lopez) is going to lie her way through adoption if that&apos;s what it takes; Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) wants the joy but gets the worst; Skyler (Brooklyn Decker) is going to make it perfect, just like herself; Rosie (Anna Kendrick) doesn&apos;t know what she&apos;s going to do. If the movie had left it at that, it would have been cute, romantic, funny and heartfelt, and possibly empowering.\n\nBut then they introduced &quot;the dude pack&quot; which is even worse than it sounds. They are a group of fathers, led by Chris Rock, who are given the stupidest sounding lines to try and make funny. It was painful how unfunny it was. Imagine if you will, a Hollywood writer being paid to come up with never-before-said lines to turn into popular catch-phrases. The way &quot;Horrible Bosses&quot; was almost successful (but ultimately not) with Sudeikis&apos; &quot;I would like to bend her over a barrel and show her the fifty states&quot;. That was exactly the case with the &quot;comedy&quot; in this movie. All of their lines were met with a few unimpressed question marks on faces but never any laughs.\n\nHowever, the mothers-to-be were pretty good. Some were on the boring side, but two were able to deliver enough humour and heart to almost make up for the entirety of &quot;What to Expect When You&apos;re Expecting&quot;. I don&apos;t know what it is about Anna Kendrick but she makes my heart melt every time she&apos;s on the screen. Extremely cute, in a relatable kind of way, and able to hold our hearts, she was the one that got us through this movie. Elizabeth Banks was able to go as over-the-top as only pregnant movie heroines are allowed to and gave it her all to deliver the comedy of what not to expect. Of course, it wasn&apos;t quite enough because we do know exactly what to expect.",

      "reviewBody": "If viewers are looking for the haunting, dystopian vistas and devastating landscapes from Stalenhag&apos;s book, they&apos;ll be disappointed. But there are amazing and captivating effects, practical and digital, that build a unique world vision.\n\nWhat this film has going for it is Chris Pratt and Millie Bobby Brown (more on them later), combining with a talented group of voice actors. Tucci is as good as ever but his part is thinly developed. Giancarlo Esposito brings his trademark gravitas and emotional weight to the story as well, in a role that, while not perfectly written, provides a surprising part of the movie&apos;s center.\n\nThe Mr Peanut (Woody Harrelson) role, for me, didn&apos;t quite work. The &quot;bots&quot; I enjoyed were Herm ( unrecognizably voiced by Anthony Mackie) and the postal bot Penny Pal (Jenny Slate).\n\nThere are definite plot holes, but considering the at times preposterous world we&apos;re in, is it worth complaining about story gaps? The robot cavalry makes a long sojourn to their final battlefield in a long caravan that doesn&apos;t get attacked, and improbably makes crazy good time doing it. And there&apos;s the disposal of a very central bot in a very uncaring way that wouldn&apos;t happen, but provides a sentimental wink at the viewer.\n\nHumorous, with lots of crash bang and very cool looking shots, especially with the giant sized robots, it&apos;s just fun enough, and interesting enough to watch all the way through. Pratt and Brown are fun-ish together, and bring their acting talents to a movie from a genre they are both very familiar with, so I do recommend it.\n\nBut Brown feels wrong in this: her appearance as a bounced around foster child feels too &quot;glam&quot; at times, because she isn&apos;t grubby enough. Her acting also feels very much as though she&apos;s going through the paces, almost too self aware. Her fluffed up lip&apos;s lipstick and gloss doesn&apos;t fit with Keats&apos; (Pratt) grimy, disheveled bootlegger.\n\nWhile Brown is given too many &quot;noble&quot; lines to deliver without coming off as sanctimonious, and Pratt is a little too much like Starlord at his most shrill and irritating; you can mostly forgive them because of their innate charm.\n\nThe Russo brothers are definitely talented, so there is a high bar set before you watch the first scene.\n\nBut they made a choice, the scary barren world that the book painted beautifully, is not the direction they picked. Instead they leaned into a little Spielberg, a little Lucas and some James Gunn. It doesn&apos;t make for a perfect movie, but hey, I watched the whole thing and wasn&apos;t mad that I did.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot of kvetching about the big budget and where did it all go. I have two thoughts on that: one, those cool shots of the giant bots, and the very good animatronic facial expressions weren&apos;t cheap. Second, the movie definitely feels like there were a number of scenes that were cut. Quite a few actually. I&apos;d definitely watch the full cut, if there is such a thing. There are many telling points, story jumps being one, but Holly Hunter is too much of an accomplished actress to appear in one scene, and a voiceover.\n\nSo, give it a watch, you won&apos;t be mad that you did, and if you are, well, there&apos;s worse things to be mad at.\n\nJust don&apos;t expect to be blown away, and hoping for a new franchise.",

      "reviewBody": "A film with the same subject (England&apos;s most successful queen), the same leading actress (Cate Blanchett) and the same director (Shekhar Kapur) as the wonderful 1998 work &quot;Elizabeth&quot; excites great expectations and, while there are many jewels here, sadly all that glitters is not gold. As with the earlier movie, it looks magnificent, with wonderful locations. sets, and costumes, and the camera work is stunning with clever compositions and remarkable fluidity and angles. Again the acting is particularly fine with Blanchett a tour de force.\n\nThe focus is narrower in time, beginning in 1585 and climaxing with the defeat of the Spanish Armada three years later in action scenes absent from the first film. The main problem is the script from Michael Hirst &amp; William Nicholson. The narrative is too slow and too confused and some of the lines are somewhat banal, while the attempt to create a romantic storyline between the &apos;virgin&apos; queen and the adventurer Walter Raleigh (an able Clive Owen) is too contrived and unlikely."

Jeunet has mastered the film medium giving &apos;A Very Long Engagement&apos; a unique and fairy tale like visual style. Though rushed, the fantasy romance that Jeunet paints through flashbacks is inspiring. The graphic World War I trenches, provide an excellent contrast to the simple but charming mystery that Mathilde embarks on through the film.\n\nAlthough Jeunet relies heavily on Audrey Tautou&apos;s performance, it is ultimately his one of a kind visual style that emotionally ties the viewer. This said, the latter portion of &apos;Long Engagement&apos; feels very rushed and isn&apos;t treated to the same elegance that so well defines the first half. There are moments in the film where the visuals far overshadow the emotional intensity intended for the scene. This is perhaps &apos;Long Engagements&apos; only fault, as it becomes unbalanced. The stylized and even cartoonish artistic direction that Jeunet leans to, although brilliant seems I&apos;ll fit for this wartime drama. Even so, &apos;A Very Long Engagement&apos; comes off genuine and it&apos;s mix of fantasy romance and war will let you leave the theater fulfilled."

      "reviewBody": "Although I recognize the fact that I&apos;m a guy and shouldn&apos;t like chick flicks anyway, Legally Blonde 2 was ridiculous on so many levels that after watching the movie I had to lower my head in shame.\n\nThe first LB movie, while not very funny, was still entertaining to watch because it actually had effort put into the storyline. It was interesting to see a fashion-obsessed blonde in pink apparently not fitting in at Harvard law school. They tried the same approach with LB2, only with her walking into congress buildings wearing her all pink outfits. However, since we&apos;ve already seen that attempt at humor in the first movie, it just wasn&apos;t anything special.\n\nAside from that, the plot outline was horrible. Basically, Elle Woods (Witherspoon) is having an upcoming wedding where she plans to invite the mother of her pet dog. She discovers that the dog&apos;s mother is in a lab, where they were testing fingernail polish on the dog&apos;s nails. Elle got sad and was like &apos;I am going to go to DC and make it illegal for them to test on animals!&apos; The viewer, however, doesn&apos;t really care, realizing that putting nail polish on a dog&apos;s nails really isn&apos;t that big of a deal, but hey.\n\nI&apos;m not trying to sound mean, but I just can&apos;t really think of anything good about this movie. Every single joke used in the movie was either not funny or recycled from the first one. The entire concept of the plot is just retarded. It even seemed Reese was half-assing her acting job through the movie, doing even worse than she did in the first film. Nobody else in the movie will be nominated for any Oscars, either.\n\nIt just seemed that some filmmaker wanted to cash in from the first movie&apos;s success, knowing that people will pay money to see this movie just because the first one was popular. All of the production team&apos;s effort went into marketing and hype and they just didn&apos;t put enough into the actual movie itself.\n\n2 out of 10"

His son Connor escapes and finds help from smokejumper Hannah Faber (Angelina Jolie).\n\nIn the old days, this would be a mid-level thriller which would come in and be forgotten in a week. Nowadays, it&apos;s a mid-level thriller on streaming that is soon forgotten after being released. It&apos;s a functional movie. It has a bit too much on Hannah&apos;s past trauma. She needs to connect with Connor a bit sooner. Pregnant Rambo is pretty dope. The good news is that most of the characters are pretty smart. There are no overtly stupid moves from these people. Even stupid moves have reasonable excuses. It&apos;s ok. Watch it and forget it.",

      "reviewBody": "That question pretty much sums up my reaction to &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;, a hilarious, yet touching film.\n\nWhat did I like about the movie?  Just about everything!  Michael Caine made a great Scrooge, and this film showed us, possibly better than just about any other version I&apos;ve seen, just how Scrooge came to be such a miser (although that could partly be because the versions I saw which really go into Scrooge&apos;s childhood were clearly adult versions, which meant they could be more subtle in their explanations).  To Caine&apos;s eternal credit, he made Scrooge very believable, which is no small feat considering most of his fellow cast members were puppets.\n\nAnd what about the Muppets?  They were also brilliant!  Kermit made an excellent Bob Cratchit, loyal and humble, and he had a wonderful tribute to Tiny Tim which also served as a brilliant tribute to Jim Henson.  Miss Piggy was a great Mrs. Cratchit, feisty yet very loving toward Bob (the worst of her temper was thankfully muted by the story).  Fozzie the Bear was a hilarious Fozziwig, and The Great Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat made a great team, having some of the best lines out there (my favorite is Rizzo&apos;s &quot;Light the lamp, not the rat!  Light the lamp, not the rat!&quot;).  The ghosts were definitely believable (and in the case of the two Marley Brothers, hilarious as well).  Incidentally, the original text had only one Marley -- Jacob, but to get the two comedians from the balcony in the story, Robert Marley was added.\n\nFinally, the songs were rather good, with the best one (in my humble opinion) being &quot;When Love is Gone&quot;.\n\nSo, I firmly recommend &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; to one and all.\n\nBelle Book"

There was a story to this movie. A very complicated story. If you didn&apos;t notice the story you got distracted by the violence. Some of the dialogue was cheesy but that is what makes it great.\n\nThe only problem I had with the film was the detective role. She seemed to serve zero purpose whatsoever. I am not taking away from the acting done for that role. But every scene she was in was slower and just did not fit with the rest of the movie. Other then acting as a very short winded inner monologue for Bacon&apos;s character, all she did was say no no, your safe, they&apos;re dead, and no. \n\nWe all knew where this movie was going we didn&apos;t need the attempt to turn into a crime drama. \n\nIf you did not like this movie you went into it expecting the wrong thing. This is a revenge movie. It had no supernatural parts. When someone was shot they bled a lot and they were in pain. \n\nIf you ever wanted to exact revenge on someone in your own mind or in your dreams go see this movie it is great.",

      "reviewBody": "Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel&apos;s Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.\n\nNeel&apos;s penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like &quot;friends turned enemies.&quot; The narrative, echoing Neel&apos;s previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.\n\nPrabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.\n\nAction sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it&apos;s like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.\n\nSalaar&apos;s greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film&apos;s relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.\n\nUltimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.\n\nIt descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they&apos;re not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel&apos;s directorial talent.",

It seems like it was given that rating just to drawn attention to the movie because the movie was had about much language, nudity...etc as a R rated movie.\n\nAs for the movie itself.... overhyped trash. This is based on a fictional book and not her true story. It&apos;s sad that she can&apos;t even get a legit story but instead gets a fake version. All that aside the movie is almost 3 hours long. And its very slow moving. There are some disturbing scenes of course, but nothing really shocking compared to other movies.\n\nYou still get the feeling she was abused by everyone of course. But that&apos;s about it. Again, since its not her actual story, it feels like your watching some tabloid version of her life. What a waste of time and such overblown hype. But I know it will win Oscars because &quot;critics&quot; will probably love it for some reason.\n\nOnly reason I even gave it a three was the actress nailed her voice and how she acted.",

Think Close Encounters crossed with Communion with a dash of 2001 and some interstellar thrown in to boot. Plus it has its own originality. It looks great and moves along at a lovely pace. Kaitlyn Dever carries the movie and does it exceptionally well - its a fine perormance by an actress that will grow and grow and I can see her with a Streep like status in a few decades time - you can see it in her face. To the reviewer who skipped through it and claims there is &quot;not one line&quot; of dialogue... well, that&apos;s what you get for skipping.... My one criticism is I didn&apos;t really get the ending, as well done as it was, but that may just be me. I have thoughts on it but hopefully some other reviewer will clarify. This would be best seen on a big screen but regardless of where you see it, I think you will enjoy it and find the 90 minutes flies by. It also stays in your head afterwards which I always think is the mark of a good film. Enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "So, I was actually quite looking forward to this one. I wasn&apos;t expecting much from the original since sequels, prequel&apos;s and spinoffs often times are not up to par with their predecessors. However, I was quite pleasantly surprised with the first Nun and still think that it is a wildly underrated horror. So, after viewing this one, I must say that I was pretty disappointed. It was not a bad film by any means, but it did not live up to the quality of the first one and really landed in a very mediocre place.\n\nIt had a quick start and didn&apos;t waste any time, throwing us into the action. Yet, even then, I stopped and thought &quot;well, that could&apos;ve been cooler &quot;. This same sentiment persisted throughout the majority of the film. It gave us some fun and creepiness, but then proceeded to move at a snails pace for quite some time. It felt like we were about 45 minutes in until I got any semblance of a real story line or something particularly intriguing. It really felt like they were going through the motions, an outline for a horror movie. As if they were following a map with very similar chain of events as the original.\n\nIt is no secret that this franchise loves a jump scare. The first one was full of them, however, it was also balanced out by genuinely creepy and cool effects with a general effective spook factor. This one had a bit of that, but was mostly just riddled with cheap, unnecessary and superfluous jump scares. Even most of the kills, while still entertaining, were pretty basic. At the same time there were also some effective imagery especially in the third act, some gnarly effects, and some pretty awesome stunts that stuck out.\n\nI think my biggest issue with this is that the first one felt very deliberate and purposeful in many ways. It felt planned out and detailed... whereas this one felt like it was thrown together with the very bare minimum they could get away with as far as storyline went. Again, not a bad film, but nowhere near the quality of the first one for me. Would recommend, but not vehemently.\n\n(Also, what&apos;s up with all these fake reviews? Weird. Lol)\n\nIG - howlingatthemoonreviews.",

      "reviewBody": "It is not easy to encapsulate Aloha in a genre. It&apos;s not the usual Rom-Com, although the argument might lead one to believe that yes. The main thread describes the dramatic arc of a man centered on his work, capable of loving, but with difficulty to engage in lasting relationships. In addition, the film explores some manifestations of Hawaiian culture and parody some clichés about military conflicts and conspiracies, with unequal effectiveness.\n\nThe speed with which Aloha travels from one genre to another, sometimes in the middle of the same scene or dialogue, must have confused more than one viewer. It is understood that it has not reached a greater success, between the public and the critic.\n\nBut Aloha has beautiful details to watch and taste, combining serious and emotive subjects with a fine humor, in a delicate balance.\n\nAlso, it is a film with an outstanding casting. The protagonists do their work. Rachel McAdams is charming. It&apos;s a pleasure to see Bill Murray. And it is remarkable the discovery of Danielle Rose Russell, a young actress who delivers a memorable performance, to close a light and touching film, that tackles serious issues without taking them too seriously.",

      "reviewBody": "Ah our precious 1990&apos;s, so many great things came out of this memorable decade, including a streak of teen slasher films. Let&apos;s face it, after the mega success of Scream which opened the doors once again after Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street, we needed a new classic. So naturally all the screen writers who were a bit scared to present their ideas on the table, thanks to Kevin Williamson, the clever writer of Scream and Dawson&apos;s Creek. After that, every teen slasher film was released: the Scream sequels, I Know What You Did Last Summer, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, etc. But we didn&apos;t stop at that, we were now presented with Urban Legend.\n\nThe film begins on a dark and stormy night as college student Michelle Mancini realizes she is near empty while driving in her car. There&apos;s someone in the back seat as Michelle drives, a figure in a dark coat with a fur trim around the hood sits up in the back seat and, with a swift blow from its axe, decapitates Michelle. The same night, on campus, a group of friends listens to Parker Riley tell an old story about one of the campus halls, Stanley Hall. According to the story, in 1973, an abnormal psychology teacher went crazy and killed all the students living in an on-campus residence hall. Paul, a school paper journalist thinks the story is bogus. Still, the story sticks in their minds, especially for Natalie, and Brenda. The next day, the front page of the campus newspaper has an article about Michelle Mancini&apos;s murder written by Paul but the papers are quickly confiscated by school officials. Later that night after going into a secluded area of woods to talk, Natalie reveals to Damon that she knew Michelle, but they hadn&apos;t spoken in years. Damon, playing on Natalie&apos;s vulnerability, tries to make a move on her but she rejects him. Upset, Damon goes into the woods to urinate but is attacked by the killer. He then is hung from a tree in a noose with the rope attached to the bumper of his car. The next day, no one believes Natalie&apos;s story due to Damon&apos;s penchant for pranks and tricks. Realizing both Damon&apos;s death and Michelle&apos;s murder closely resemble famous urban legends, Natalie goes to the library to read up on urban legends. Not realizing the terror has just begun to scare her and her friends even more.\n\nBasically, Urban Legend didn&apos;t stand out against it&apos;s competitors, it has every cliché in the book. Not to mention no memorable actors that had the same chemistry as the cast of Scream. It&apos;s over written at times and has every predictable moment: the friends don&apos;t believe in a ghost story, a couple people get killed off but everyone thinks it&apos;s a prank/fake death, a classic chase scene with a big breasted girl in a skimpy costume, the creepy janitor, the smart girl that no one believes is all of a sudden right about all the murders and of course a mega twist ending that no one will ever see coming! OK, Urban Legend isn&apos;t a horrible movie, while it has all these predictable moments and clichés, it&apos;s still actually fun to watch and a good part of the memory of good teen slasher films that came out of the 1990&apos;s.\n\n6/10",

Classic spy story of bad guy and even worse bad guy want a bad device and will kill all those that get in the way, with a twist on the traditional roles of our main characters. Ghosted gives us everything, love, action, and comedy with a smattering of cameos that are sure to put a smile on your face. Now yes, there are obviously more than a few unbelievable sequences that many action movies have, but overall it works. The chemistry between our main characters is obvious and I love their back and forth with one another. Both Chris and Ana are perfect in their roles and honestly I wouldn&apos;t be mad if there was a sequel.",

      "reviewBody": "This remake of the successful &apos;60&apos;s television show really is a waste of some good potential. It by no means is an horrible movie but the script isn&apos;t really interesting or spectacular and the character treatment is quite poor.\n\nIn a way this movie is a mixed bag. On the one hand it has some good actors in it and some of the special effects are really good but than again on the other hand the story is pretty shallow, the costumes are embarrassingly dreadful and some of the special effects are below average at best. Sounds weird, a movie that has both good and bad special effects in it. It&apos;s a bit weird, it&apos;s like they spend most of the time on the big special effects shots and after that they raffled the rest of the special effects. At times the movie is impressive to watch and at other moments it&apos;s just laughable bad to look at. Such as the CG character Blarp. He (or she?) looked absolutely dreadful and it made the movie even more ridiculous and bad to watch. But perhaps worst thing about the entire character is that it&apos;s a totally, completely unnecessary one that doesn&apos;t add anything to the story at all.\n\nThe movie has a solid cast. John Hurt certainly adds some believability to the silly moments in the movie and he deliverers some of the bad dialog good and even credible. Gary Oldman is of course also a great actor but he plays a bit of an uninteresting villain in this movie that doesn&apos;t get enough opportunity to shine. Matt LeBlanc is most of the time convincing in his role but he at times deliver some cheesy dialog which doesn&apos;t always make him believable as a tough space pilot. Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham also walk around in the movie but they get very little interesting to do. Good in her role was also Lacey Chabert. She&apos;s a good young actress, never really understood why she didn&apos;t appeared in more mainstream big Hollywood productions. She&apos;s an actress with great potential but somehow Hollywood never really picked this up. Maybe it has something to do with the failure of this movie?\n\nBecause yes, this movie is a bit of a failure. Not only in terms of how well it did at the box office and how well it was received by the crowd and critics but also certainly in terms of how the movie is constructed. The script is just disappointingly shallow and has some totally unlikely and unbelievable events in it, that at times don&apos;t even make sense. The story also uses too many elements from the first Star Wars trilogy and even a little bit from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. It doesn&apos;t only uses story elements from that movies, it also rips off the looks of some of the spaceships, planets and city skylights. No, &quot;Lost in Space&quot; certainly isn&apos;t the most original science-fiction movie ever made.\n\nThe movie also lacks some good tension and action sequences. There are too many slow moments in the movie in which totally nothing happens. It&apos;s OK to have some slower moments in a movie but only when the script and characters are good and interesting enough to carry those slower moments. In this movie that really isn&apos;t the case.\n\nThis movie is not a complete disaster and the 4.6 rating here at the moment might be a bit too harsh. The movie does provide some good and entertaining moments. But if only the movie had a better and more original script, than this movie perhaps would had been a bigger success and certainly a better one to watch.\n\n5/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "The big movies about the Vietnam war -- Apocalypse Now, Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket -- didn&apos;t reach the screen until about five years after the war ended. But movies dealing with Iraq and terrorism are cropping up all over even as this war still rages.\n\nWhat exactly that means is hard to know, but it would seem to indicate that no matter which side of the issue they come down on, the filmmakers are willing to risk alienating about half the potential audience in an America more polarized today than at any point in our history.\n\n&quot;In the Valley of Elah&quot; treads lightly on the politics for most of the movie, concentrating on the unfolding mystery of what happened to a young soldier who vanishes shortly after returning from a tour of duty in Iraq. Looking for answers are his father, a former sergeant in the Army&apos;s Criminal Investigation Division, and a young female civilian detective, who gets involved in the case, gets bounced off in a jurisdictional dispute, but winds up back on the case when its determined the crime took place off military property.\n\nWhile director Paul Haggis gets uniformly good performances out of all the characters, the movie belongs to Tommy Lee Jones as the grieving father and Charlize Theron as the determined detective. Both turn in outstanding performances. Jones shines, playing a man who has spent his life holding in his emotions and can&apos;t change now, even as his world falls apart. Theron radiates strength as a woman trying to survive in a sexist police department where all her male colleagues are certain she slept her way into her detective&apos;s job. That is somewhat important to the story, because the movie provides a look into the lower class white community that provides the bulk of the recruits in the all volunteer army.\n\nNone of this really deals with the politics of the war, though, and it is not until the very end of the film that politics come into play, and even there, it is handled with great care. The message is more about the kind of war America finds itself fighting today and what that type of combat does to the men who engage in it. Unlike world wars one and two, Vietnam and Iraq are not wars between easily recognized enemies. We are not battling the Germans or the Japanese. In both Nam and Iraq, Americans find it is difficult to tell friend from foe. That means they often must make snap decisions that sometimes determine whether they themselves live or die. Needless to say, their decisions also determine the fate of the people in the sights of their weapons..\n\n&quot;In the Valley of Elah&quot; does an excellent job of showing that post traumatic stress syndrome is not an oddity, but rather a growing problem in an army of young men whose job requires them to be quick on the trigger.\n\nEvery American should see this movie and then think long and hard about it."

The cast (both in person and voice over) are of the highest calibre and this only adds to the quality.\n\nA note on Downey Jr&apos;s Doctors accent - it is a South Wales accent. Not only did I pick up on this immediately, but I would know... being Welsh and having the very accent myself. He pulls it off with a more than decent attempt.\n\nTo summarise - very good viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "Continuing my plan to watch every Eddie Murphy movie in order, I come to Bowfinger (1999)\n\nPlot In A Paragraph:  A low budget filmmaker (Steve Martin) makes a movie with the biggest action star in the world (Murphy) without his knowledge.\n\nFor his last movie in the 90&apos;s Murphy starred opposite comedy legend Steve Martin and Heather Graham in Frank Oz&apos;s under rated Hollywood satire. He plays a big action star and his goofy brother. I remember thinking it was ok when it came out, and then I never watched it again. I enjoyed it so much this morning, I&apos;m probably going to keep it. I laughed out loud a few times. Murphy looks like he is having fun playing dual roles, which he filmed in six weeks between finishing Life and starting Nutty Professor 2. The freeway scene is the funniest thing I have seen in an Eddie Murphy movie for a long time. Incredibly, executives at Universal wanted to cut that scene, because they felt it would be too expensive!! Martin replied he would not cut the funniest scene in the film.\n\nThis is probably the last time Steve Martin was funny. Heather Graham plays an actress named Daisy, she is allegedly based on Anne Heche. Like Daisy, Heche is from Ohio, was briefly romantically involved with a significantly older man, Steve Martin. Daisy&apos;s last lines about being involved with &quot;the most powerful lesbian in Hollywood&quot; are a reference to Heche&apos;s relationship at the time with Ellen DeGeneres. Of the rest of the cast, Christine Baranski and Terrance Stamp are both fun whilst Robert Donwey Jr has three scenes. This was a bad time to be a Downey Jr fan. He was out on parole, but was constantly missing regular drug tests, resulting in him going back to prison. It was at this sentencing he famously said of his addictions &quot;It&apos;s like I&apos;ve got a shotgun in my mouth, my finger on the trigger and I like the taste of gun metal.&quot;\n\nAmazingly this is based on a real life story from 1927. A Russian filmmaker, covertly shot footage of Mary Pickford on holiday, and made a full movie, based around what he had. \n\nI remember this opening the same weekend as The Sixth Sense. It got very good reviews, but was not a runaway hit. Which is a shame because it may be the last really funny movie either Murphy or Martin ever starred in.\n\nBowfinger grossed $66 million at the domestic box office (on a $55 million budget) to end the year, the 35th highest grossing movie of 1999.",

I will say that Thomas Jane was expertly cast for this role, and he really lived up to the role in every sense. He was very believable and pulled it off quite nicely.\n\nThe rats were a fantastic image of Wilfred&apos;s guilt gnawing at him and gradually breaking down his psyche. There was a very good atmosphere throughout the entire movie.\n\nThe great costumes and make-up also helped the movie along quite nicely.\n\nIf I have to put my finger on something here, then I would say that the storyline did suffer from being somewhat predictable though.",

      "reviewBody": "Few critics, few including Rediff ones whom I look for some good writing, have rated low to BMB. The reason they give is that movie lacks coherence and clarity. Really? I think they should only rate Hollywood movies because whoever thinks this movie is no good does not know what Hindi cinema is. Farhan has done an awesome job, and if I say awesome then it is not for his physique and dialogue delivery but for the transformation, he has gone to become Milkha Singh. We as an audience witness the physical stress and labor that an athlete as likes of Milkha Singh undergo to become a &apos;flying Sikh&apos;. Hindi cinema celebrates the life of this living legend with songs and drama and music. Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra has done a decent job, still; I fell he could have done a lot better especially in the scenes of Milkha&apos;s childhood memories. His attempt of giving the movie an epic convention seriously affected the narrative portion. However, all this can be sided by the grandeur of Farhan&apos;s effort. I would like to mention a statement of one of the rediff users who wrote against critics who are undermining the effect of this movie: &quot;note that 400mtrs is a very difficult race to run. it is at the border of quick races and long jogs. after partition India did not have either the experience nor the infra to produce runners for 400mtrs. So Milkha was a true champion in every sense. If critics pull films like these down for abstract reasonswe will forever have 20 goons flying in the air with one punch from one man. Grow up critics.&quot;\n\nSo true.",

No one was able to be viewed as a &quot;good guy&quot; because, given the right circumstances, we all harbor terrible passions that can be let out if allowed. In this movie, they show &quot;how it all started&quot; but in doing so, they couldnt help but pander to a certain group of people who want to make all white people evil and all black and poor people victims. Even the black gangsters who routinely kill and spread evil over the world end up being shown as &quot;true heroes&quot;. Why does everything have to be &quot;this group is good, this group is bad&quot;? There are good and bad in ALL groups and that is what made Purge so awesome. I doubt I will watch any more of these films. Trust Hollywood elite to ruin a good thing because they cant keep their opinions to themselves.",

Like coming to the end of an exceptional book, you&apos;ll hope for more, surely another way to eke out a Lisbeth Salander film to enjoy. She has become with this trilogy one of the strongest female characters in 21st century film. No wonder actresses were battling to play her--she is the equivalent to Jason Bourne in any regard. (I can&apos;t imagine Hollywood doing a better job of these films--can you?)\n\nI believe Hornet&apos;s Nest is best of the bunch. Salander is cornered, in hospital and under arrest, in danger of being recommitted to the institution that held her under guardianship. Despite her uncommunicative nature, Salander has friends, true friends who&apos;ll stick their necks out to protect her. But Salander is always willing to fight for herself, and she finds ways to do battle.\n\nHornet&apos;s Nest gives us a better film than the other in terms of suspense and dramatic flow. The pieces assemble, the foes are distinguished from the good guys, there is conflict and threat launched in surprising ways. Of the three, Hornet&apos;s Nest is the most suspenseful and best executed of the films in my opinion, a superb finish to a wonderful series.\n\nExcuse me while I start reading the books.",

The cameras stays very tight, action is all blurred and close up, so you can&apos;t see what&apos;s going on. The sound track is all keyed up so you won&apos;t be concentrating on the errors in the action. (Which you can&apos;t really see anyway) Golly, give me the days of good stuntmen back again.\n\nI liked the opening half hour or so, but the middle is so much like a North American Indian film you lose all sense of the time period. I agree with the former reviewers comments, Gee, if the Britains lived like this why bother with them.\n\nI prefer the mini-series &quot;Rome&quot; to this any day.\n\nThe theater chains are also destroying the movie going experience as I have to agonize over 15 minutes of commercials before the main feature starts.",

      "reviewBody": "n the land of the blind, only Julianne Moore can see. A weird malady has spread across an unnamed city that causes “white blindness” in the afflicted. Moore plays the wife of an eye doctor (Mark Ruffalo) who fakes having the disease so that she be quarantined with her husband (and the other early sufferers). The patients quickly learn that they’re on their own and that any attempts to leave the facility will result in their being shot to death. As the only sighted person, Moore literally sees the inmates/patients devolve into misery and must somehow lead a small band of them to the presumed safety of the outside world.\n\nThe movie begins rather strongly, as a young man is suddenly blinded while driving on a busy city street. Disoriented, he is helped by a passerby, who takes him home but steals his car. Meanwhile, an ophthalmologist’s office begins to fill up with people experiencing this odd blindness, not one of inky blackness but of complete whiteness. The following morning, the doctor wakes up with the same blindness, and the only way Mrs. Eye Doctor can go with him is by pretending she too has the (apparently) infectious disease.\n\nThe patients are kept in maximum-security barracks and are given sparse amounts of food that they must dole out to each other. But that’s the extent of their outside help; armed guards surround the buildings and shoot to kill anyone who tries to leave. (Lest they, you know, infect normal people.) So it’s not long before the denizens of one section (ward) decide they want more than their share, and anarchy ensues, which is compounded by nearly everyone’s lack of sight. (The doctor’s wife – everyone’s unnamed – keeps her own condition a secret from everyone except her husband.) The movie is a metaphor for the hatred within human beings for one another; it seeks to show that when the chips are down, we are just animals, even if we suffer the same indignities, because each of us wishes to be better than the next, to dominate. We are not, the movie argues, a society built solely on equality. It also seeks to show that there are different kinds of blindness: physical blindness, and the blindness of man to the suffering of his fellows.\n\nAlthough the film is exquisitely well shot – from desolate city streets to the unencumbered chaos within the compound’s walls – it’s alternately slow moving and predictable. It’s easy to see what will happen once the victims are quarantined, and it’s even easier to see that the doctor’s wife will be the one to lead some of them out of the morass. Although Moore is excellent as always (as are Ruffalo, Danny Glover as an eye-patch-wearer, and Alice Braga as a blind hooker), her character seems to be less a victim and accidental leader than a chosen heroine, which runs contrary to the theme of everyday people simply trying to survive without sight. Moore’s character, the only character with sight, is presented as being a good person, but she is very slow to stop what are obviously Very Bad Things being done to the blind.\n\nAside from the blindness angle, there isn’t much here to separate this film from other personal-disaster films (to differentiate them from natural-disaster films, which would include earthquakes, tidal waves, and tornados), such as movies about plagues (28 Days Later), zombies (Dawn of the Dead), or infectious diseases (Outbreak). The idea that people would turn on each other even though they suffer together is not new; neither is the idea of a society (in this case, an entire city) abandoning those who all have some sort of disease. And because these ideas aren’t new, Blindness isn’t as compelling as it ought to be; the characters are generally one dimensional and unlikeable, so this isn’t even much of a feel-good movie. To tell the truth, it’s a bit of a lifeless downer, although the ending makes up for it a little.\n\nA final note: The American Council of the Blind said, in deploring the movie, that “blind people do not behave like uncivilized, animalized creatures.” That’s simply a silly statement. Anyone can behave as an uncivilized, animalized creature, particularly if they are treated as animals and quarantined from “normal” society (which was the point of the director, Fernando Meirelles); to believe that blind people are not susceptible to anger, despair, and revenge is to believe that blindness somehow connotes angelic heroism, which is unfair toward blind people as well.",

I thought it was gonna be terrible, but it was actually one of the best slasher movies that have come out in recent years. The plot is simple, characters are simple, and the kills are amazing. At the beginning of this movie almost none of the characters are likeable. And to be honest, they don&apos;t get likeable until maybe halfway through the film. The acting isn&apos;t great either, Patrick Dempsey(the sheriff) was easily the best of the whole cast. There&apos;s also so really corny lines and cheesy moments but it&apos;s a slasher and they always come with that. The highlight of this entire movie is the way characters are killed off because it&apos;s straight up brutal. The movie doesn&apos;t shy away from showing blood and guts, and from what we could see only maybe two of the deaths are CGI, the rest looked like practical effects, and there&apos;s so much death. From the start of the movie you can just tell it&apos;s gonna be a wild ride. The ending was kind of weird and not at all what you expect, I guess kind of setting up a sequel, not really sure actually. But definitely a fun movie to enjoy if you have nothing better to watch.",

      "reviewBody": "In the late 1950&apos;s the TV game show &quot;Twenty-One&quot; was rigged. Popular contestants who could grab ratings were fed the questions and answers, and those who the network wanted off were told to take dives, all for the sake of keeping ratings up and selling Geritol. &quot;Quiz Show&quot; is the story of the scandal, and of the potential danger of the power of television. The movie focuses around two contestants in particular: Herbert Stempel (John Turturro), the reigning champ at the start of the movie who the network decides it wants to dump in favour of someone more glamorous who can pull in higher ratings: Charles Van Doran (Ralph Fiennes), a college literature professor. Stempel feels cheated of the glory that he feels was his due, while Van Doran is tormented by his desire to tell the truth, but also to cover up his involvement in the scandal.\n\nThis is an interesting film that gives a fascinating look at the inside workings of the TV game show of that era. And it does paint a fascinating moral dilemma. As Dan Enright (David Paymer) - Twenty-One&apos;s producer - says to the Congressional committee that investigates the scandal, this was after all just a TV show; by definition a piece of entertainment. The sponsor sold its product, the network got ratings, the contestants made money and the public got entertained. Where was the victim? And yet it WAS dishonest. It&apos;s a fascinating issue, this whole concept of a victimless crime. And the ultimate irony was summed up by Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), the head Congressional investigator: the Committee got Van Doran, but what he wanted was to get television. In the end, as he says, television will probably end up getting them.\n\nAll in all this was an interesting movie, although - strangely for a true story - I felt it lacked any sustained dramatic intensity. Remembering Jack Barry from the 1970&apos;s as host of the game show &quot;The Joker&apos;s Wild&quot; (he was also the host of &quot;Twenty-One&quot;), I was very impressed by Christopher McDonald&apos;s portrayal of him. Although the role wasn&apos;t really that central to the movie, McDonald had Barry down pat, and I felt as if it really were Jack Barry I was watching.\n\nAll in all, this is a very good movie. I wouldn&apos;t run out and buy it, but it&apos;s certainly worth a rental.\n\n7/10",

If I could rate this movie in the negatives, I would. If I had one wish, I would rid the world of Justin Beiber all together. This movie is painful to sit through. Do not waste your money. There&apos;s no thought process whatsoever. This talentless teenager belongs back where he started; on Youtube. He definitely shattered all hopes of ever being on the big screen again.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always thought of Val Kilmer as a secondary actor. Iceman in &quot;Top Gun&quot; and playing a second-rate Batman compared to Michael Keaton. But I was proved wrong in &quot;The Saint&quot;, which pushes acting to the limit with Kilmer playing a variety of characters very well, and also having romantic and action scenes.\n\n&quot;The Saint&quot; features Simon Templar, aka The Human Fly (Kilmer), who travels the world in disguise to steal and sell whatever he can for the highest price. Things become more complicated when he must steal from a beautiful physicist (Elisabeth Shue).\n\nI thought Shue was especially flaky, as was her character. How a beautiful woman who knows cold fusion does not get a date is beyond me. Also, how a world-famous physicist can dress and act like a high school cheerleader is also a bit odd. But I guess it&apos;s possible. On a related note, this is Shue&apos;s most beautiful appearance. I cannot even recognize her as the girl next door of &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; or &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;.\n\nI&apos;m also not sure if the best way to cure hypothermia is to take off all your clothes, because that is not what I learned in Boy Scouts. But I&apos;m not a physicist.\n\nOtherwise, great film. The costume and makeup department deserved an Oscar. If they didn&apos;t get one, I scream foul because I have never seen more convincing makeup and hair extensions in a film before. Kilmer was able to play roughly six characters that were all lifelike and quite distinguishable.\n\nThe fights were great, especially when Kilmer donned his ninja gear and fought the Russian mafia. Breathtaking. And what a great choice to play the Russian villain. Charismatic, strong actor and powerfully menacing.\n\nThis almost makes me want to see the original TV series, though I think I&apos;d be disappointed. This film is a must-see for all people, action fans or not. The romance and comedy easily rival the action.",

BUT...if you were looking for a thrilling, fast paced roller-coaster, that&apos;s what you will find.\n\nFor the past year, I have been seeking out alternatives to American cinema because it has become so formulaic and awful. I troll IMDb and eBay to see what else is happening in the world. Sure, B13 is derivative, but it is certainly more exciting than another &quot;re-imagining&quot; of a 70s cop show.\n\nThe opening sequence took my breath away. I was half-way through the film before I felt it was sage to dart to the kitchen for a drink. I said to my wife &quot;THIS is the movie I&apos;ve been searching for.&quot; Even the subtitles were good. The verbiage and spelling were very authentic and slang-conversational. It did not feel forced as many foreign films do. It was definitely subbed with the British market in mind, as some of the banter evoked thoughts of Lock, Stock or Layer Cake or Football Factory.\n\nIf I want a truly compelling story, I&apos;ll look elsewhere, but check out B13 for the some great fight scenes, excellent scenery and mind-blowing athleticism.",

Jet Li was okay, but I don&apos;t think he&apos;s a good actor although he &apos;s a very prolific one starring in over 60 movies. Although this was her acting debut, I think Aaliyah brought the goods to the table. She was just great as Trish. The play between Trish and Han (Jet Li) as an accidental cab driver was priceless, and the way they contrasted each other on screen with younger Trish actually in somewhat of a protective role to Han really added interesting plot twist to the story. Executive producer Joel Silver had lots of original ideas about movie making, and this one I would say is one of them. I don&apos;t go too much for the violence, but the movie was entertaining and original.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1965 producer Kevin McLory -who owns a part of the Bond cinematic rights- associate with EON Productions (Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli) for making &quot;Thunderball&quot;, the fourth film of the 007 franchise. The star is Sean Connery, of course.\n\nIn 1982 McLory wins a legal battle and can produce an &quot;independent&quot; Bond film. &quot;Never say never again&quot; (NSNA) is one of the two &quot;unofficial&quot; 007 films made outside EON (the other is the 1967 comedy spoof &quot;Casino Royale&quot;). NSNA is a remake of &quot;Thunderball&quot; and stars the original Bond, Sean Connery -who comes back to the role after many years of absence.\n\nThe film is released some months after &quot;Octopussy&quot; with Roger Moore, the 13th episode of the EON series. At the time press calls it &quot;War of the Bonds&quot;... Both films are a big success in 1983, even if &quot;Octopussy&quot; earns more money at the box office.\n\nNSNA is a luxurious film made by excellent technicians -director Irvin Kershner who led &quot;The Empire strikes back&quot;, Douglas Slocombe -cinematographer of &quot;Raiders of the lost Ark&quot;-, and screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr -who wrote &quot;The three days of the Condor&quot;- among others...\n\nThe cast is excellent with Connery, a then relatively unknown Kim Basinger, Barbara Carrera, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Edward Fox...\n\nAlthough all that the film remains inferior to the original &quot;Thunderball&quot;. It lacks many fundamental ingredients for being a real Bond movie: there&apos;s not the traditional gun barrel sequence, there&apos;s not the &quot;James Bond theme&quot;, M and Q are not played by the traditional actors... It&apos;s a copyright reason: EON only is allowed to use these elements. Briefly, NSNA lacks the classic cinematic 007 atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand the film is exciting and enjoyable. Brandauer is a very good villain and the women (Basinger and Carrera) are sensual and gorgeous. But the main highlight is Sean Connery! He&apos;s once again wonderful in the role, he&apos;s older but looks fitter and nicer here than in &quot;Diamonds are forever&quot;, his last performance in the role of the British super-spy before NSNA.",

Really phenomenal film. It&apos;s from the perspective of the rescue mission, so be prepared about that. It was so intense and stressful to watch! You know the story but actually watching what happened is much worse. It&apos;s really heartbreaking at times. I thought I would cry more but I burst into tears at the end. I think they were tears of relief honestly. Lol I had been holding in so much stress. Everyone in the film did a phenomenal job and the character Viggo played, Rick, was at our screening. So much respect for This man and all the others who stayed calm under pressure! I only took a point away because the movie gets started practically right away And I would have liked a little more connection to the boys first. Maybe that was the point though.",

      "reviewBody": "Sadly due to the lack of availability of &apos;Open Your Eyes&apos; in Australia (until now) I saw Cameron Crowe&apos;s &apos;Vanilla Sky&apos; first. Too bad. &apos;Open Your Eyes&apos; is the original and best version, and would have impressed me even more if the surprises in the plot hadn&apos;t been ruined for me by the remake. So I strongly urge you to watch this movie first for maximum impact. It&apos;s a real killer, and especially recommended if you are a fan of mind-blowing movies such as Frankenheimer&apos;s underrated &apos;Seconds&apos;, Cronenberg&apos;s brilliant &apos;Videodrome&apos; and &apos;eXistenZ&apos;), or have read a Philip K.Dick novel or two.\n\n Eduardo Noriega (star of Amenabar&apos;s previous movie, the taut, suspenseful &apos;Tesis&apos;, also worth a look) is much more believable than Tom Cruise as the increasingly baffled protagonist caught in a never-ending nightmare, and Penelope Cruz&apos;s performance here is subtler and more appealing than her reprise of Sofia in Crowe&apos;s overblown and self-indulgent remake. Alejandro Amenabar has made three excellent imaginative thrillers in a row, and looks like being one of the most potentially exciting directors currently working. &apos;Open Your Eyes&apos; comes with my highest recommendation. This one is essential viewing."

      "reviewBody": "The snowy white landscapes of Oslo seemed like the perfect setting for chilling crime thriller The Snowman, a film based on Jo Nesbø&apos;s novel of the same name. The trailers promised so much and with a lead actor like Michael Fassbender on board, it had the potential to be one of the most intense films of the year. \n\nWhen Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) is called to investigate a string of murders where the killer leaves snowmen as a calling card, he must delve into past cases to make a connection before the killer strikes again.\n\nFor a crime thriller to work, it must grip the audience right through to the end. The first half of The Snowman had my full attention, unsure of where the story was going to go or what would be revealed however, as the film drew on and revelations were made, it utterly lost me due to how lazy it became. They storytelling that felt so strong in the first half was totally absent in the second, none of the revelations as impactful as they should have been and the ending coming so abruptly. I hate the fact the film didn&apos;t seem to wrap up this story properly before closing with such a sequel baiting final scene.\n\nAs with Tomas Alfredson&apos;s previous films, the pacing is pretty slow however, unlike Let the Right One In and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, the consistence in quality isn&apos;t maintained throughout. Half an hour before the end I was ready for it to finish. Such a shame because this had such potential to be such a creepy thriller, instead the snowmen left as calling cards coming across as more comical than anything.\n\nComing to the performances, The Snowman isn&apos;t exactly let down at all. It&apos;s just they feel a little uninspired considering some of the actors working in the film. Michael Fassbender is one of the best actors working today but even if he looks as if he&apos;s given up on the film towards the end. I&apos;m still waiting for a Fassbender performance as good as Steve Jobs, and that was two years ago now. While I don&apos;t think anyone gave a bad performance, the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Val Kilmer, Toby Jones and J. K. Simmons were left a little too underused for my liking.\n\nA film of two halves for me, starting so promisingly before fizzling out to such an unsatisfying finale, The Snowman is rather annoyingly one of the biggest disappointments of the year.",

      "reviewBody": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) is a movie that my daughter and I caught today at an advanced screening. The storyline follows the Ninja Turtles as they become teenagers and obsessed with the human world. They run into a reporter, named April, who accidentally convinces them that becoming heroes will help people adjust to them. They target a recent crime spree that happens to be executed by mutants that may be tied to their past.\n\nThis movie is codirected by Jeff Rowe (The Mitchells versus the Machines) and Kyler Spears (directorial debut) and contains the voices of Jackie Chan (Rush Hour), John Cena (The Suicide Squad), Ice Cube (Friday), Seth Rogen (Superbad), Paul Rudd (Ant-man), Post Malone (Wrath of Man), Giancarlo Giuseppe (Breaking Bad) and Rose Byrne (Insidious).\n\nThis is a rather uneven addition to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles universe. The storyline set-up, and background of the turtles, is perfectly executed and entertaining. The animation was excellent and almost had a claymation feel it at times. The voices were well selected and it was impossible to not love Ice Cube and Jackie Chan, who were both terrific. Despite how good Ice Cube was in this, I don&apos;t think I loved his character as the main villain. They took too many non-traditional twists with the mutants and turtles that it kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I will say the soundtrack was excellent. It might have been the best part of the movie.\n\nOverall, this is definitely entertaining and worth a watch but I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s the reboot we were looking for. I would score this a 6-6.5/10 and recommend seeing it once.",

The film is also casting some of the great actors of our time, not just from France but from everywhere.\n\nMy favorite segments:\n\n14th arrondissement: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, comes to Paris to learn French and also to make a sense of her life.\n\nMontmartre: there was probably not a better way to start this movie than with this segment on romantic Paris.\n\nLoin du 16ème: an image of Paris that we are better aware of since the riots in the Cités. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time taking care of somebody else&apos;s kid (she&apos;s a nanny) than of her own.\n\nQuartier Latin: so much fun to see Gérard Depardieu as the &quot;tenancier de bar&quot; with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing their divorce.\n\nTour Eiffel: don&apos;t tell me you didn&apos;t like those mimes!\n\nTuileries: such a treat to see Steve Buscemi as the tourist who&apos;s making high-contact (a no- no) with a girl in the Metro.\n\nParc Monceau: Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sagnier also.\n\nI&apos;ve spend 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to go back!\n\nSeen in Barcelona (another great city), at the Verdi, on March 18th, 2007.\n\n84/100 (***)",

Some of their richest and most respectable members have poured millions of Dollars into the IRA, harboured some of their members, idealised the notion of a &quot;fight for freedom&quot;. Believe me, as a Scot, with William Wallace et al I&apos;ve always had a certain affinity for heroes. But the IRA are no heroes. They&apos;ve become Northern Ireland&apos;s drug-dealers, extortioners, gangsters. The people of Ireland as whole have had enough of them and their way of terrorising innocent people. May it be the IRA or the UDP, the notion of a Catholic V Protestant jihad has long ago turned into a simple cycle of self-perpetuating violence. These men and women are no longer anything resembling the oh-so glorious Michael Collins, they are terrorists who don&apos;t know when to quit and never knew anything but how to fight. These men aren&apos;t the Brad Pitts of the world, nor is the British Army an oppressor anymore (considering that over 90% of the locals support the Army, simply because it provides protection). Yet in 1997 we still got the great toss of this movie, showing us how brave Irishmen fight against an onslaught of British stormtroopers and evil S(I)S men. Somehow it seems that America is hell-bent on keeping up the idea of the stiff upper-lip English villain. May it be The Devil&apos;s Own, Braveheart, U-571 or most recently The Patriot, Hollywood seems bent on demonising the US&apos; closest ally, both politically and culturally. I may not be a great fan of the English, but even I know what harm stereotypes can do. Perhaps the writer should have gone out to the streets of Belfast and asked ordinary people what they think of the IRA. Perhaps the writer should have also approached a soldier and asked him what it&apos;s like to occupy Northern Ireland. Somehow, I have severe doubts that a movie about the post-WW2 SS-&quot;Werwölfe&quot; guerillas would be quite so romanticised.\n\nAnd this movie has a Riverdance sequence. Oh please...."

      "reviewBody": "Of what I&apos;ve read from other reviewers, almost all are horribly misinterpreting this film. In it, Alex Garland returns to his British roots and goes for a supernatural body-horror with spins from both ancient mythologies and modern woke-ism. Reviewers condemn the movie for its use of anti-manliness, pro-womanhood, and fear of masculinity. Do any of them know what the film is actually about? It&apos;s about The Green Man, from ancient Pagan mythology (Wikipedia: Green_Man). He was a pre-historic god of fertility and rebirth, as showcased in the last scenes of the movie. In the movie, he is portrayed as at first a mischievous, then threatening, then moral-ground-testing supernatural being. Most reviewers interpret his presence completely wrong and see the film as though the main protagonist (a woman) is being attacked by the men in the world who surround her. Her husband&apos;s outrage is almost relatable until he hits her, and the men she runs into are mysteriously sinister, but not violent. Only when she has to defend herself does the movie become about physical violence. In reality, The Green Man is mimicking the bodies of the men in her life and manifesting them for her judgment. Alex Garland&apos;s Annihilation was great, and Civil War was outstanding, but this is an often overlooked and misunderstood movie in his catalog. I, personally, took off some points from my score because of how it was bogged down by interpretations of the men in the movie, as well because I prefer more blood in my body-horrors. But it was a pretty good movie, nonetheless.",

      "reviewBody": "Megan (Analeigh Tipton) is a beautiful young woman troubled by her own singularity. She hates being single and fears she is seeing the best years of her love-life rush by her and can do nothing but passively watch them dissolve before her eyes. Catering to her desperation, she creates an account on a website dedicated to matching singles up with one another and connects with Alec (Miles Teller). The two meet and wind up having great sex together, with Megan presuming she can just leave as soon as she wakes up the next morning. This method of avoiding anything in the way of romantic feelings, however, is prevented given a huge blizzard is taking place outside, making travel of any kind next to impossible. Megan is forced to reside at Alec&apos;s until further notice, making for an ostensibly awkward but thoroughly revealing evening as the two talk about past relationships, critique each others sexual practices, and spend time nosily prying into the lives of one another.\n\nThe premise for Max Nichols&apos; Two Night Stand is made slightly more original given the fact that the idea of millennial relationships is a fairly topical, sociological talking point at the moment. I just recently saw an article stating that numerous young people don&apos;t even know the status of their own relationships, as the modern world has populated so much of romanticism with casual hookups, &quot;hangouts,&quot; and acts of &quot;seeing&quot; people with little or no commitment involved. The characters, the structure, and the ending of Two Night Stand, however, make the film something of another romantic comedy, but exploring a reasonably believable scenario about failing to have your cake and eat it too. They thought they were getting carefree sex without any kind of personal relations to follow...what they got was a window to themselves from a complete stranger.\n\nTwo Night Stand&apos;s commitment to perfunctory plot-points (including a pretty senseless ending) are saved by screenwriter Mark Hammer&apos;s reliance on conversation in the film, and, most importantly, the performances of Tipton and Teller, two young actors to watch in the coming years, with Teller being the more prominent one. Starting out finding his footing in amoral comedies like 21 &amp; Over and Project X, Teller has grown into a seriously likable and human screen-presence, inhabiting the role of the cocky yet vulnerable young adult, determined, but somewhat directionless, and friendly, but also contemptible at times. His versatility is the glue holding Two Night Stand together when lengthy conversations between the two parties take place, resulting in pleasantly lyrical discussions about topics that are finally starting to find themselves more prominent in film.\n\nSex is not an uncommon thing to see in films anymore; the discussion of sex, romance, love, and marriage from the perspective of the people who most often engage in it - teenagers and young adults - are a bit harder to find. Two Night Stand finds itself released and promoted around the same time as #Stuck, another film about an extended hookup that results in the male driving the female home and both of them getting stuck in a record-breaking traffic jam. The evasion of feelings and any form of commitment is something that we can see in films with millennial characters, and when they finally are forced to tackle it is when we have an intriguing film on our hands.\n\nAs I said before, Two Night Stand is burdened by an ending all too conventional and a structure far too similar. However, the recommendation in this case is for you to see two talents, who will soon find themselves in roles with more potential and possible accolades to affirm that, tackle material, as of now, rarely committed to film. It&apos;s a treat to watch Tipton and Teller interact with one another, and an even greater one to know the best is yet to come for both of these young actors.\n\nStarring: Miles Teller and Analeigh Tipton. Directed by: Max Nichols.",

XXX: The Next Level as released on the Philippines.\n\nHaving said that, it wouldn&apos;t be a surprise that this movie was just one action scene after another. Although a lot of negative feedbacks are here about the plot and the characters this movie is sure to satisfy the typical action movie fanatic. True to the reputation of that aforementioned James Bond movie there never was a dull moment in the movie. The pace and the tension of this movie just keeps the story flowing with slight stops to help you catch your breath and ingest the movie if aren&apos;t trashing it already.\n\nI admit that upon seeing Ice Cube as the one to play the role of the new Triple X I was skeptical about his capabilities. Having the typical role of a bad-ass, the attitude and situations really suit him. I wasn&apos;t totally disappointed. However, it was sort of a plot hole for them to consider Xander Cage as being less of a character than Darius Stone. I actually didn&apos;t like that idea. I&apos;m still confused whether their mention of the previous Triple X being killed as a cover up or a fact. Hey, this is a gov&apos;t agency! One can never assume.\n\nAs usual for most action movies this is another marketing scheme for brand products from Ice Cube&apos;s backpack to his gadgets and, of course, the hot cars, which I admit are the top of the line.\n\nIf you&apos;re just another movie fanatic after a good rush this movie is for you - bang for your buck. But for the discriminating movie fan this will hardly satisfy you. I actually liked this movie regardless of the whole lame plot. Hey, you can&apos;t please everyone!",

      "reviewBody": "Orphaned at a young age by the Rufus Buck Gang, Nat Love (Johnathan Majors) has grown up to form his own gang and has killed the last man who killed his parents while Rufus Buck (Idris Elba) rots in prison and now seeks to rekindle his relationship with former partner and lover Stagecoach Mary (Zazie Beetz). Rufus Buck&apos;s lieutenants, Trudy Smith (Regina King) and Cherokee Bill (Lakeith Stanfield) make a deal with the government in exchange for a pardon for Rufus Buck, and Buck and his gang head to the all-black town of Redwood City and remove the corrupt sheriff and former member of Buck&apos;s gang, Wiley Escoe (Deon Cole) from power asserting the town under Rufus Buck&apos;s authority. When Nat Love gets wind that Rufus Buck is free and rebuilding his power, Love reassembles his gang with Mary, Jim Beckwourth (RJ Cyler), Bill Pickett (Edi Gathegi), and Cuffee (Danielle Deadwyler) with help from U. S. Marshal Bass Reeves (Delroy Lindo) who&apos;s mutually interested in taking down Rufus Buck.\n\nSince appearing on the scene in supporting roles in films like Hostiles and White Boy Rick and the TV docudrama miniseries When We Rise playing Young Ken Jones, Johnathan Majors has slowly but surely become a major actor to look out for scoring leads in the short lived HBO horror series Lovecraft Country as well as appearing to strong acclaim in the likes of films such as Da 5 Bloods and The Last Black Man in San Francisco. Produced Will Smith&apos;s Overbrook Entertainment, Musician Shawn Carter (aka Jay-Z), and frequent Quentin Tarantino collaborator Lawrence Bender, the movie is the feature directing debut of musician/music producer Jeymes Samuel who supervised the soundtrack for Baz Luhrmann&apos;s The Great Gatspy and co-wrote the script with Boaz Yakin. The movie features a predominantly black cast and strives to be a stylish musically infused take on gritty revenge westerns and the movie certainly has all the right pieces in place to do so. Unfortunately while the movie has all the right ingredients, they don&apos;t come together as well as you want them to.\n\nStylistically speaking the movie looks amazing, the cinematography and costuming is gorgeous with these very colorful western towns brought to life and integrated with an energized soundtrack helping establish its identity out of the gate. The opening scene where we see Nat Love as a child witness the murder of his parents by Rufus Buck is amazingly done because you don&apos;t see Rufus Buck&apos;s face as he&apos;s shot mostly from the back or from over the shoulder giving him an imposing presence as an antagonist. When the movie does reveal Idris Elba about 40 minutes in where he steps out from the shadows in a well-choreographed train heist sequences that&apos;s both tense as well as stylish it&apos;s probably one of the best villain introductions I&apos;ve seen in a modern western. The action is also quite well done with the impacts nicely conveyed and real sense of brutality to is given to them (especially a scene where Rufus Buck pistol whips a corrupt sheriff in front of a terrified town).\n\nUnfortunately once the novelty of the style wears off after the strong opening introduction the movie becomes less and less engaging as it goes on. A big issue with The Harder They Fall is in its length because the movie clocks in at 2 hours and 19 minutes when it would be better served by being 1 hour and 40 minutes at most. The movie is a pretty straight forward revenge story, and while sometimes those can justify their length (such as Kill Bill Vol.1 and 2) The Harder They Fall doesn&apos;t have the writing or character needed to justify its length down to the fact the movie manufactures a conflict with Stagecoach Mary doing a pretty ill advised action which leads her getting captured by Buck where Buck forces Nat Love to rob a bank in a white town (both literally and figuratively) which seems like it&apos;s only there to stretch the story to this length. You can tell the movie is directed by someone with a music background because not only is the soundtrack often front and center, but several scenes feel like they&apos;re one step away from turning into musical numbers (which actually does happen every so often) and while the look can sometimes be to this film&apos;s advantage such as the colorful buildings that make up Redwood City, othertimes it becomes quite distracting such as the previously mentioned white town where everything, and I do mean everything is painted white in what I guess is supposed to be a joke, but it&apos;s such a broad and exaggerated joke it feels like something that should be in a parody and not in a (somewhat) serious western.\n\nMost of the performances are kind of lost among the style and excess of the rest of the movie. The one major standout who I thought gave a really strong performance was Delroy Lindo playing a fictionalized take on U. S. Marshal Bass Reeves and while the role isn&apos;t written with all that much depth, Lindo gives the character this world weariness that gives some needed weight and investment to the film and gave the character a lot of credibility thanks to his performance. Idris Elba gets a decent introduction with a really strong train robbery set piece, but after that sequence he doesn&apos;t really get to do all that much until the very end of the movie which doesn&apos;t strike the emotional resonance it should. Johnathan Majors is serviceable as the lead, but he&apos;s also not really called upon for any commanding moments where he&apos;s allowed to own the scene and often is just sort of &quot;there&quot;. Majors&apos; Nat Love character has both a revenge plot as well as a romantic plot with Zazie Beetz&apos; Stagecoach Mary and neither Nat Love&apos;s revenge nor his relationship with Stagecoach Mary really comes to a boiling point and feels like it&apos;s stuck on a mild simmer more than anything else.\n\nThe Harder they Fall certainly is stylish and well made, but it&apos;s also not as substantive as it needs to be to justify its near 2 and ½ hour length. I think Jeymes Samuel does have merit as a director and I would like to see him do another movie, but he also needs an editor that can keep his vision focused. There&apos;s a strong performance from Delroy Lindo and some forceful fight sequences and if you are a fan of westerns or Tarantino films this might be worth a one time viewing, but I can&apos;t really give it much more than that.",

      "name": "Visually striking and inventive film that is emotionally engaging and well worth seeking out",
      "reviewBody": "Hunger is a low budget film from a production company more recognisable for its TV work, without any recognisable stars, without a really big distributer to get it around and directed by a Turner Prize winning visual artist making his film debut. Already you would perhaps be considering giving it a miss and maybe this isn&apos;t the best time to mention it is a largely dialogue free account of hunger-striker Bobby Sands set entirely in Northern Ireland&apos;s infamous Maze prison. This is probably one of the reasons that the film hasn&apos;t been as widely seen as it deserves to be or why audiences haven&apos;t flocked into screenings of it on a Saturday night. Certainly it is not an easy watch given the subject matter alone but yet it is a compelling and quite brilliant film.\n\nAlthough the nature of the story leads the viewer to be emotionally invested in one &quot;side&quot; of the situation, McQueen never does anything that opens his film to this suggestion of bias or of scoring political points, if anything his attention to the detail of the tightly focused story does just the opposite. As well as telling us how many hunger strikers died, he point out how many prison guards were murdered during the period and, in my favourite part, introduces us to the prison via one guard soothing his hands (which tells us the frequency of what he does). It is a nice moment but not as telling as the thrill the viewer gets as he checks for bombs and starts his car  we are supposed to be on the edge of our seat and we are, swiftly followed by the realisation that this is an experience we would repeat if we were in his driveway the next day or the next.\n\nFrom here we move into a nearly dialogue free thirty minute opening where no central character really comes forward and our &quot;focus&quot; is on life in the prison for guards and prisoners  a story that almost starts without there being a &quot;story&quot;. The film later brings Bobby Sands to the fore, delivering one impressive dialogue scene before returning to a dialogue-light charting of his hunger strike on the way to the conclusion that we all know is coming. Yet it manages to be really engaging because of the level of each detail in each scene and the relevance of each scene to the overall film. The scene that has gotten all the mentions and praise is the long dialogue scene between Sands and the priest who comes to see him before his strike. Filmed in three distinct shots, the scene is technically impressive but also allows the main dialogue delivery of the film  and the only really moment where anyone is allowed to debate and discuss the actions. Even here McQueen does not allow sides to be taken but keeps it as two men talking. It is engaging, really well written and of course, really well acted.\n\nIt is ironic that in this scene the film sits still for ages and allows the frame to remain the same because for the majority of the film McQueen&apos;s camera is the star. So many shots are striking that it almost becomes &quot;normal&quot; to be transfixed by an image on the screen. Whether it be a excrement-smeared cell, urine flowing down a hall or a man washing blood from his hands, it looks great and the care taken to construct each image fills the &quot;gap&quot; that the dialogue leaves. The performances are mostly very good and compliment the &quot;few words&quot; approach by bringing a lot when required and wearing their characters convincingly. There are some you may recognise but I didn&apos;t. Fassbender is the most memorable as he has the biggest character and the most startling journey, but this should not take away from smaller turns from Graham, Mullen and a few others who are also good. The film is not perfect though. The uninitiated may struggle to understand the bigger picture as you don&apos;t get a lot of help with that and those that don&apos;t get into the telling initially may be left cold by the approach. However these &quot;weaknesses&quot; are not missed targets or failings but rather the &quot;cons&quot; that have to come with the overwhelming pros of the manner of delivery.\n\nHunger is not an easy film to watch but it is a great film. It is wonderfully shot with an artist&apos;s composure but McQueen is not a &quot;visual style&quot; director who doesn&apos;t come with anything else (list your own failed music video director turned film director here) but rather he uses this approach to improve the film and make the telling better. The acting is impressive because of how real they feel and how little dialogue they have across the whole film, but to me the real star was McQueen. He is a visual artist and it shows as he makes the majority of his shots striking and engaging, even if they are not &quot;beautiful&quot;. It may get a bit more exposure due to awards chatter but even if it doesn&apos;t it is certainly worth checking out."

      "name": "Despite its shortcomings, this is one of the better films of Salman which might remind you of finding your own KICK in life before its all over.",
      "reviewBody": "First addressing the people interested in slamming it down due to its avoidable minuses, yes the film defies all logics as always seen in a typical Hindi film aiming at entertaining its larger section of viewers, ignoring the others. It doesn&apos;t offer any fresh or unpredictable storyline taking the easy path. Has a longer length with few unwanted scenes and mediocre songs thrown in uselessly hindering its otherwise likable progression. Takes too long to come to its actual story plot. Has few close resemblances to films like THE GENTLEMAN, KRISHH and DHOOM, whereas is yet another remake of a South hit with the same title KICK (Telugu) released in 2009. And needless to say has Salman Khan in almost every frame of the film right till its last minute as desired by his die-hard fans who have fondly given him the title of BHAI.\n\nBut having said that, KICK still cannot be rated as anything bad or ridiculous despite having all the above mentioned hiccups in its around 145 minutes of duration. And the reason behind this contradiction is that the film does have a breezy entertaining feel maintained till its impressive climax, has few enjoyable sequences coming in at regular intervals performed well by all the known faces and it holds you on firmly through some superbly written dialogues by Rajat Aroraa.\n\nTo give you a fair idea, KICK has no cheap sequences, objectionable lines or cheeky avoidable humour as seen in many of Salman&apos;s recent films including JAI HO. It doesn&apos;t drag after a while and keeps progressing at a brisk pace, though having all those unwanted songs and sequences adding to its extra length. It doesn&apos;t go into that silly &amp; boring &apos;Love Angle&apos; mode as the latest sequels of KRRISH and DHOOM do. Keeps the much needed fun element intact even till its finale leaving you with all positive vibes. And more importantly this is one of those rare films where Salman Khan doesn&apos;t take off his shirt in any of his last minute fights breaking his own set norm religiously followed in the last few years.\n\nBesides where Salman successfully manages to keep you hooked in the first half along with Randeep Hooda &amp; Jacquelin, there Nawazzudin Siddiqui comes in to provide his big noteworthy support post intermission keeping the energy going. And saying the bitter truth, both Randeep and Nawazuddin frankly can be called the second source of oxygen to this latest Salman Khan movie made on a weak premise. In addition, KICK also gets some valuable strength from its entertaining supporting acts led by Sanjay Mishra in his only scene at the Police Station, Mithun Chakraborty as the spirited father, Saurabh Shukla as the girl&apos;s pa, Archana Puransingh in her one scene playing the loud mother, Kavin Dave-Sumona in the film&apos;s opening chase sequence and Vipin Sharma as the enjoyable, annoyed minister towards the end.\n\nPlus two other thankful saviors of KICK are that this time the lead actress doesn&apos;t tease you at all due to her calm &amp; pleasing appearance (ignoring her diction) and the lead actor i.e. Salman doesn&apos;t look like an arrogant, over confident star performing the role at his own will, ignoring any specific demand of his actual character written in the script. In other words KICK has the Salman Khan we saw in WANTED &amp; DABANGG, but not the one witnessed in READY, BODYGUARD, EK THA TIGER or DABANGG 2 to be precise.\n\nMoreover it&apos;s the unexpectedly surprising debut achievement by the director-producer Sajid Nadiadwala which simply makes you think that why Sajid didn&apos;t opt for direction in all these years for any of Salman&apos;s film, since he has actually managed to deliver a much better product than many renowned directors of the industry, unarguably. Anyway a good start has been made with a bang and I hope he will give us much better films in the future which would ideally be based on some original scripts and not just be the routine remakes of the south following the easier path. Interestingly one fight sequence in its first half has been straight away taken from Prakash Mehra - Amitabh Bachchan&apos;s SHARAABI released in 1984. And I would really like to know that whether it was unintentional or Sajid actually wished to pay a tribute to the master film-maker in his very first venture.\n\nComing back to KICK, cinematography &amp; action gives an international look to the film, especially post intermission in its actions sequences and background score keeps the tempo high as required. Sadly the soundtrack remains the weakest link of the film once again and one or two catchy hit songs could have easily taken the project to another level altogether. Here the point to be noted is that the original Telugu movie does have few melodious upbeat tracks composed well. So I wonder why they didn&apos;t go for the official rights of those songs only, following the ROWDY RATHORE route playing it safe.\n\nNow apart from the commercial aspect, the one thing I would personally like to appreciate here is that since his last two attempts, Salman is trying to give a social message through his films fulfilling his moral responsibility towards the people being their loving celebrity. Unfortunately he failed to give that message impressively in JAI HO but has once again tried to do the same in KICK. And I hope this time the message reaches the maximum, encouraging them all to find their individual KICK of life, before the time is over.\n\nSumming up, I would like to rate KICK as a much better movie than KRRISH 3, DHOOM 3 or even EK THA TIGER in terms of entertainment. So Salman is definitely here to get a bigger Iddi this festive season along with Randeep and Nawazuddin loudly claiming their respective shares too.",

I would not want to run up into them in the dark,or the light for that matter.Jen and Kira are very cute,but I think Kira is a little more interesting than Jen (no,I&apos;m not sexist,I just think that Jen seemed rather emotionless most of the time,but then again,that&apos;s what you get by being raised by emotionless creatures).\n\nNot too many flaws in the film.The story is great,the characters are fantastic,the soundtrack is uplifting,the SFX are more real that anything in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; and the ending.....well,it needed to be a little realistic,and the lengh needed to be a little bit longer,but other than that,we have a near-flawless masterpiece right up here!"

It was one of the funniest movies I&apos;ve seen. I went out and bought it after we returned it. Too many good parts to describe. As you can tell from my screen name, I have a bit of a &apos;thing&apos; for Dave Foley, and I was not disappointed with this movie at all. A guaranteed laugh out loud.

      "reviewBody": "What do I even say? I don&apos;t know. This movie broke my brain. I&apos;m seriously stuck. It&apos;s been two hours and my mind is still racing.\n\nLike the headline, much of what I say may sound negative, but I mean it in the best possible way. This movie is indescribably weird, outlandish, absurd and insane. So many times I thought to myself, &quot;What am I watching?&quot;\n\nThis is dark comedy at it&apos;s finest. It&apos;s so messed up. And I was cracking up. Like everything else in this movie, it takes it to the extreme.\n\nThe directing, cinematography and music work together to fully hypnotize me. It&apos;s so creative and imaginative with so many things I&apos;ve never seen or could possibly imagine.\n\nBeau Is Afraid feels like four movies combined into one. That seems like a terrible idea. But each one is amazing. And they all work together. I don&apos;t understand how he did it. Ari Aster is clearly way smarter than me.\n\nThere are long scenes of dialogue but I was fully glued. And there is usually other stuff going on during those scenes, like something funny in the background or interesting details in the set design. It made me even more engaged as I tried to catch everything.\n\nIn an age where so many movies fail to stand out in any way, Beau Is Afraid stands out in every way. It&apos;s not for the faint of heart. I think some people will hate it. But if you&apos;ve seen Hereditary or Midsommar, you know what you&apos;re in for. It&apos;s very different from them. But just like those movies, it&apos;ll remind you how much a great movie can affect you.\n\n(3 viewings, early screening IMAX 4/18/2023, IMAX 4/26/2023, 4/28/2025)",

From the outset, it seems to rely heavily on exaggerated expressions, over-the-top dialogue, and awkward scenes, which appear more cringe-worthy than impactful. Instead of drawing the viewer in, these elements feel forced, often creating a sense of discomfort rather than entertainment. A significant factor contributing to this is the movie&apos;s average execution, which fails to deliver on the potential of its premise. As it stands, the movie remains a disappointing and lackluster experience, likely to be quickly forgotten by anyone seeking quality storytelling and a well-crafted cinematic journey.",

You just have to be willing to suspend belief and realize what you&apos;re signing up for for the next hour and a half ( let&apos;s be honest, you have to do that with almost every movie). It&apos;s a nonstop shoot &apos;em up, blood everywhere but still not particulalry gory kind of movie.

Checked the writer and director&apos;s past movies doesn&apos;t include it. I wonder at this this because I thought it felt like Little Miss Sunshine at some level before reading the references. It&apos;s a story of a positive minded slightly dysfunctional family who are going through some tough times for bad choices made in the past. The screenplay and conclusion are conventional and made to the writer&apos;s comfort. Emily Blunt has a terrific voice diction, hope to see her in some good animated character. \n\nThe character Oscar is charming and Grampa is the same as in Little Miss Sunshine. Though this movie does not break any ground, I couldn&apos;t find anything that I did not like in it.",

Although its an emotionally charged argument, there&apos;s a rational logic behind it. Every time there&apos;s found footage of killer whale incidents it&apos;s utterly gut-wrenching and you can&apos;t help but dread the moments that inevitably shook the world when they could&apos;ve been prevented. Fortunately, the filmmakers find a different way to present the footage each time and it keeps it from feeling repetitive and builds to feeling more heart breaking at every turn. In its use of talking head interviews with former trainers, it ends up genuinely dramatic without feeling melodramatic as many documentaries can. It oozes with passion for the creatures which helps enforce its argument against their treatment, not just for better protection for trainers, but for corporations like SeaWorld to not turn a blind eye at the clear injustice they&apos;ve cased. What&apos;s the moral cost of the business and entertainment? I certainly won&apos;t ever be able to be entertained by animal acts without thinking about Blackfish. Thisis an extremely powerful documentary that&apos;s brilliantly structured, tragic and cinematic. More than worth your time.\n\n8/10",

      "reviewBody": "There are moments in Spawn that stand out with exceptional creativity, but what truly stands out about the movie is just how much of a mess it is. \n\nThe screenplay is a wreck, the acting is stiff and unconvincing, and the whole thing seems to fly by so fast, that we don&apos;t get a chance to experience much other than a look at some nifty visuals. In fairness, I suppose it is easy enough to argue that Spawn delivers its share of action sequences for a ninety minute movie, but perhaps it needs to back down a bit. It needs more story. In the end, Spawn feels like nothing more or less than an exercise in CGI and make-up effects.\n\nIt is pretty difficult to get involved with the story, in part because it makes no sense, but mostly because we simply do not care. The character of Al Simmons is about as cheap and plastic as the armour he suits up in during the second half of the feature. Quite frankly I don&apos;t find him all that likable. He is cold and nasty, even as a superhero. I really hate it when the good guys talk like the bad guys; when they cackle or make snarly remarks, like Dr. Westlake in the Darkman series. \n\nSome of the special effects work, some don&apos;t. Our hero has a blood red cape which can expand to the size of Texas (don&apos;t ask me how). I liked that effect. The thing sort of has a computer generated life of its own, and its elegance clashes with the plastic of Spawn&apos;s armour. the primary villain is a clown from hell, who can turn into a ten foot armour plated beast which looks a bit like a cousin of the Queen from Aliens. That is another good effect. The climax takes us deep into the fiery pit of hell, which unfortunately does NOT so convincing. My screen saver is a more intimidating computer generated image. I was reminded a bit of the Brinstar level from Super Smash Brothers. \n\nLike so many films do, Spawn ends on a note that just cries out for a sequel. Needless to say, there isn&apos;t one and there never will be. Spawn is entertaining in parts, but definitely not as a whole.",

I wandered in and was blown away. Where can I get the soundtrack?? Holy! Crap!! \n\nSixto is what Dylan could have been. That&apos;s right he&apos;s better than Bob. Better writer, better vocalist by tenfold. Unlike The Jester this guy never sold out and walked the talk until the bitter end. \n\nI&apos;ve always believed the world&apos;s best talent goes unrecognized most of the time but the story of Sixto Rodriguez puts that theory into the &quot;true&quot; category once and for all and I will never doubt it again. Please recognize this man&apos;s work! Hopefully his daughters will continue to work toward that end both in the USA and South Africa.",

      "reviewBody": "The presence of Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin in &quot;Midnight Run&quot; seemed to cause many people to wildly overrate that standard action movie; similarly, the we-hate-Forrest-Gump crowd approached the quietly compelling &quot;Cast Away&quot; with too much prejudice to view it fairly. In &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; (the English-language title of &quot;Le Pacte des loups&quot;), a character says that lies told in Latin can be seen as truth; the fact that this is a commercial film in French (with subtitles so you can fool yourself into feeling clever that you&apos;re watching an art movie) may explain why some are very, very enthusiastic about it. Not that the movie doesn&apos;t deserve praise (it does in a lot of ways); it&apos;s just that I wonder if they&apos;d have been as impressed had it been the identical film shot in English and with an American cast (or with Americans other than Mark Dacascos).\n\nBased on the French tale of a deadly creature that roamed the Gallic countryside in the 18th century and was never caught, &quot;Le Pacte des loups&quot; plays like a better, more coherent, more frightening version of &quot;Sleepy Hollow,&quot; with the representative from the major city (Samuel le Bihan)and his Iroquois Indian blood brother (Dacascos) sent to investigate the gruesome goings-on, and gradually finding out there&apos;s far more than meets the eye - although unlike &quot;Sleepy Hollow,&quot; which went overboard with the decapitations, the murders are kept to a minimum in the early going (we do see the beast attacking two of its female victims (the beast only attacks women and children) in the first half, but most of the details are kept to our imaginations... unlike later on in the movie). The movie takes its time setting the pace and mood, slipping in a few clues to the resolution - one hint: watch out for the gun - and risking losing the audience because it really is pretty methodical; but once all the main characters have been introduced, and once past the halfway point, the movie really starts to deliver.\n\nDirector/co-writer Christophe Gans leaves several narrative threads hanging, but barring a few plot holes this doesn&apos;t damage the movie&apos;s overall effect because so much stuff is woven into it; the tunnel vision of several of the characters, religious symbolism, conspiracy, a hint of incest between a crippled aristocratic hunter (Vincent Cassel) and his sister (Emilie Dequenne) that comes up in a crucial moment of the plot... provided you don&apos;t think it over too much afterwards (for starters, why does the beast not go after men?), or simply think on the movie&apos;s impressive visuals (the first fight scene and several thereafter are in slow motion, but when le Bihan launches an attack on the baddies towards the end - for reasons I won&apos;t divulge here - they come in regular speed; some of the CGI effects are a bit awkward, but the work of Jim Henson&apos;s Creature Shop is thankfully less like the Bloop in &quot;Lost in Space&quot; and more like their usual effective stuff, with a creature guaranteed to give you nightmares), it works just fine.\n\nMention should also be made of the fine score from Joseph LoDuca, no stranger to scoring uncharacteristically zesty historical stories after Hercules and Xena - his cue for our heroes going hunting and the final scene are standouts, although I could have lived without that song over the credits (sung in English, by the way); of the cast&apos;s acting, with special nods to Cassel, Dacascos, and Monica Bellucci as the prostitute who turns out to be more involved with the plot than it appears (if only American actors (and while we&apos;re at it, British ones) were as multilingual as their Continental counterparts); and of the brutal but effective fight scenes, with a particularly impressive climax. While this isn&apos;t the all-timer some say it is (that first hour IS a problem), I enjoyed it in the end; despite its reputation, French cinema has always had its accessible offerings (let&apos;s not forget it gave us &quot;Diva,&quot; Brigitte Bardot, &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; and Luc Besson, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; notwithstanding), and this is further proof.\n\nAs for Monica Bellucci naked - definitely one of the most memorable (and unlike the other ones, decidedly pleasant) moments in the movie, with Gans throwing in an amazing dissolve from Miss Bellucci&apos;s topography to that of the French mountains. For once, Jim Henson&apos;s Creature Shop doesn&apos;t contribute the most impressive bodywork to a film."

The idea seemed to me interesting enough, the music is great, and the cast is excellent, well, I decided to go to this motion picture, hoping to see something new and unusual. I can not say that the film is completely lived up to my expectations.\n\nThink of all the visuals will love movies, because each frame is similar to an independent picture, and it is no exaggeration and sarcasm. The two worlds are quite different, they are difficult to compare, but they are both beautiful in their own way. One world - the sunny metropolis, second - steam punk gloomy town. Honestly, I can say that this film can inspire a fabulous art objects and musical masterpieces.\n\nIn the soundtrack of authorship Audiomachine I fell immediately after watching the trailer. He&apos;s not intrusive, but maintains an atmosphere of the film.\n\nThe first ten minutes of the film the audience tell the universe itself and its rules. All these beautiful drawings and attached personnel. All anything, but this story seems to be dull and boring. Such a beginning influenced by my perception of the story the hero&apos;s life. Therefore tie melodrama seemed to tighten, although the film does not seem boring.\n\nMost of all I &quot;hit&quot; the ending picture. Get the feeling that cut out a epilogue and then leave all the work. In my opinion, the trailer was much more interesting movie, I do not know, perhaps because he was more intrigued audience, or because he was more dynamic. In general, received a quality, beautiful, do not strain your brain melodrama. In general, to rejoice: French film happy ending!",

I do agree that it is predictable, the plot is nothing particularly special and the ending especially doesn&apos;t really hold any surprises. But it is nicely filmed, with evergreen cinematography and pretty scenery and the music is pleasant. The script is good on the most part, there are some humorous parts but it is also somewhat touching, and the director Stephen Herek pitches the humour and melodrama at the right level. And the acting is spirited, with Emilio Estevez charming, dignified and fun as the disgraced lawyer who has to coach the worst ice hockey team and Joss Ackland solid as Hans. Also the ice-hockey scenes are done with just the right amount of flair. Overall, a sweet and fun movie, even with the predictable plot it is worth seeing. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

OK the story is predicable and so was the ending, but I didn&apos;t care. It&apos;s a fun ride that&apos;s not to be taken seriously, so just sit back and enjoy this wonderful comedy.",

It is a raw watch, which touches on the themes of loss, pain, and love.\n\nThe 2024 awards season should look favourably on Andrew Scott&apos;s performance in this film. His portrayal of this mans intriguing, yet sensitive approach of coming to terms with such tragic events in his life could not have been played better by any other actor. An enormous amount of credit must to go Andrew Haigh&apos;s directing and writing, who produced a flawless ensemble to play off of a script where every scene and word was situated perfectly.",

      "reviewBody": "I had been looking forward to True Story since I first saw the trailer in December. And then I read reviews tonight on it and was pretty worried. I actually almost didn&apos;t go to the theater to see it. I almost considered waiting for the DVD (or Digital HD rather, Ha) release. I am glad I didn&apos;t. \n\nI am not going to recap the entire summary of the film, as if you are reading this, chances are you already know it, and if you don&apos;t, the less you know the better. I just finished researching the true story of the film, and it appears this film is quite close to the truth. (Unlike the characters in the film)\n\nThis is a movie about deception involving characters that fabricate the truth to incredible lengths and spin endless webs of lies. One character to a lesser extent to the other, but I found it interesting how this film portrayed the similarities between these two men. The story is brilliantly woven, and extreme attention to detail is paid. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is solid, this is just all around an exceptionally well made film. It&apos;s tragic, yet very thought provoking. \n\nThe main two complaints I heard in critical reviews were that the film lacked suspense, and that it was a whole lot of buildup with no payoff. The no payoff criticism concerned me the most, as I can&apos;t stand movies like that, and that criticism seemed to be the biggest people were making. \n\nRealize going in, this is a psychological drama/thriller. I personally was riveted and in constant psychological suspense, but there isn&apos;t any real physical suspense throughout the film. The suspense comes from a psychological place, falling victim to the constant mind games, and not knowing what the truth really is. \n\nAnd as for the biggest criticism, that there wasn&apos;t any payoff, I couldn&apos;t disagree more. I&apos;d like to ask these critics to their face - how much more payoff are you looking for? Given the details of the true events, there isn&apos;t any more payoff that could have been provided, in fact, I felt the payoff of this film to be big. It was a psychologically riveting experience that provided a lot to think about long after the end credits rolled.",

      "name": "Refreshing and unique rom-com",
      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen a lot of rom-coms over the years, but &apos;The First Time&apos; is unlike any other rom-com I&apos;ve seen before. In fact, I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;d even class it as a rom-com, it&apos;s more of a romantic drama. The central component of the story is the romance between the two main characters, but there isn&apos;t much comedy and certainly no laugh out loud moments. There are quite a lot of emotional scenes and towards the end of the movie, I was shocked at how dark things got for what I initially thought to be a rom-com. \n\nDon&apos;t get me wrong, this movie still has a lot of the same tropes you&apos;d expect from any romantic movie - loner boy meets sweet girl, they hit it off, she has a dumb boyfriend, he has a crush on a popular girl that only sees him as a friend and sleeps around the the jocks, the main pair deny their feelings until they finally admit it, everything&apos;s happy, then the pair inevitably come up against an obstacle before finding their way back to each other. We&apos;ve seen it all before and we know it off by heart, but there is still something very unique about &apos;The First Time&apos;. \n\nWhat makes &apos;The First Time&apos; different than others of this genre is how realistic it is and its focus on the characters Dave (Dylan O&apos;Brien) and Aubrey (Britt Robertson) and their relationship. Although there are other characters and the two main characters interact with those other characters, it&apos;s still completely focused on their budding romance. Dylan and Britt&apos;s chemistry sells the romance and despite a majority of the movie being focused solely on them, I was engrossed. There is something about the way in which the movie is structured and the scenes between the two characters of Dave and Aubrey that feels incredibly intimate and authentic. Their conversations are fully fleshed out and time is spent to really show the process of the two of them getting to know each other. In most movies, it usually feels like there&apos;s a rush to get to the next scene or plot point, but &apos;The First Time&apos; was very character driven, which I enjoyed. The dialogue feels realistic and natural (although, at times is a little melodramatic) and wasn&apos;t saturated with romantic cliches. Dave and Aubrey&apos;s conversations were exactly the kind of conversations people have when they first meet and are getting to know each other. \n\nWhat I most admire about &apos;The First Time&apos; is that it wasn&apos;t afraid to show the rocky road most of us go down when we meet someone new. Although Dave and Aubrey have an initial attraction and chemistry when they meet, the path to them realising that isn&apos;t easy. Towards the end, I was convinced that the two of them wouldn&apos;t find their happy ending and go their separate ways, and I admired that the movie pushed the boundaries of their romance in that way. The main obstacle that stands in their way towards the end is realistic and poignant, and not shallow or constructed. How they feel and what they go through is incredibly relatable and it was refreshing to see a romance movie that isn&apos;t based solely upon fantasy. The relationship feels real and is a reflection of a lot of relationships (particularly first-time relationships) between young people. \n\nIn addition, the exploration of love was just as refreshing. Instead of throwing the word love around or having the characters tell each other (or us) that they loved each other, we got to see the process of them falling in love without a label being put on it. One of my favourite moments is when Dave admits that he has never felt about anyone the way he feels about Aubrey, and that he doesn&apos;t know what those feelings are or what they mean. Love is a complicated emotion, particularly when you&apos;re experiencing it for the first time and I liked that the movie portrayed that sense of uncertainty and confusion that both characters go through as their feelings for one another evolve. \n\nFinally, I love that despite being young and inexperienced, Dave and Aubrey show maturity and resilience in the way they handle the hurdles they face and the message this movie sends to its audience (particularly its younger audience). Unlike most romantic movies, &apos;The First Time&apos; doesn&apos;t provide anyone with unrealistic expectations of love. Dave and Aubrey&apos;s relationship is far from perfect, and the movie could have easily ended with them going their separate ways and never speaking again, and that&apos;s what makes this movie so unique. Its message is that no two people are ever perfect for one another, there&apos;s no straight or easy route to love/relationships and it&apos;s easy to walk away the first time you hit a snag in a relationship, but if you have a unique bond with someone it&apos;s worth fighting for and working on.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed &apos;The First Time&apos; and would recommend it to anyone that&apos;s a fan of romantic movies. Dylan and Britt are great, their chemistry is on point and the love story between Dave and Aubrey isn&apos;t contrived or overly cliche, but organic and realistic. For those looking for a light-hearted or funny rom-com, this won&apos;t be for you, since it is much more emotional than one would expect from a romantic movie. But even then, I still believe this movie is worth a watch if only to put a slight dent in the over-the-top and cliched romantic fantasies present in the romance genre.",

      "name": "Worthy sequel!",
      "reviewBody": "2 years after the surprising success of &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;, Victor Salva returns with a sequel that continues where the original left. Although at first reluctant to making a sequel, Salva crafts a competent horror film that continues exploring the formula of the supernatural hunter in the desolated rural setting. Despite having the obvious flaws of a minor sequel, &quot;Jeepers Creepers II&quot; is a worthy follow up that has its own share of tricks to keep the fans happy.\n\nThe plot of the film follows a school bus of a local high school that just won the championship and are on their way back home. To their misfortune, the Creeper (Jonathan Breck) is one the loose as he is on the final day of his 23 days eating cycle, so this ruthless hunter will do whatever is necessary to find food before his time runs out. But the Creeper has another problem, he is being hunted down by Jack Taggart (Ray Wise) the father of one of his victims who is looking for revenge.\n\nWhile it lacks the originality of the first one, &quot;Jeepers creepers II&quot; has a more focused and consistent plot due to the fact that the Creeper is now an identifiable villain. Victor Salva&apos;s new tale of rural horror is now a full-fledged supernatural horror in the vein of Wes Craven&apos;s &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, where typical elements of Americana become sources of horror. Having most of the movie set inside of the school bus with the cast&apos;s fears and personalities clashing makes a good source for classic suspense and tension between characters.\n\nVisually, the film is a step forward and showcases that deep down the obvious commercial intentions of this film, Salva is still an artist that has a great eye for visual compositions. His camera-work does miracles both in and out of the school bus (the movie&apos;s main location) and he captures the lovely and scary things about rural North America. The visual effects of the film are not as good as in the first one, but they are still effective and the CGI is not that dominant.\n\nThe young cast does a fine job and the overall performance is not as poor as one could expect. However, they are nothing spectacular and some seem to had been chosen based more on looks rather than talent. The two veterans of the movie are where talent is. Jonathan Breck and Ray Wise give the film soul as the opposite forces who are destined to clash. Breck is quite good as the Creeper and looks more comfortable in the role now; Wise on the other hand, is a scene stealer and he owns the film every time he is on screen.\n\n&quot;Jeepers Creepers II&quot; has a lot of what&apos;s good about modern horror movies, but sadly, it carries also some of the worst. The fast packed action at times gets distracting and contrasts badly with Salva&apos;s honest attempts to create suspense and atmosphere. There is an apparent effort in developing characters and while in some cases it works, in others it terribly fails (due mostly to the actor&apos;s lack of talent). also, it is fair to point out that the movie lacks the scares of the first one as it has more in common with the final part of it. It is great fun and entertainment, but if scares are what you are looking, better look elsewhere.\n\nTo summarize, the film is an entertaining and very well-directed scary movie that makes a worthy sequel to the original one. Victor Salva&apos;s second part of the series is a good addition if you liked the first one, otherwise it will be just another teen horror movie. Personally I liked it, but it would be wiser to rent it first. 6.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) is retiring. While in his farewell party, his colleagues are informed that an eight years old girl has been raped and murdered. Jerry decides to go to the crime scene with his colleagues. There, they realized that the child parents have not been informed about the crime, and Jerry goes to their home to give them the bad news. The child&apos;s mother Margaret Larsen (Patricia Clarkson) challenges him to promise that he would catch the criminal. The fulfillment of this promise becomes an obsession to Jerry. A tragic and dark end finishes his haunting. This thriller is really great, having a excellent director, cast and screenplay. The end of the story is not for all tastes, but I liked it a lot. Fortunately this film was not produced by a big Hollywood producer, otherwise the end of the story would be commercial and the film would lose its impact. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): `A Promessa&apos; (`The Promise&apos;)",

      "reviewBody": "Novocaine is a fast-paced action-comedy that delivers a huge dose of fun, as long as you don&apos;t take it too seriously. It&apos;s built on a genuinely original premise: the main character has congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP), a real and rare genetic disorder that prevents him from feeling any physical pain.\n\nThis setup gives the film a fantastic opportunity for some pretty gruesome and innovative action sequences, so it&apos;s certainly not for the faint-hearted. It&apos;s the kind of role that feels tailor-made for Jack Quaid, who perfectly captures the chaotic energy of the character.\n\nThere&apos;s nothing too deep to think about here. This is a film that asks you to suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride. With good production values and a plot that moves too quickly to get bogged down in any script absurdities (of which there are probably many), it&apos;s easy to do just that.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed it. If you&apos;re looking for a wild, funny, and creative action flick and are happy to check your brain at the door, Novocaine is a great choice.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; is by far the finest film I&apos;ve seen this year, and probably the best I&apos;ve seen since the dial turned from the 1990&apos;s into the new millennium.\n\nVadim Perelman makes a movie so astoundingly beautiful that one has to think he&apos;s been doing this for years, but this is his first film.  Set in a fog-drenched Southern California community, Perelman sets two immoveable forces apart from each other -- Cathy, a recovering alcoholic burdened by the memory of her late father, still trying to prove that she is a responsible person in his eyes, and Behrani, a colonel driven out of Iran with his family and desperately trying to maintain a life of stability and promise.  In these two roles, Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley give steely performances, each presenting troubled souls trapped within stubborn facades.  Connelly once again gives a masterful performance, balancing a reckless sensuality with the desire to find acceptance and love within anything, even a house where the memories have become so painful that the mail becomes too much to take.\n\nKingsley, of course, is perfect.  The subtleties of his facial expressions when presented with moments of joy and frustration are masterfully restrained.  This is his best performance of his illustrious career.\n\nWhen Kingsley and Connelly finally clash, halfway through the movie, the movie, having until then been a paean to silence and unspoken loyalties, becomes a terrifying thriller, riveting everyone with whom I saw the picture.  Perelman moves from a mood piece to a suspenseful drama effortlessly.  A jaw-dropping conclusion completes a powerful, unbelievably sad piece of work.\n\nAfter a couple years of not finding a movie that stirred me, this is it, what we all look for in movies -- a harrowing story, beautifully filmed, cathartic and elegant.  Joy is very difficult to spot in the film, but &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; provides the joy we get when being moved to powerful emotions by a wonderful symphony.\n\nMy best film of 2003 -- unquestionably 10/10.",

Well, because I wasn&apos;t sure what I was getting into here, aside from it being an animated movie that my son wanted to watch. But with it being an animated movie that I hadn&apos;t already seen, of course I opted to watch it with my son.\n\nI will say that writers Etan Cohen, Yoni Brenner and Hilary Winston actually put together a good storyline. Now, I am not familiar with the books that the movie is based on, so how true it is to the source material, I cannot tell you. But I found the storyline in &quot;The Bad Guys&quot; to actually be well-written and enjoyable, as well as being entertaining.\n\nThe character gallery is what worked so well for me here. I really took a liking to the characters in the story right away, and they are as colorful as they are memorable. Not only did they manage to paint a gallery of interesting characters, but they definitely also had a great voice acting cast ensemble to bring the characters to life.\n\nThe animation and art style used in director Pierre Perifel&apos;s 2022 animated movie &quot;The Bad Guys&quot; was good. I liked the drawing and art style quite a lot, as it was very dynamic, and had a slight comic book feel to it.\n\nThe voice cast in &quot;The Bad Guys&quot; was nicely cast with some great voice actors on the cast list, with the likes of Awkwafina, Sam Rockwell, Marc Maron, Craig Robinson, Anthony Ramos and more.\n\nIf you enjoy animted movies, then you certainly should sit down to watch &quot;The Bad Guys&quot;. I was genuinely entertained by this animated movie, and it one that I will warmly recommend.\n\nMy rating of &quot;The Bad Guys&quot; lands on a seven out of ten stars.",

      "reviewBody": "`Pig in a Poke&apos; is the newest game show in the US. Families dress up in pig costumes and answer questions. At the end, they can be pigs and win a great prize. And who&apos;s starring on it? Why, none other than our favorite family the Griswalds (spelled differently in this one than the others)! After a close competition with resident champions the Froegers, they win a European vacation. Audrey (Dana Hill) doesn&apos;t want to leave behind her boyfriend Jack (William Zabka), and Rusty (Jason Lively) just doesn&apos;t want to go. They do, reluctantly, but this two week vacation doesn&apos;t go without a hitch.\n\n2nd released in the series, and usually considered least of the series, which I go with. Simply, it&apos;s not as funny as the others: Vacation, Christmas Vacation, and Vegas Vacation. It tries to be more raucous and irreverent than the others. It doesn&apos;t have a central grasp on any one plot. They go across Europe, but there&apos;s nothing that connects all of the destinations. For instance, in Vacation there was Aunt Edna; Christmas Vacation, it actually had a real plot, and in Vegas Vacation there were a few subplots, but they all went through.\n\nAll that isn&apos;t to say that it wasn&apos;t funny, it&apos;s just not as funny as the other three. As heard from Chevy Chase on the subpar DVD commentary, he wishes to do another Vacation movie. I would like to see that. Many of the laughs came from slapstick and pratfalls, which aren&apos;t my favorite types of humor. Some of them were predictable (they go to Stonehengeguess what?), but some of the gags (like on the train to Rome) were nice.\n\nThe MPAA wrongly gave this movie its PG-13 rating. It most definitely should have been rated R. The writers, which include veteran John Hughes, must have tried to keep the humor in the PG-13 range, because they didn&apos;t `rough it up&apos; as much as they wanted to.\n\nOne last thought: if there was an earlier movie version of Chicago, Beverly D&apos;Angelo would have been perfect as Roxie.\n\nMy rating: 6/10\n\nRated PG-13 for sustained scenes of nudity, sexual situations, teen drinking and language.",

      "reviewBody": "Lars von Trier&apos;s Breaking the Waves is the kind of film that makes me proud to be a film-goer and exceeds anything I could have possibly expected from the man who made Element of Crime. That film had some clever experimentation (and so does this one) but this film is the kind that&apos;s beauty and power echoes in your mind hours after you&apos;ve watched it. This is a flabbergasting work of art that portrays a woman&apos;s quest to please God and does so with the complexity and emotional power of a Bergman film (not to mention the fact that the film portrays a woman&apos;s intense suffering in world sternly ruled by men with the power of a Dreyer film). If von Trier made nothing else of any merit for the rest of his career, if all he did was make marginally interesting film experiments, I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to call him a great filmmaker on the soul basis of this film. Anyway, you get the picture The film stars Emily Watson as Bess, a shy and neurotic girl who is filled with joy to be with her new husband Jan (Stellan Skarsgard who is exceptional). When Jan is paralyzed after an accident at the oilrig he works in, he is in danger of losing his life. He convinces Bess to see other people and Bess wants nothing more than to make him happy and to prove to God that she loves him. After some disastrous complications, Bess is led to believe that she can please God and save Jan&apos;s life by having numerous sexual encounters with strangers in town. This sounds like a grungy tale, but von Trier tells it with such humanism and focus on his themes that we never feel like he is rubbing our faces in drear. And Watson is delightful, frightening, and heartbreaking as a woman who will stop at nothing to please those around her. Her one-sided conversations with God (in which she looks up in the air submissively and pleas and then looks down with a deep voice of wrath and scolds) are both funny and sad, not to mention the fact that they reveal seemingly endless amounts of details about who she is. The film is made with a hand-held camera and a visually stunning solarized style. This style does not make the movie; it just adds richness to each scene in the way it gives each face such shadowy texture. In the end, von Trier seems to believe in God but does not believe in the churches that try to codify what he wants. All of this works because of von Trier&apos;s passionate desire to understand how one can please God under horrendous terms; the epilogue, that takes the already-great material to a new level and shows how inspired von Trier is, starts with a moment of sad irony and then leaps to the skies with an image that fills the most atheistic person with questions and the more religiously spiritual people with hope. Here is a film that reaches for the stars and makes it there."

It opened my eyes to a very thought provoking element of Chinese culture and was full of poignancy, humour, and heart.\n\nWe follow a family grappling with grief and the way that the film deals with this is so unique and engaging. All of the characters had a part to play in contributing to the story and adding to the film, but the central relationship is between Awkwafina&apos;s Billi and her grandmother. It&apos;s a very human, believable, and relatable relationship which drives the film and injects so much heart and emotion. It was beautiful to watch.\n\nThe screenplay is quite minimal, with not a huge amount of dialogue, but it doesn&apos;t need it. It manages to convey its meaning and purpose through other mediums, and is highly accomplished in this way.\n\nI also loved the direction and cinematography of The Farewell. It felt very clean, very arty, and was just great to look at.\n\nA very powerful film exploring familial love and grief in a sensitive, unique, and tender way.",

      "reviewBody": "My wife and I caught Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline introduces a new villain, a chameleon with shape-shifting abilities, aiming to take over the world. The chameleon seeks to use the staff Po received in Kung Fu Panda 3 to open a gateway to another dimension, summon kung fu masters, and steal their powers to become unstoppable. Simultaneously, Po must find his replacement to train as the next Dragon Warrior. Can Po save the world and find his apprentice simultaneously?\n\nCo-directed by Mike Mitchell (Trolls) and Stephanie Stine (Major Motion Picture debut), the film features the voices of Jack Black (School of Rock), Viola Davis (The Help), Awkwafina (Crazy, Rich, Asians), Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie), James Hong (Big Trouble in Little China), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), and Ke Huy Quan (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).\n\nThe animation, animal universe, and the introduction of the new villain were excellent, as always. Viola Davis was a great addition, but Awkwafina&apos;s presence felt awkward and annoying. The absence of the Furious Five was noticeable, and the two-father subplot was just okay. The film strikes a good balance between lessons and comedy, and kept us laughing throughout. While the ending was rewarding, it didn&apos;t quite match the brilliance of previous films in the series.\n\nIn conclusion, Kung Fu Panda 4 offers a fun, above-average animated experience but stands as the weakest link in the series. I&apos;d score it a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.",

You get the same sort of comments with movies like Tim Burton&apos;s wonderful Big Fish or Spielberg&apos;s Terminal. I will admit that the Dunst character is a cliché, but this movie is really about the extras, the characters that step out of the background, have their moment, and step back again. Paula Dean stands out as a woman to whom family -- *all* her family -- is all-important and who keeps it together with food and photographs. I&apos;m not from Kentucky or the South, although I&apos;ve lived South for a number of years. I&apos;m not that interested in *my* extended family -- and in that respect I&apos;m far closer to the Bloom character than to the Dean character. But I recognize that this film is a great portrait of a certain kind of family life. Also, the dead father becomes a very well-rounded character indeed, as you think about the contradictions of his life. This is a film that expects the audience to do a little work, and it pays very well for that work.",

      "reviewBody": "The &apos;rebirth&apos; of Turkish cinema is rejoiced with perhaps one of the finest movies to ever appear in Turkey.  It appears the sudden pause of the Turkish cinema due to the lacking quality against the western movie market has resumed, transforming yesilcam and its unique and familiar style into something that is more recognizable by the &apos;new generation&apos;.  Movies like Kahbe Bizans, Abuzer Kadayif, Eskiya, and TV series like Ikinci Bahar and Yilan Hikayesi are some of the finest examples of this.  Yet these are far more than simple replications of the western styles, these contain an element of the Turkish culture and people that we are so used to seeing. This is the essence of the brilliance beneath Eskiya.  The way it accurately reflects our troubles and the way we deal with them.\n\nBeginning with the first scene, we become aware of the how incredibly well written the script is and the realism and truthfulness beneath the characters.  This realism in fact is drawn to such a scale that at no poin t in the movie, do we feel anger at any character, or identify one as evil; merely the victims of the horrible system in which we live in, and the incidents we read in the papers everyday.  While national problems such as migration, organized crime, and poverty are all central themes to the movie, so are human emotions like betrayal and revenge.  Even the bizarre ending filled with numerous deaths appears very natural.\n\nThe acting also is quite remarkable.  Sener Sen, being a great actor, portrays Baran superbly, while Ugur Yucel with his unquestionable talent does his part and every other role is cast with incredible thought and consideration.  The climax I thought shows this  the best, Sener Sens monologue on the rooftop scene had tears coming out of my eyes.\n\nOverall, it would be very unjust to say that this is the greatest Turkish movie to be ever filmed because, being a kid of the new generation, I would simply be completely blocking out 50+ years of yesilcam.  However with it&apos;s great script, the warmth we feel towards the characters, and the amazing performances by the actors,  this is one of the best and it most certainly is a symbol of the rebirth of Turkish cinema.  If you are Turkish and haven&apos;t seen or heard about this movie, you probably slept through the last 5 years go see it now! And if you&apos;re not Turkish, you should still see it.  I recommend it to anyone."

The movie has a great storyline and the more you see you more you are involved within and you have to see the ending. I won;t comment much on the story. You have to see it to believe it. But i will say that it is not to be missed. and trust me you will think twice travelling in subway at midnight after watching this great piece of horror genre.",

      "name": "Another Great Film of Its Genre",
      "reviewBody": "A stud line-up produces a solid modern western in a time when the genre has certainly lived way passed its prime. Never really dead, The Western, proves time and time again that even with its typical tropes, run-of-the-mill grizzled outlaws, and the learned sheepish &quot;city&quot; man that set out to settle for a better life; to risk all they knew to find the dream, that the genre still has something to give us.\n\nThe Sisters Brothers gives us a character study that focuses on the fraternity of brotherhood, and in this case, a very close look at a twisted one that at its core finds the fundamental values of what it means to be a brother. We have all seen Joaquin Phoenix play this type before; reckless and obstreperous, while we find Jake Gyllenhaal and Riz Ahmed sharing screen time (again). But this is truly John C. Reilly&apos;s movie, who at first, is certainly overlooked and shown to us as the &quot;lesser&quot; brother. As we come to find out the truth we see the foils of Reilly&apos;s and Phoenix&apos;s character come full circle; ultimately seeing how their past has affected them. We notice (indirectly) how father figures are important role models, and to some extent we even get a taste of the affect mothers have on their kids as well as we see traits of either parent in both brothers as they film goes on. Reilly gets his iconic moment and really the final statement of how far he will go to protect his brother when the time comes, and it is awesome. Certainly the highlight of the entire film for me.\n\nAt times slow, the film has moments of wittiness and subtle humor that remains fresh throughout. The Sisters Brothers is definitely worth seeing as it makes its statement as a film of its genre with great performances, especially from Reilly.",

      "reviewBody": "Based on Yasutaka Tsutsui&apos;s 1967 novel, - which has been adapted several times over the years, including 1983&apos;s The Little Girl Who Conquered Time - The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a charming mix of drama and romantic comedy, with a slight infusion of science fiction ideas. Makoto (Riisa Naka) is a high school girl who, through serendipity, gains the ability to leap back in time (but she only manages moments or hours back). She has platonic relationships with two high school boys, Chiaki (Takuya Ishida) and Kousuke (Mitsutaka Itakura), and they spend their time playing baseball.\n\nWith her new-found abilities, she does nothing spectacularly profound, and the films intentions aren&apos;t to comment on paradoxes or to shift the space-time continuum as is usually the case with time travel narratives. Makoto uses her abilities to repeat events that pleasure her, to ace a school test, and also to avoid certain embarrassing situations with her friends. But as her relationships with, particularly, Chiaki and Kousuke, her leaps become more personally profound, as she attempts to possibly save the people she cares for (within the context of small human moments of danger, and not the usual global/country catastrophes.\n\nI love the fact that in Japan, they do not distinguish between live- action cinema and animated (anime if you like) films, they are all simply movies. Now I&apos;m going to contradict this with a Western perspective: This beautifully animated film is a delight to view, with its traditional two-dimensions, it is evidence to the west that 3D, computer generated animation is not the overbearing format, and 2D is still a genuinely viable medium. The film is filled with charming human moments, both touching and thoughtful. Teenage comedies rarely have this level of tenderness of character, that also explores concepts of fate, the passage of time and the intricacies of small human moments, and the delicate nature of human relationships.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

In fact, I was even less impressed when I assumed it was just another run-of-the-mill spy thriller about agents hell-bent on destabilising Moscow.\n\nBoyyyyy, was I wrong.\n\nThis film is an absolute class act - an intelligent, gripping espionage drama that had me hooked from start to finish. Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender deliver powerhouse performances, balancing raw intensity with the kind of nuance that elevates the film beyond your standard spy fare. Their chemistry is electric, and every moment between them crackles with tension.\n\nThe supporting cast is just as strong, with Naomie Harris, Regé-Jean Page, and Pierce Brosnan adding layers of intrigue and depth. The dialogue is razor-sharp, and the script is packed with twists and turns that never feel forced - just expertly crafted storytelling at its finest.\n\nSteven Soderbergh is in his element here, blending sleek cinematography with a tight, sophisticated narrative. It&apos;s stylish, smart, and effortlessly cool. If you think you know what to expect from Black Bag, think again. This is espionage cinema at its absolute best.",

      "reviewBody": "Sexy Beast is a funny and highly enjoyable crime movie punctuated by some blood curdling violence.  The film was directed by Jonathen Glazer, who was responsible for most of the recent amazing Guinness beer adverts.\n\nRay Winstone is Gal, a retired criminal enjoying retirement in Spain with friends and the woman he loves.  But this is shattered by the arrival of a menacing figure from his past in the shape of pyschotic Don Logan (played with evil intensity by Ben Kingsley).  Don wants Gal for one last spectacular job and will do just about anything to get him, including threatening Gal&apos;s beloved wife.\n\nThe story is told at a fast pace, with several surreal interludes but never loses momentum.  Ray Winstone puts in another loveable badboy performance that he does so well, but the film is dominated by Kingsley who steals every scene he is in and creates one of the most menacing screen villains in recent memory.  The brilliance of the film is that it manages to combine so many disparate elements (thriller, comedy, and a touching love story to say the least) into a cohesive and highly entertaining whole.  A real pleasure to watch and a striking, brilliant debut."

      "reviewBody": "Drive My Car, nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best International Feature Film, and Best Adapted Screenplay at the 94th Academy Awards, is a critically acclaimed Japanese melodrama. The story revolves around four key characters. Protagonist Kafuku Yusuke is a renowned actor and theater director with a calm and quiet demeanor who is shocked to discover that his wife has a sexual relationship with a much younger man. His wife Oto is a creative and expressive mind who conceives ideas for her screenwriting while and after having sex. Young actor Takatsuki Koji seems to have a self-confident swagger but starts questioning his whole existence after a relationship with a minor destroys his career and leads to excessive media coverage. Watari Misaki is a young woman who suffered mental and physical abuse from her unstable mother in Hokkaido and started a new life as driver in Hiroshima. This movie explores the relationships between some of these characters and deals with overcoming challenges in general and processing loss in particular.\n\nThis movie convinces on several levels. First and foremost, the aforementioned characters are authentic, detailed and profound. Viewers will discover more about them with every single scene and care about their fates. Especially their flaws make it easy to empathize or even sympathize with them.\n\nThe acting performances are also very convincing. Especially the actresses truly deliver the goods. Kirishima Reika shines in the opening of the movie as free-spirited, imaginative and mysterious screenwriter. The very best performance might however come from Miura Toko as skilled driver in an identity crisis who doesn&apos;t speak much thoughout the film but transmits many emotions through precise body language in general and subtle facial expressions in particular.\n\nDrive My Car is filled with many artistic, intellectual and philosophical references. This goes along with the artistic, creative and expressive characters. Samuel Beckett&apos;s Waiting for Godot is particularly referenced in the beginning while Anton Chekhov&apos;s Uncle Vanya receives much attention through the movie&apos;s middle section and ending. It also is no coincidence that the movie&apos;s setting shifts from downtown Tokyo to Hiroshima and its rural surroundings. Attentive viewers will also realize that the closing scene takes place in South Korea. These numerous subtle elements are complemented by an elegant soundtrack featuring classical music and the use of a red Sab 900 that represents individualism and nostalgia in a time of colletivism and change. This movie offers much to discover for an intellectual audience and is worth being viewed on several occasions to discover new facets.\n\nThe film is however not without its flaws. The running time of three hours includes a few minor lengths here and there. Especially the introduction that takes more than forty minutes before the opening credits appear could have been shortened a little bit. Some of the theater play practises and sequences also overstay their welcome and can at times be somewhat pretentious with passages featuring numerous foreign languages from Korean sign language to Taiwanese Mandarin.\n\nAt the end of the day, Drive My Car is a melodrama with emotional depth and intellectual details. This timeless film should please anyone looking for profound dramas built upon authentic characters. Patient viewers will be rewarded with a story that resonates long after the movie has ended.",

I&apos;m usually a fan of clever reference, but in Be Cool they mostly fell flat. This movie had four music numbers, a dance sequence, and a montage. It was less a whole film, and more a meaningless parade of cameos. The writing was pretty bad, and most of the performances were desperate and awkward-notably Steven Tyler. Duane Johnson stood out in a movie full of celebrities, as he obviously had a really good time acting, and he was fun to watch. All told, I would have a hard time recommending this film.",

How many people have asked the question after having an accident or chanced upon something, &quot;If I had only left a minute later, none of this would have happened.&quot; Now we get into the who time continuum thing and parallel universes. I know this isn&apos;t a science fiction film, although a Twilight Zone episode may have fun with this plot. When we are dealing with the characters colliding through the fourth dimension, a whole different set of circumstances are put in motion. The reason we can never travel back in time (while forward is possible) is that time would then become mutable and what we are may no longer be and then we wouldn&apos;t travel back in time. Two roads diverge in a woods paraphrasing Robert Frost, but what if we could take each of those roads and see what happens. This movie is quite magical and does the best it can to get Gwyneth Paltrow through her parallel universes and see the things that one would see. I think the problem is that unless we get into quantum physics, it&apos;s hard for the average person to really reconcile these sorts of events. I thought the acting was very good and believe things as they unfurled. I would recommend this film if you like to think about the possibilities it envisions. Try it on yourself sometime and extrapolate your own existence from some fork in the road and imagine what may have been.",

This is a goofy comedy in which you must suspend disbelief continuously. That is all it was meant to be. It&apos;s just a babysitting movie, get it? Like all the rest, only it tries to bring a little freshness to the table ...and in my opinion, it does. \n\nIt showcases Jonah Hill&apos;s amazing comedic talents, and we get to see some really good performances by some child actors too. Yes, it&apos;s Hill&apos;s signature shtick, but look closely and you&apos;ll see incredible timing and a guy who is extremely capable of carrying a movie. There are some good jokes written into it, but the film completely relies on the performances, and I doubt anyone associated with it would disagree (well, let&apos;s hope they wouldn&apos;t).\n\nIn my opinion, most of the comedy works the way it was supposed to, and the few half-way serious moments do too. In terms of its edginess, it seems to up the ante on the simple formula flick that it is. It&apos;s safe to say that if it suits your sense of humor and you&apos;re willing to go for the ride, you&apos;ll have a good time. I wish people would quit over-analyzing movies like this.

I must admit, some of them work, some of them don&apos;t. Cloverfield worked for me, but only on the big screen in a cinema. Blair Witch worked for me, but only on a small PC monitor. Some things work better depending on the way you view these things, but also, what works with one person, will not work with another, everybody is different.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me honestly try to convince you that my small review on this film is mainly based on its merits, and not just what I enjoy personally.\n\nI think the credit is due to the effort that went behind making this film, because even though each of the video tapes the guys find and watch are very strange and hard to swallow, they have genuinely tried hard to convey a sense of realism. \n\nBut it also helps if the viewer made a little effort, and suspended your disbelief in order to get into the film. Some people can do this easier than others. If your a horror fan, this will entertain at the very least. Each of the five found tapes start off innocently enough like home movies, but each one reveals shocking footage of something strange or unravels into a horrifying ordeal. It reminded me of &apos;Tales of the unexpected&apos; or &apos;The Twilight Zone&apos; but with the use of a hand-held camera instead.\n\nAgain, it&apos;ll either work for you or it wont. But the makers of this film tried hard and kudos to them. The effects were great, the acting was as expected, just as in any &apos;found footage&apos;, if its going to convey realism, its NOT going to have Oscar worthy acting, don&apos;t forget these are meant to be &apos;real&apos; people. And the stories behind each tape were all entertaining.\n\nIn the end then, before you watch it, heres some top tips; Turn the lights out. Keep telling yourself that what you are watching is &apos;real&apos;. Open your mind. And enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "THE DEVIL&apos;S BACKBONE (El Espinazo del Diablo) \n\nAspect ratio: 1.85:1\n\nSound format: Dolby Digital\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, a young orphan boy (Fernando Tielve) is sent to an isolated boarding school where he encounters the ghost of a murdered child (Junio Valverde) who warns him of impending disaster...\n\nA masterpiece. Filmed in Spain by writer-director Guillermo del Toro following his unhappy Hollywood debut (MIMIC), this spellbinding melodrama works both as an examination of the political turmoil which characterized the Spanish Civil War, and as a simple ghost story in which a tragic spirit seeks vengeance for a terrible crime. Employing restless camera-work and atmospheric set designs to their best advantage, del Toro visualizes his own script (co-written with Antonio Trashorras and David Muñoz) as the story of a vulnerable child cast adrift in a strange new world, where he must contend not only with everyday problems (such as the school bully, Ínigo Garcés, whose motives are rather more complex than they first appear), but also his frequent encounters with the unhappy ghost, some of which are genuinely unsettling (watch out for the heart-stopping sequence in which Tielve is besieged in a closet by the enraged phantom).\n\nProduction values are first-class throughout, ranging from César Macarrón&apos;s evocative art direction and Salvador Mayolas&apos; ultra-creepy sound design, through to Luis de la Madrid&apos;s crisp editing skills and Javier Navarrete&apos;s unforgettable music score. Visual effects and makeup designs are also superb, though deliberately underplayed for maximum emotional effect. The cast is toplined by Spanish movie veterans Marisa Paredes (a favorite of Pedro Almodóvar) and Federico Luppi (CRONOS), and there are impressive turns by Irene Visedo as a young woman whose loyalties are divided by circumstances, and rising star Eduardo Noriega (the Spanish equivalent of Brad Pitt) as Visedo&apos;s boyfriend, an orphan-turned-caretaker whose volatile nature leads to a dramatic conclusion, with appalling consequences for everyone around him. Tielve is magnificent as the wide-eyed innocent at the center of the narrative, and Garcés is every bit his equal as the bully who reclaims his dignity during a climactic showdown with the forces of evil. Released around the same time as THE OTHERS (2001) - another Spanish ghost story, filmed in English as a vehicle for Nicole Kidman - THE DEVIL&apos;S BACKBONE was consigned to Art-house distribution by virtue of its status as a subtitled movie and suffered a comparative loss at the US box-office, though del Toro&apos;s magical fever dream is unquestionably the better of the two films.\n\n(Spanish dialogue)",

It is French and luckily, they are allowed to have an alternate path to interesting movie making.\n\nThis guy Jeunet puts a LOT into all of his productions. Almost a mentally overwhelming amount of style, info and actions (not action packed, but activities that go on in or behind the scene). He also did Amelie which is just as astounding and one of the best films ever made. Watch it start to finish if you don&apos;t believe that.\n\nThe City of Lost Childen extends its name sake across many peoples from the twisted characters that are adults and act like the children they never were, to the children who are lost from being children and must be adults. Not to mention the abductions and the reason for that. \n\nSo it is a win on many levels. One of the best, and I am so grateful I happened across this bazaar gem of a flick.\n\nWish more movies were as intricately entertaining as this art piece is.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that I&apos;ve spent in a very, very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies you&apos;d probably say, that&apos;s hard to imagine, but never-the-less, it&apos;s true! After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew that I had to see it! If you&apos;re a fan of horror, mystery, and suspense, why wouldn&apos;t you? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting; unfortunately, the movie is none of these.\n\nFrom the cinematography, to the script, to the acting, this movie is a complete flop. If you&apos;re reading this, planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills, mystery, action, horror, or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes I&apos;m afraid you are in for disappointment.\n\n&quot;Why is it so bad,&quot; you might be asking yourself. Let me tell you. The movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful. Nothing about the movie made me the least bit &quot;on edge,&quot; frightened, or curious. The script was at best laughable. There were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous I began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn&apos;t. The acting was absolutely dreadful. I like Nicholas Cage but this was a miss. Without exception, every performance in this movie was incredibly below average. The cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away.\n\nI am not usually a very harsh critic. Frankly, when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery/suspense/horror, I just want to be surprised. This movie was boring, poorly acted, poorly written, and an overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.",

Is it Costner? Is that it? Because they roundly hated &quot;3000 Miles To Graceland&quot; too, another fun movie which may not be Oscar worthy, but nevertheless. And there are definitely some Costner duds out there (Waterworld, The Postman), but I can tell you this, I would watch &quot;Criminal&quot; 100 times before I&apos;d ever force myself to watch &quot;Nomadland&quot; again!",

      "reviewBody": "This film is quite well known for being made on a $7000 budget, and while that can be quite impressive... Parts of this film are far from it. But that doesn&apos;t meant this is a bad film. Not at all.\n\nFirst I want to cover the more amateur feeling parts of this film that bring it down. The acting can be pretty iffy at times, sometimes coming across as quite terrible. The camera work can be a bit shoddy at times as well, with certain shots containing random camera shaking that just seems to be an error rather then stylistic choice. Audio can be strange and distracting too, generally due to the fact that the film was shot silent and then the audio was recorded on set with a cheap recording device and synced later. Also, the story is pretty cheesy and is full of little plot holes that if you&apos;re paying attention will make you go &quot;wait...what?&quot;.\n\nThese cons do not completely take away from the pros however. I think there&apos;s a lot to be respected about this film, due to how cheap it was made. There are occasionally shots that are quote impressive and well thought out. While the story is kinda cheesy, it does get you interested when things start to heat up. There&apos;s almost a kind of fun aspect to the film where you see certain things and wonder to yourself how they were done on such a cheap budget. \n\nIt&apos;s a great first film and is an interesting film for people who want to create their own, due to the fact that it was created so cheap and creatively. It&apos;s an example of how you can start off small, but become big.",

The film's darker tone and thrilling action scenes are often praised for refreshing the superhero genre. However, critiques frequently point to script issues, such as rushed plot points and underdeveloped characters, alongside an inconsistent tone. The CGI effects and villains, especially Rhino, are often deemed disappointing. Despite these shortcomings, many find the movie enjoyable, though it doesn't quite excel in the superhero landscape.",

I was surprised that Kraven wasn&apos;t the only enhanced human (Rhino, Foreigner), but it just made it a bit more interesting.\n\nI am bothered by how many people denigrated Ariana Debose, who was fine with what she was given. Fred Hechinger (who was also on Gladiator II) was decent as the brother.\n\nWas it perfect? Heck no. But it was much better than I expected! It is a fun movie to see, better than many out there.

      "reviewBody": "From the late 1980&apos;s into the 1990&apos;s, Paul Veerhoven was one of the biggest names working behind the camera in Hollywood. Starting with 1987&apos;s Robocop and continuing through Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers, Veerhoven mastered the sex and violence ties that brought audiences out to his films in droves.\n\nBut 1995&apos;s Showgirls ended his run of good fortune. Considered by most to be one of the worst films of the 90&apos;s (it&apos;s not), Showgirls all but put Veerhoven in Guantanamo Hollywood prison. And since 2000, Veerhoven has directed but three films – Hollow Man, Black Book and Tricked.\n\nWith any fortune, Veerhoven will no longer take such a long sabbatical after his latest effort, Elle which was nominated for the Palme D&apos;Or at Cannes and had its North American Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival this past Friday.\n\nElle stars Isabelle Huppert as Michele, a corporate CEO of a small video-game design company who deals with the emotional effects of a rape that occurs before the screen even fades in with the open scene. When audiences do get more than the horrifying audio of the assault, we view Michele as she fights with a masked intruder on the floor of her home. Beaten and raped, Michele cleans up and continues with her life. A prior bad history with the police leaves her not wanting to report the crime and stoically she marches on with the rape but a blip on life&apos;s resume.\n\nBut as time slowly separates her from the initial attack, it is clear that the attacker is not yet finished with is prey. Michele begins to find her house violated again by the unknown assailant and text messages from the rapist only further the intrigue. But Michele is no victim. She fantasizes about another return visit from the attacker with a more favorable result. And through her emotions she remains consistent in behavior which comes to a shock to others when she reveals the details of the attack.\n\nMaking things more complex for Michelle is her circle of family and friends. A father doing time for being a serial murder, a mother who pays young studs for sex, a son who can&apos;t hold either a job or a girlfriend and her co-workers, some of which she is sexually active with, only complicate her delicate situation.\n\nAlthough Elle might seem like a mystery thriller, it is more of a character driven drama than a &apos;can-you-guess-who&apos;s-behind-the-mask&apos;. So much so that Veerhoven reveals the face behind the ski mask early in the second half of the film. The reveal is to both the audience and to Michelle and how she continues to explore events on her own terms is as fascinating as it is head-scratching.\n\nAlthough Veerhoven has routinely had strong women roles in his films, nothing is on par with Huppert&apos;s Michelle. The film is carried by her strong and intoxicating performance and Huppert is remarkably able to keep us involved and rooting for a woman who is mean and calculating to all those associated with her path.\n\nEvents don&apos;t exactly zig and zag towards an ending but I doubt audiences will be able to stay ahead of the smart script in determining what might occur next to our protagonist.\n\nElle isn&apos;t perfect, but it is perfectly cast and executed. The story will leave most in the cold and it isn&apos;t a feel-good film even if everything does eventually work itself into a nicely bowed present before the end title card.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Finest Hours&quot; (2016 release; 117 min.) brings the telling, &quot;based on a true story&quot; we are reminded, of a daring rescue attempt at sea. As the movie opens, it is &quot;Wellfleet, MA, November 1951&quot;, and we get to know two Coast Guarders who are out on a double date. Bernie (played by Chris Pine) is immediately smitten by Miriam *played by Holiday Grainger). The movie then shifts to February 17, 1952, where Bernie and Miriam are attending a party, and they decide to get married in April. Later that night, as a nor&apos;easter is bearing down, the Pendleton tanker is in serious trouble, and before we know it, Bernie is ordered to assemble a crew and go out to find any survivors of the Pendleton. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you&apos;ll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is a big budget movie from Disney Studios, directed by Craig Gillespie (&quot;Lars and The Real Girl&quot;; &quot;Million Dollar Arm&quot;). If you have seen the movie&apos;s trailer (which as been inescapable in the theaters in recent weeks), you know exactly what you are in for: a bigger-than-life, against-all-odds rescue attempt of the crew of the Pendleton tanker, which has split in two, by a four man crew of the Coast Guard in Chatham, MA. Don&apos;t ask me how the Pendleton&apos;s remaining half tanker doesn&apos;t sink! I think it has something to do with the boat&apos;s balancing tanks, but in the end it doesn&apos;t matter, as we are here to witness some of the wildest open sea disaster scenes you&apos;ll ever see. In a sense, this reminds of &quot;Titanic&quot;, except that the action scenes are pumped up and on steroids. Chris Pine (as Bernie) and Casey Affleck (as the Pendleton&apos;s main guy) are fine, but to be honest, they and the rest of the gang are all second fiddle to the special effects. I know that it&apos;s all CGI, yet it looks so darn realistic! The movie has a great orchestral score, courtesy of veteran composer Carter Burwell (his score for &quot;Carol&quot; received an Oscar nomination). Also make sure to stay through the movie&apos;s end titles, as we then get a bunch of period pictures from the Boston Globe and other news sources with the real life people from the events (and likely the source of the costuming for the film). Last but not least, this is released both in 2D and 3D, but just know that the movie was shot in 2D and then converted into 3D (I saw it in 2D). Bottom line: &quot;The Finest Hours&quot; is a good ol&apos; fashioned disaster-and-rescue drama that is much better than the &quot;experts&quot; would have you believe.\n\n&quot;The Finest Hours&quot; opened nationally this weekend, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. somewhat to my surprise. Regardless, if you are in the mood for an effects-heavy but very realistic disaster-and-rescue movie, I encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray (although a movie of this kind just begs to be seen on the big screen). &quot;The Finest Hours&quot; is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

      "reviewBody": "Jersey Girl I think is an average movie. Definitely not one of my favorites, but at the same time not the worst movie I&apos;ve ever seen. The plot of the movie is well thought out and is a good idea for a movie. Ben Affleck who plays Ollie Trinke is a Manhattan music publicist. He later meets the girl of his dreams and she becomes pregnant. However, his life completely changes when she dies while giving birth. He moves back in with his father in New Jersey to raise his daughter, Gertie, by himself. This movie has emotion and drama, but also comedy at the same time. This film is heartwarming because of the way Ollie Trinke steps up to be the best dad he can be. He really ends up caring for his daughter after getting thrown a curve ball of becoming a single dad. This would be a great family movie.",

It&apos;s not a terrible movie but I just expected more especially from a biker type movie.\n\nIt has a great cast although I have to admit Jodie Comers voice/accent she put on for this movie really grinded on me and it felt nauseating to listen to, that&apos;s just my opinion. For the record I do think she is a great actor though.\n\nThe story didn&apos;t really go anywhere and I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, and well......it just didn&apos;t. The story just seems to plod along with no real direction or plot. Even now after watching it, I&apos;m still not sure what this movie was trying to achieve?\n\nI think this was a missed opportunity and it could have been so much better. It&apos;s worth a watch for the good cast, but just don&apos;t expect to be gripped by the story because there basically isn&apos;t one.",

      "reviewBody": "Instead, I liked it and would gladly watch it again. God Bless America had so much potential. Its first half an hour or so goes as you expect, over the top dark humor with non-stop truth hitting relentless social commentary and then...Roxy walks into the movie. From this point on, unfortunately, without saying much, the movie falls into several paradoxes and loses its focus.\n\nAt its core, GBA is a good social satire with nonstop commentary on the problems with pop culture and society, but on the same coin, the movie tries so hard that it feels like a rant by an angry liberal rather the good satire it initially set out to be. Furthermore, Roxy becomes one of the characters you want dead as the movie goes and her character, along with her and Frank&apos;s relationship, appears so idealized and forced, that it just affects the movie for the rest of its running time. \n\nThe good, however, lies in the great shooting scenes, some of the great commentary made by Frank (most of what Roxy says makes you roll your eyes if not question what in the world the movie was going for), the dark humor, the targets for satire, the over the top story, its entertainment, and overall its a solid 9/10 movie but...\n\nThe bad lies in the second act, on Roxy&apos;s faulty and forced character, its endless rants between our two main character that makes you want them to kill themselves as the next person on their killing spree, the people targeted (whats wrong with high fives and country music? When did this movie become about taste rather than appropriate satire part?) and so on...it just bit itself in the tail.\n\nI really wanted to love this movie. I almost did. Instead every time I went to smile and applaud the commentary, something matter of taste or the character discontinuity got in the way...good movie, definitely one everyone should watch, but sadly, for what it could have been and set out to be, very flawed.",

Along comes Sam Rami to make an &quot;adult&quot; superhero movie with horror overtones. Those of us who knew Rami was involved checked it out and at the time, I wanted it to have MORE horror and less superhero. At this point I can appreciate it for what it is and its a solid superhero movie that would fit much better today than it did at the time bc the adult audience for this genre exists today. Its a very ambitious movie for the time. Still a solid watch. The fx are adequate and the characters are top notch. The bad guys are hissable and the humor is amusing. The plot is clever and the violence and fx are solid. This is a movie worthy of rediscovery.",

Why this happens without incident is anyone&apos;s guess, but I don&apos;t think its supposed to be deep or insightful or anything, and I don&apos;t mean that it insults the audience either.\n\nCate Blanchett is along for the ride, eventually.

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Espionage thrillers can be so much fun in both book and movie form. Movies actually have a little advantage for the action scenes. Books clearly have the advantage in details, backstory and character development. What is frustrating as a viewer is when a movie starts strong and then crumbles under the weight of expectation ... sometimes trying to make a bigger splash than necessary. Such is the case with director John Madden&apos;s remake of the rarely-seen 2007 Israeli film &quot;HA-HOV&quot;.\n\nThe story is centered around a 1965 mission of a trio of Mossad agents. Mossad is Israel&apos;s CIA. These three agents, Rachel (Jessica Chastain), Stephan (Marton Csokas) and David (Sam Worthington) are to capture the notorious Nazi war criminal, the Surgeon of Birkenau (Jesper Christensen), and bring him back for a proper trial of war time atrocities.\n\nFlash forward to 1997 and Rachel&apos;s daughter has written a book about the daring mission and the three heroes. The older version of the characters are played by Helen Mirren (Rachel), Tom Wilkinson (Stephan) and Ciran Hinds (David). We are treated to flashbacks of the mission and how things took a wrong turn, but ended just fine. Or did they? There seems to be some inconsistencies with the story told and the actual events that have created much strain between Rachel and Stephan, and life-altering changes for the more sensitive David.\n\nThis is an odd film because the best story parts occur when the younger cast members are carrying out the 1965 mission. It is full of suspense and intrigue. The intensity and believability drops off significantly in the 1997 version, but oddly, the older actors are much more fun to watch on screen ... especially the great Helen Mirren. I am not sure what all of that really means, but for me, it meant the third act of the film was a bit hokey and hard to buy.\n\nDirector John Madden is known for his fabulous &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, but not much else. His films since then have all come up just a bit short of that very high bar he set 13 years ago. Jessica Chastain continues her fantastic 2011 season adding this performance to her more spectacular turns in &quot;Tree of Life&quot; and &quot;The Help&quot;. Sam Worthington is known for his role in &quot;Avatar&quot;, but his character here is so thinly written, I doubt any actor could have pulled it off. Jesper Christensen seems to usually play the bad guy and he is in full glory here as a Nazi war criminal with no regrets.\n\nThe first half will keep you on the edge of your seat, but by the end you will have a somewhat empty feeling. What a shame as this one teased us with much hope.",

      "reviewBody": "As a debut producer/director team, Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh&apos;s Act of Valor is somehow reminiscent, for lack of better comparison, of Ridley Scott&apos;s &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;. While that comparison works for the genre this movie is suited up for, the highlights here are some fantastic action choreography unlike your typical Hollywood flash-bang formula. The results of which are perhaps due to the Omnipotent force driving this story – the use of active-duty Navy SEALs, acting as active-duty Navy SEALs! \n\nInspired by true events, the premise is an action packed illustration of the cogs and wheels behind the fight for freedom; or in this case, anti-terrorism. After undercover CIA operatives go missing in Costa Rica, a rescue mission by Navy SEALs leads to the discovery that a Chechen defector turned Jihadi terrorist is plotting an attack on America with such magnitude, it could make 9/11 look like a walk in the park. Lead by SOC Dave and LCDR Rorke, a team of seven Navy Seals are re-deployed to prevent Abu Shabal (Jason Cottle) and his undetectable weapons of devastation from reaching highly populated American cities.\n\nBefore addressing the reasons behind why this movie was received with mixed reactions, let me first dwell on what makes this movie different, and in my opinion, worth a watch. First and foremost is the obvious casting of real life Navy SEALs. It&apos;s one thing to watch seasoned action movie stars blow stuff up because you expect them to. Whereas, it is totally different when watching seasoned soldiers do what they have trained so hard to do. This is all too obvious from the way these protagonists talk, to the way they handle a weapon, and by their inherent swagger makes the &quot;A-Team&quot; look like Teletubbies. That said, our heroes are in their element when geared up for the mission at hand, be it stealthy eliminations or running and gunning or jumping off a high altitude aircraft. But like fish out of water, you can&apos;t really expect immersive acting when they are void of camouflage, burst frequency radios, or anything related to battle mode. Dialogue sounds cheesy and read, especially during sub-plots that try to reveal they are also ordinary men with dependent families. Mainstream critics have expressed that the story is packed with propaganda, rather unkindly suggesting Uncle Sam&apos;s invincibility and far reach. While I did feel the SEALs seemed rather invincible towards the end of the movie, I also felt a strong vibe of patriotism instead of the misconstrued propaganda. Perhaps that has something to do with the screenplay coming from Kurt Johnstad, the same person behind the very patriotic ethos in &quot;300&quot;. If I have to nitpick, it would have to be the overdone first-person perspective of having the camera mounted onto the laser sights of assault rifles. One or two scenes would have been acceptable, but this gets so repetitive, it appears to be borrowed from a Tom Clancy page-turner or a PlayStation 3 &quot;Call of Duty&quot; game. \n\nIf &quot;G. I. Jane&quot; (also Ridley Scott) is about the level of intensity and determination put into becoming a Navy SEAL, then this movie succeeds in showing the world why average paid, low profiled individuals risk their lives so that freedom remains a birth right in America. Just before the end credits, McCoy and Waugh also show us the price paid since 9/11 by SEALs who have given up the American way of life, so that the rest of America does not have to. Essentially, Patriotism, not propaganda, is a philosophy other countries should rekindle to keep terrorists out. With that message radiating from the Prologue and epilogue, including acceptable elaboration in between, first time directors McCoy and Waugh have brought out a decent action movie with relevance to the genre as well as the ongoing &apos;war on terror&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "Monster Hunter is a new fantasy action film directed, written, and produced in part by Paul W.S. Anderson, the director of Resident Evil and Event Horizon.\n\nIn the film, Captain Artemis (Milla Jovovich) and her military unit are transported to another world thanks to a strange storm. In this world they are attacked by dangerous, gigantic monsters, which they find difficult to stop with their military weapons. When Artemis meets the mysterious Hunter, she learns that every monster can be defeated in some way. Artemis decides to team up with Hunter to defeat the monsters and hopefully find a way back to her own world.\n\nPaul W.S. Anderson closed the film adaptations of the Resident Evil video game series in 2016. With this film he seems to have started a new video game series filming. Most video game adaptations turn out badly and are often more entertaining for those familiar with the video game the movie is based on. Unfortunately, this is also the case for this film, because the film lacks a real story and clear explanation of what exactly happened in the film. People familiar with the video game or playing it themselves can probably understand this movie a little better.\n\nPaul W.S. Anderson has put this film together with editor Doobie White in a messy way, just like he did with his last Resident Evil film. The film jumps from short, moving action scene to the next. This only makes the movie more difficult to follow and because the movie is in 3D this can lead to headaches for some people. They also use a lot of unnecessary slow motion effects, to convey the movie more exciting, but unfortunately the slow motion only makes the movie unnecessarily long-winded. The monsters in the film look good, but you can see that they were placed in the film with CGI, so they do not all come across as credible.\n\nThe acting is not very prominent either, because no character gets a clear background story, structure or further development in the film. When a monster attacks the group and there are victims, you don&apos;t know exactly who they were.",

SEELE launches an attack on NERV headquarters and the unconscious Asuka is moved to Eva Unit Two while Misoto searches for Shinji. Shinji&apos;s father plans to use Rei Ayanami to initiate the &apos;Third Impact&apos;.\n\nHaving watched the series I thought I knew what to expect but this film takes things to another level. It provides lots of impressive action but this is tempered by the feeling that ultimately our protagonists might not prevail or even survive. The film is made up of two episodes, with the &apos;end&apos; credits positioned between them. The two halves are quite different; the first is where most of the action takes place. Here things are relatively conventional. In the second things are far more existential, not to mention a little confusing at times. Shinji is more irritating than ever but the other characters are great; Asuka was particularly pleasing as she battled nine other EVAs in Unit Two; Rei is as mysterious as ever and other main characters were well used. The animation is impressive, clearly there was more time and money spent on this than the series. Overall I&apos;d say that this is a must see for all Evangelion fans.\n\nThese comments are based on watching the English dub of the film on Netflix.",

Visual effects and CGI are lauded, but pacing and humor are criticized. Core cast performances are strong, though some characters are underutilized. The story is engaging yet predictable, with fan service. Action sequences and soundtrack are highlights, but Shadow's backstory and human characters are disappointing.

      "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s be honest: You&apos;re seeing &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; because you&apos;re either a fan of the gaming franchise or the two films that came before it. I&apos;m a fan of the latter, although they are not perfect. I knew, didn&apos;t think, but knew that this third installment would beat them both, and I was right.\n\nBeginning with Keanu Reeves, breathtaking is putting it mildly. His performance and the overall character of Shadow the Hedgehog, coming from a guy who has never played the games, was jaw-dropping. Dr. Robotnik and Knuckles are great villains in the prior two installments. Shadow surpasses them by having an origin story that, while familiar to veteran players of the games, is more tragic than any of the other characters in the franchise, Sonic included. I&apos;m a huge fan of Reeves; what more is there to say?\n\nEven though Shadow steals the show, the returning characters are still strong. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles are just as funny and charming as their appearances in the previous two entries, helped by Ben Schwartz, Colleen O&apos;Shaughnessey, and Idris Elba&apos;s energetic performances. What surprised me the most was how they put all three in a shocking internal conflict, one which I refuse to spoil in any fashion. You need to see it for yourself!\n\nI can&apos;t forget Jim Carrey as the two Robotniks. First of all, he came out of potential retirement for this. This review is written by a tremendous Carrey admirer, making it a big deal to me when they announced that he would reprise his role as Dr. Robotnik in this trilogy-capper. Of course, he recently said he returned because he needed the money, which is understandable, but this was no cash-grab role for Carrey. He brings some next-level comedic energy when playing both Ivo and Gerald Robotnik. Every time he&apos;s in a movie, he always makes me, and millions more, smile and laugh, and here is no different. Power-rest with pride and dignity, Carrey. Your work will continue to inspire generations to come.\n\nI want to take a break to discuss the experience instead of the movie&apos;s contents. I saw it at a Dolby Fan Event, my second time with the format since &quot;Wicked.&quot; Dolby enhanced both films for me, so be sure to see it that way. The theater I was in did something unexpected: skipped coming attractions. AMC usually allows audiences twenty minutes to go to the restroom or get popcorn by playing trailers for future releases, but not here. I feel bad for the people who came in late under the impression that it wouldn&apos;t start right when they arrived. Additionally, I reserve that time to go to the restroom quickly. However, the film began immediately, and I only focused on the movie rather than anything else, a testament to how excited I was and how extraordinary the following presentation was.\n\nI&apos;ll resume talking about the movie itself now. The action was some of the best I&apos;ve seen all year. The other Sonic films, admittedly, had incredible action, but this cranked the volume up to 11! If we&apos;re only covering action, you bet it&apos;s super fun!\n\nWhat else makes the movie remarkably powerful is it&apos;s hilarious, the story outside of Shadow is compelling, the CGI remains beautiful, and the people in my theater were freaking out at the mid and post-credit scenes. Make sure to stay for that, Sonic fan or not!\n\nIf I were to give any semi-negatives, the comedy simultaneously surpasses and is consistent with the other two films. It&apos;s consistent in how it&apos;s sometimes juvenile to its detriment. I also found Krysten Ritter&apos;s Director Rockwell to be weak, but here&apos;s what&apos;s truly remarkable: I don&apos;t care. In a year in which I&apos;ve perhaps become more of a critic than a film fan despite my personal beliefs that I haven&apos;t, I deserve and need to overlook the flaws because the rest of the film is unbelievably phenomenal!\n\n&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; blew my mind, and I didn&apos;t expect it to. I went in with high expectations, yet still accepted the possibility that it can&apos;t be as wonderful as the hype warrants. I was wrong.\n\nTechnically, the voice acting and performances from the humans (awkward way of saying it, apologies), the CGI, the well-used runtime, and the impactful narrative make the technical score a 9/10. Said 9 is because of some issues relating to the screenplay.\n\nFor the enjoyment score, I loved it! It&apos;s easily the best of the trilogy and one of the year&apos;s best films. I&apos;m writing this before I watch the second film in the hopeful next Barbenheimer post-Glicked: &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; and &quot;Mufasa: The Lion King.&quot; Mufasa has no chance! My problems with some dialogue and Rockwell can&apos;t prevent the enjoyment score from being a 10/10. The flaws are not enough to hurt the experience, and I&apos;m happy I can ignore them. This experience is a must-watch for any Sonic fan and enjoyer of the preceding two films, and I&apos;m thrilled to see what this franchise offers next!"

Along the way, the group is joined by Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), Spleen (Paul Reubens), Baby Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) and The Sphinx (Wes Studi), all of whom provide some riotous lines.\n\nAmong other things, this was the first place where I ever saw comedian Eddie Izzard (he plays Tony P., one of Frankenstein&apos;s henchmen). All in all, the movie is great fun.

The protagonist is a misanthropic, aging man in a neighborhood in Sweden. He spends much of his time telling people if they&apos;re breaking the law. But when an Iranian woman and her family move in, this becomes a new opportunity for him.\n\nIn addition to showing Ove&apos;s relationship with this new family, the movie uses flashbacks to establish what kind of a person Ove is. And believe me, there are some shocking things that happened in this man&apos;s life. I had never heard of the director or cast members before watching the movie, but I&apos;m impressed with their work (including the cat). The movie has some clever scenes, but also makes sure to emphasize the characters&apos; relationships with each other. I hope that Hannes Holm continues to make this sort of movie, and I hope to see Rolf Lassgård in more movies. Bra gjort!",

A lot of jokes flying fast and does not take itself seriously, which is a good thing sometimes. I mean, there was a lot of hyped movies this summer that really let down and took themselves too seriously, so sometimes its great to get a movie that knows it&apos;s dumb and revels in it. Lots of gratuitous nudity, cursing, and stupidity make this one a lot of fun. It may not have the great jokes like super troopers did, but it&apos;s just as funny. Perfect type of movie when you just need to let go for a couple hours. So, if you like broken lizard, watch this movie. If you don&apos;t, stop watching their movies and complaining that they&apos;re not funny. I give it a 7 just cause it took my mind off reality for a while and I laughed quite a bit.",

      "reviewBody": "The family man Juan Oliver (Alberto Ammann) leaves his beloved pregnant wife Elena (Marta Etura) at home to visit the prison where he will start working on the next day as prison guard to make a good impression. During his tour with the guards Armando Nieto (Fernando Soto) and his partner, a stone falls on his head and he faints. The two guards carry him to the empty cell 211, but out of the blue, there is a riot led by the dangerous Malamadre (Luis Tosar) and Juan is left behind by the two guards. When Juan awakes, he pretends to be a prisoner to survive and is forced to meet Malamadre. The leader Malamadre uses three political inmates from ETA as hostages to negotiate with the authorities and Juan helps him to write the terms of the negotiation. Meanwhile Elena finds that there is a rebellion in the prison and heads to the spot trying to get information about Juan. When the situation outside the prison is out of control, the SWAT and violent chief of the guards José Utrilla (Antonio Resines) beat the crowd and Elena is wounded by him. When Juan discovers what had happened with his wife, he becomes closer to Malamadre and changes his behavior taking the side of the inmates. \n\nMovies about prison are usually engaging, but &quot;Celda 211&quot; is spectacular and one of the best films about prison. The dramatic screenplay is realistic, with a story of friendship and pain using the background of the environment of a prison and ETA in Spain, and the tight direction is supported by top-notch performances. The unknown actress Marta Etura is so gorgeous and sweet that increases the impact of her incident. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Cela 211&quot; (&quot;Cell 211&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Many consider &quot;Blow Out&quot; to be the highlight of Brian De Palma&apos;s career, but to be honest I was pretty underwhelmed. It starts of great though. De Palma gets to show of his amazing knack for style in a brilliant opening scene that provides a hilarious pastiche on the slasher genre. The faux-sleazy look, the clever winks at genre classics, the genuine suspense even though you know it&apos;s a movie-within-a-movie, it&apos;s genius at work. There are more of those beautiful stylistic touches spread throughout the movie (the fireworks during the climax would be an obvious example), but the plot is just contrived and the final act demands more than a little suspension of disbelief. And while John Travolta puts in a strong lead performance, obligatory damsel in distress Nancy Allen never really manages to make her character likable so you don&apos;t really care whether she lives or dies. That&apos;s why the obvious Hitchcock influence isn&apos;t as effective as it could have been, Hitchcock gave us characters we deeply cared about and then did awful things to them. Sally is no Marion Crane to say the least, making it more difficult to stay interested in her story. &quot;Blow Out&quot; looks fantastic, but doesn&apos;t go very far beyond that.",

      "reviewBody": "Longing for the American dream should never be inextricable from the determination of an individual. Dreaming about achieving a goal should go hand in hand with proactively doing it. Without veering off on a transcendentalist tangent, let me introduce Kenny Wells. Wells is a pot-bellied, greased up chain smoking alcoholic, perhaps uncomfortably seen as the heir to the throne of the Washoe Mining Company based in &apos;the biggest little city in the world&apos; and where Johnny Cash sang of a prisoner shooting a man, &apos;just to watch him die&apos;. The one and only, Reno, Nevada. So maybe I haven&apos;t painted Wells in such a great light so far. He certainly isn&apos;t the godchild of Emerson, but that&apos;s what director Stephen Gaghan appears to try and convey. This is Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey as you&apos;ve never witnessed before, presented in a way that&apos;s far from an idealised sharp-suited image of the American dreamer and stoically opposed to Ron Woodward&apos;s skeletal frame in his winning performance in 2013&apos;s &apos;Dallas Buyers Club&apos;. However, he&apos;s the film&apos;s gleaming treasure in a somewhat clichéd quest for glory, even if the main aesthetic shine is only from his forehead in an Indonesian jungle.\n\n&apos;Gold&apos; is loosely based upon the Bre-X mining scandal of 1993 with Gaghan confusingly transporting us straight back to the 1980s to a world of questionable suits, post-punk, Iggy Pop and the romantic aspirations of Wells. His journey is somewhat instigated by the death of his father, luring him further into the volatile and unpredictable world of gold mining, conducting the train through its successes and abrupt halts. From the smoky testosterone filled bars of Reno to the sweat inducing tropics of Borneo, we realise how integral McConaughey&apos;s performance is to the success and believability of the narrative. Although somewhat charismatic through his wittiness and general naivety to the overall project, Kenny Wells is a man who is out to make money. Wells&apos; sidekick, geologist Michael Acosta (Edgar Ramirez), is bestowed with elements of morality and spirituality, clearly seen in his proactive interaction with the Indonesian people. So therefore, Wells&apos; financial determination combined with Acosta&apos;s endearing qualities and intelligence make the relationship such a strong focal point of the film. The strength of the characters makes the adventure seem almost tangible, yet still questionable.\n\nLooking at McConaughey&apos;s transformation, you may just begin to question how Kaylene (Bryce Dallas-Howard) has fallen for such a downtrodden hopeless wanderer. However it&apos;s her innocent undying belief in him that makes Wells&apos; decline even more forceful. There is an essence of the childhood sweetheart in her demeanour, the archetypal support mechanism to Kenny&apos;s weaknesses. Yes, she rides on the wave of success to its highest heights with Wells, lavishing herself in material riches but in a way, she is the moral spine of the film, never losing sight of the real Kenny Wells she&apos;s grown up loving. Kaylene acts just as much as the voice of reason as Michael Acosta and it is the combination of powerful relationships that we will really take away from the screen. The dizzying heights of financial success ultimately lead to a strenuous, yet somewhat predictable breakdown between Kenny and Kaylene and we can&apos;t help but feel like she is completely unworthy of any of it. Whiskey plus money plus the inability to maintain your dignity. Well you know the rest. That&apos;s not saying Kenny Wells is a vile person, despite his, for want of a better term, shabby look. We&apos;re willing everything to work out for both of them, yet the American dream just becomes too much to handle.\n\nMcConaughey&apos;s character compared to the regimental sharp suited Wall Street bankers is a deliberate contrast by Gaghan. Our willingness for the sugar coated American dream to work out is pitted against the cold-hearted capitalist intentions of Brian (Corey Stoll). Wells&apos; resilience to counteract an offer made by Stoll and his legion of top button fastened, tight tied troubadours, can only be admired. The ambition to fight against globalisation, to hold onto your dreams, to recapture lost determination and to let nothing stand in your way in fighting for what you want, is made believable through McConaughey&apos;s stellar performance. However, in what should be an adventure full of undying speed to keep up with the lustful desire for success, the film&apos;s narrative is too slow to match the pace of Wells&apos; dreams. McConaughey is the glitter in a film without much gold.",

      "reviewBody": "Despite only finding at best mixed reviews, I had high hopes for this film as a fan of the series; the original Paranormal Activity was a refreshing change from what had become a stale and repetitive phase of horror films. I was apprehensive that a sequel would be a disappointment but was, if anything, better than the first installment. I enjoyed the third film to an extent, turning a blind eye to the repetitiveness and weak story. The cliff-hanger ending reassured me that the fourth Paranormal Activity would answer the fairly basic questions which are the only reasons that we feel the need to watch every film in this series. \n\nHowever, Paranormal Activity 4 is the most disappointing yet. Granted, some moments would make me jumpif those moments weren&apos;t almost identical to the ones in the first, second and third films. Not only are the scares hugely predictable, but this installment doesn&apos;t even answer any of the questions that audiences have. In fact, it somehow manages to raise more, particularly with the frankly terrible ending – OK, so a long time ago, someone in the original family made a pact to give the first-born male to this Demon. The first-born male being Hunter, who was kidnapped by Katie in the second film. We still do not known exactly what this has to do with the coven of countless women who are seen in the third film, and at the end of the fourth film. \n\nAside from the hopes of sucking more money from viewers who have been drawn into the original genius of these films, I don&apos;t see what is stopping the demon from taking Hunter and that being the end of it. Especially now that the demon has control of a Human body (Katie) and all of Hunters family is dead so there is no one to stop it or try to save him.\n\nOverall, this film was hugely disappointing, failing completely to recover from the slump of story line and structure, which the third film saw. As much as I would love to say that I will not bother watching any more of these films, this wouldn&apos;t be true because I need to have my questions answered and find out what it&apos;s all about. All we can hope is that they do something a little bit different next time and finally wrap up the story.",

No matter who tells you that you can&apos;t do it, no matter how unlikely the chances are, no matter what, make sure you go for your dreams and do everything that you can make them come true.\n\nSean Astin delivers one of his best performances to date.  He plays the character of Rudy Ruettiger perfectly!  He was an excellent choice for the role and he deserves a great deal of credit for his work (as does the true life Rudy).  The rest of the cast was quite good as well; Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty, Lili Taylor, Charles Dutton, Robert Prosky, and Vince Vaughn (in one of his first roles).  All of the supporting cast was excellent.\n\nIf you like inspirational movies, or just movies about football (although there is much more to this movie than just football), then I highly recommend you see this film.  I hope that you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,\n\n-Chris",

And that&apos;s what I love about it: it&apos;s just a young boy stealing away on an adventure from his mundane existence. Add to that the trappings of a magical cosmic map, the gallop through the Napoleonic Wars, Ancient Greece and Medieval England, and a cadre of greedy dwarfs and it&apos;s a lot of fun. Even with that cast of familiar faces, David Warner handily steals the movie as Evil (like Sark from &quot;TRON&quot;, only having more fun with it). And I love that the Supreme Being turns out to be a cheeky old British guy.\n\nIt also ends with some sort of statement about modern technology, but that&apos;s just a last-minute zinger. What this really proves is that there&apos;s fun to be had in cult movies, and Sean Connery is awesome.\n\n7/10",

What I didn&apos;t like were 2 things: the story was a bit lame (the directing makes it unpredictable) but otherwise the story was flatly OK. The second thing: the tempo and the editing were fast as if it were a TV series. Other than that, it was excellent. The mood of the movie with its colors and lenses and frames was different than anything I&apos;ve seen, as if the director intentionally wanted to give this genre a different approach. Thus the contre point description: it&apos;s too fast and too lucid to belong to this genre. That being said, I can reiterate now and say I liked this movie. It worked for me. It&apos;s surprisingly haunting, fresh, it doesn&apos;t bore you for a second and it keeps building up. Other than the lame story and the fast editing tempo it&apos;s a great effort by an amateur genius (the director). It lingers in your mind, the contre point aspect, the score, the script, the performance by the actors. It&apos;s really worth a watch.",

The chemistry between Amanda Peet and Ashton Kuthcher is very nice to watch. the actress seems to be the man in this weird and highly coincidental relationship but the hero finds his moments of perfect timings too, does all the right things at the right times. :) A decent theme and pace to the movie overall.

Personal and professional complications ensue. \n\nMagic in the Moonlight is a film directed by Woody Allen and stars Emma Stone and Colin Firth. It is obviously a romance. I&apos;m not entirely convinced by woody Allen since there are years he&apos;ll hit you with movies like Match Point or Midnight in Paris and then, years when you&apos;ll get You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger or Scoop. Nonetheless, this movie throw two very talented actors, in the middle of a quite boring story. In fact there is no tension until ten minutes left of the movie. As usual there are moments where the writing is very clever and seems fresh but they don&apos;t overcome the cliché moments though. this film fits perfectly the build of standard romantic comedy structure: guy meets girl, they do not get along very well at first as they&apos;re opposing, then they start to like each other and suddenly problems happen. In this case nothing really happens, I mean nothing really unpredictable. Colin Firth is very good as this very rude, very mean and hard to live with character. Plus, Emma Stone is really charming, lovely and beautiful; she is also very good. \n\nOverall Magic in the Moonlight as whole is watchable but very conventional; that I could see where the film was headed from the beginning. I am a little bit disappointed because everybody know that Woody Allen is a really talented writer.",

The movie seems to start slowly and the story is only relatively important. More than anything it is an occasion for Scorsese to talk about the NY upper society of the late 1800, and it&apos;s rigid way, sometimes desperate (see Ryder&apos;s character), often cruel to maintain an identity (paradoxically built on the European upper class mold) despite the changes that were happening. I was very impressed by the use of the objects, the clothes of the time to describe the feeling of the scene or of the characters involved.\n\nThe actors are all very good, but Michelle Pfeiffer really delivers and excellent performance. Also Winona Ryder&apos;s character is well portrayed and towards the end of the movie, the actress is able to convincingly show how her character is much more layered than what it seems to be in the beginning of the story.\n\nIn my opinion this movie deserves 8",

      "reviewBody": "I went to see this movie for the sole reason of seeing Glenn Close, whom is a very great actress. Many people had also commented on how great the original was, so I was ready to see this supposedly great film. I was utterly disappointed.  Obviously not sticking to the exact script of the original, the whole thing smelled of modern humor gone terribly bad.\n\nNicole Kidman&apos;s character was, at times, convincing.  Bette Midler&apos;s character was an obvious replay of her previous roles.  Glenn Close&apos;s character was absolutely unconvincing.  But the worst ever was Matthew Broderick&apos;s character.  I just wanted to cry after watching him flounder about in the depthless role of the weak-then-suddenly-brave and-bad husband. And I&apos;m quite sure the original Stepford Wives didn&apos;t have a gay couple--intended, I guess to put a modern twist on it. The characters didn&apos;t have pasts; they didn&apos;t have reasons to act the way they did.  This small detail drove me up a wall:  Faith Hill&apos;s character has a &quot;blow out&quot; at the party and sparks fly out of her ears.  Another wife spits out money like an ATM.  It is later revealed that the wives aren&apos;t robots; they&apos;re merely brainwashed.  So tell me how a normal person shoots sparks out of their ears and money out of their mouths? It doesn&apos;t make sense!\n\nThis movie could have been so much better if someone would have actually read the script and then threw it away and wrote something more meaningful. At the end of the movie, I was left there wondering what its point was.\n\nBut there is one redeeming quality in the movie:  the 1950s styled costumes. They were bright, well fitted, and the only thing interesting on the show. So if you are really into the costume thing, just grit your teeth and sit through this hopelessly ridiculous movie."

I will not go so far as to suggest that Lyne made a better film; he did not.  I do think, however, that he did pinpoint one of the key components of the novel&apos;s genius: a capturing of life on the newly paved highways of mid-century America.  As Humbert, Jeremy Irons is as good as his predecessor James Mason.  Frank Langella&apos;s interpretation of Quilty entirely diverges from the one given by Peter Sellers (and rightfully so; who wants to compete with Sellers?).  But it is Dominique Swain, outdoing Sue Lyon, who comes closer than what ever seemed possible to embodying the essence of the doomed Dolly Haze."

      "reviewBody": "Despicable Me 4 is operating on fumes. Just like last time it&apos;s a bunch of random side plots that just gets it to feature length (credits included). Still, even when these films are operating at a lower level they really understand not to waste your time with another 90 minutes of zany, erratic slapstick that peaks whenever the Minions are on screen, which once again is not enough.\n\nSteve Carell sounds less like Gru and more like himself with every new instalment but he&apos;s still the sole voice actor holding the whole thing together and in this one, he&apos;s broader than ever. Will Ferrell and Sofia Vegara very quickly earn the title of worst villains in this franchise (Minions films included) with grating vocal performances that go for caricature in very annoying fashion.\n\nThe Minions remain really funny even in small doses despite the fact that there&apos;s nothing here as memorable as their big musical number in 3. The Mega Minions are by far the best idea this one has as it allows the film to poke some fun at superhero movies and keep their dynamic fresh. They should&apos;ve been in it so much more instead of being relegated to a small handful of scenes.\n\nChris Renaud&apos;s direction certainly gives the film a lot of energy with the hyperactive pace which can barely stay still. The opening offers the false promise of this one having some genuine stakes before quickly pivoting away from that and turning the film into the cinematic equivalent of a sugar rush which helps to keep things moving at speed even when the jokes aren&apos;t landing.",

      "reviewBody": "The recent history of Hollywood remakes of ghost/horror films from the East has been dismal. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or similar.\n\nIt is well photographed and the sound is superb. Viewing on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS enabled sound system is recommended. Obviously it is subtitled, so if that puts you off, then I wouldn&apos;t bother with this. Dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here.\n\nIt is also genuinely frightening, with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to Western audiences. I would particularly single out the stepmother character, who was utterly brilliant. The ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can cope. The plot is relentless, and offers no comforting moments of release along the way.\n\nIf I do have a small criticism, there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring. We have, however, accepted straight copies of other peoples&apos; ideas for Western films for years, and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10/10. I believe most fans of this genre will derive huge &quot;pleasure&quot; from this film which I for one hope goes down as a classic.",

      "name": "Giant Monsters and Inner Demons",
      "reviewBody": "Colossal is one of those movies that advertises itself as one thing but reveals itself to be something else entirely. While the trailers try to sell it like someone was trying to write a romantic comedy after watching Pacific Rim, the reality couldn&apos;t be further from the truth. One trend I&apos;ve been seeing in indie films lately that I really dig is taking bizarre, out-there premises that are initially played for comedy but slowly reveal themselves to be about something deeper, like how a movie about a talking, farting corpse is actually about personal isolation and the legacy of emotional abuse, or how a movie about a man who will turn into a lobster if he can&apos;t get a girlfriend becomes an examination of the absurdities of modern relationships. In Colossal&apos;s case, the idea of controlling a monster on the other side of the world turns into a metaphor for how self-destructive behavior affects the world around us.\n\nOur story follows Gloria (Anne Hathaway), an unemployed, alcoholic writer who has burned more than a few bridges. After her boyfriend (Dan Stevens) breaks up with her and she&apos;s kicked out of their New York apartment, she moves back to her childhood home and reacquaints with an old friend, Oscar (Jason Sudeikis), who sets her up with a job at his bar. On the other side of the world in South Korea, a giant monster has been appearing out of nowhere and terrorizing Seoul before mysteriously disappearing. Gloria figures out that she&apos;s been controlling the monster, which only materializes and mimics her every move whenever she stands inside of a playground near her house. This becomes especially problematic when Oscar, who turns out to have some serious anger and control issues, discovers he has the same ability (except his avatar is a giant robot) and leverages this power to control Gloria.\n\nThe genius of Colossal is two-fold. As previously mentioned, taking two genres as disparate as the romantic comedy and kaiju films is a novel concept, but director Nacho Vigalondo uses the basic tropes of one to subvert the other. Any fan of kaiju series like Godzilla, Gamera and the like will tell you that while watching giant monsters rampage through the streets is the big drawing point, they&apos;re just as much about the human character arcs and how they intertwine with the walking disasters outside. As for the romantic comedy aspects, they&apos;re virtually nonexistent. I only really bring them up because that&apos;s what the trailer wants you to believe, but I&apos;m here to tell you that the relationship is as far from romantic as you can get. Both of our leads have the same demon (alcoholism), but they cope in different ways, neither of which make them entirely sympathetic, and both of which cause major damage to themselves, their loved ones, and millions of strangers on the other side of the world. For any viewers who&apos;ve dealt with alcoholics at any point in their life, these characters might be uncomfortably recognizable.\n\nOf course, this is truly an actor&apos;s film. Anne Hathaway, playing against type, is easily the more relatable character, but she&apos;s not exactly likable. She&apos;s spoiled, selfish, irresponsible, and nearly all of the bad things that happened in her life were mostly her doing. The first time the monster appears in Seoul is when he drunkenly staggers through the playground at night on her way home from the bar. But there are people who haven&apos;t given up on her, as made evident by the fact that her ex-boyfriend checks up on her regularly to make sure she&apos;s alright. Jason Sudeikis, on the other hand, keeps his drinking problem low key, with his nice-guy persona slowly chipping away to reveal the bitter, entitled, controlling part of him that&apos;s been ruminating on the inside. Both are clearly having a blast with these roles, relishing and channeling their most fatal flaws for maximum effect.\n\nThose looking a good kaiju fight might leave a little disappointed, because while it is the crux of the plot, it&apos;s not the main focus, only being brought into play during major plot points. About 70% of the movie is spent hanging out with Gloria, Oscar and their friends at the bar, but it becomes a major point of leverage when Oscar&apos;s true nature gets more out of control, culminating in a big blowout between the two that nearly results in the annihilation of Seoul, and is resolved in an amazingly clever way that I dare not spoil here, but was enough to make me shoe off the nagging question of why Gloria doesn&apos;t just stay away from that playground.\n\nOverall, Colossal is a one-of-a-kind movie that may not be for everyone, but has a lot to offer for everyone who does choose to see it. The performances are outstanding, the premise is both clever and brilliantly executed, it has a lot to say about toxic behavior and relationships, there&apos;s a great balance between the humor and drama, and even though those looking for some kaiju action may leave a tad disappointed, there&apos;s still something there to tide them over. Don&apos;t be surprised if this ends up becoming a cult classic a few years down the line.\n\n8/10."

      "reviewBody": "The script is laughable and the acting (often voice-over), too. The 3D sex is well marketed. And yes, during certain scenes people got up and left. Yet. The film doesn&apos;t argue to be anything beyond a meandering stroll into the gallows melancholy. And it does this very very well. The film features no highbrow intellectual conversations but instead, favors the same lines you&apos;ve probably slung at your lovers. Again and again and again. Just like the sex you&apos;ve had with your lovers again and again and again. You know their bodies and you know how to please them and above all, you know how to hurt them. Sorrow. There&apos;s a resplendent simplicity here that hypnotizes the viewer.\n\nYou hear music banging inside the club, yet the lovers are outside in halflight. Having sex, obviously. This is a good image of what this film surprisingly achieves best: intimacy. And it fights for that with it&apos;s magnificent camera-work and editing.\n\nBut what would this review be if it didn&apos;t talk about the 3D sex? Love and cinema are inseparable. Love stories are why you stick glued to a chair for a couple of hours. Raw sex is part of love, yet, films used to cut to birds necking after a kiss. Then it became steamy windows. Signs, metaphors, analogies, semiotic nausea. And here, Noé takes that away which makes the film even coarser, and ultimately more brutal.\n\nI wanted to write this review because the whole marketing (&quot;finally a love story restricted for -16) and shock value (an eye-rolling warning in the opening credits) have cheapened what this film has achieved and I encourage viewers to look beyond.",

It was as gritty a performance as I have ever seen from Brosnan and ranks alongside the current Bond and Bourne for tension and is not far behind for action.

      "reviewBody": "Not a classic, but whoa, some of that piano playing just sweeps you right off your feet. Tim Roth is good as the handsome pianist Nineteenhundred and so is all the the rest of the cast. This cast also includes Clarence Williams III, presumably the grandson of Clarence Williams (the man who wrote the song &quot;Basin Street Blues&quot; one hell of a classic), as Jelly Roll Morton. This leads me on to one of the most impressive parts of the film where Nineteenhundred and Morton have a match to see who is the best pianist. There is some piano playing in this scene which will leave pianists with there mouths hanging open. Probably the best thing about this film is it&apos;s music. There are many rousing themes played throughout the film, especially the love theme played while Nineteenhundred kisses a girl he has fallen in love with, a simple yet very effective theme. Another thing that makes this film very good is the fantastic camera-shots, especially one of Nineteenhundred as he stands halfway across the plank which leads him from the boat to New York, undecided whether or not he should leave the boat and head for world-wide celebrity on land, or stay on the boat and remain unknown to anyone but the passengers. I have got to get myself the soundtrack to this film and you have got to see it somehow. Enjoy!",

      "reviewBody": "RUST and BONE immediately drew me in with its arresting cinematography, immediate realism, and so on. The plot is an interesting mix of qualities: compelling but unfocused, surprising but often dissatisfying. As patchy as it is, this story certainly takes you to some interesting places. Several reviewers have noted that we don&apos;t know enough about the characters to really empathize with them. I see what they mean, but I think the lack of information is intentional, and I&apos;m not so sure that it would be better if we did know more--not because they&apos;re such terrible people, but because, you know, does it really matter in the end? The mere fact that reviewers--even those who give it only 1-5 stars--have found so much to analyze here and have interpreted RUST and BONE in so many different ways says something for the substance of this film.\n\nAnyhoo, Ali and Stephanie are both quite real, and RUST and BONE is an interesting mass character study of people at their bests and worsts, who, though it&apos;s nothing dramatic, DO experience some change and transformation at the end, discovering what&apos;s most important to them. Stepanie&apos;s injury and Ali&apos;s love coupled with abuse and neglect of his son are vital ingredients, done with sober conviction.\n\nThose with a low tolerance for raw violence and/or melancholy should probably skip RUST and BONE. Otherwise, it&apos;s an interesting change of pace that stays with you for awhile.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve never really thought about it this way, but I suppose in most cases, it&apos;s an honor to have a sequel. Although no one liked the sequel, I&apos;m sure Jonathon Lynn is proud that The Whole Nine Yards got a sequel somehow. And that seems like the case with Cube 2: Hypercube, a sequel to the cult hit Cube. But then one wonders how there can be a sequel to a movie that was basically all filmed in one 14x14x14 set? Well, Cube 2 is the answer-but not really the best one. It shows what Cube would have been if it had had a bigger budget, but it also showed what it didn&apos;t want to become.\n\nStrangers are thrown together into a series of interconnecting cubes yet again, but this time they&apos;re more high-tech. They&apos;re not different colors, and there&apos;s no booby traps. Instead, some rooms have a cube that attacks you (don&apos;t ask), some have gravity reversed, and time means nothing. There seems to be no pattern, like in the first one, so how are these people supposed to get out?\n\nThis is all one big rehash of the first. There&apos;s the wandering around, talking about the past, and speculation of why they&apos;re in the cube. I guess that&apos;s for people who see sequels before the originals. The characters are all more broadly drawn, the dialogue is cheesier, and it looks faker. In the first, you barely knew anything about the giant cube they were in. Here, it seems like everyone was involved somehow. The ending, which was vague in the first, explained some more, which I was angry yet happy about. It&apos;s hard to explain. But then they left it in the air yet again. Maybe it&apos;s for the prequel, Cube Zero (due out sometime this year) to describe.\n\nBut one positive difference between the two is that this one seemed to be overall scarier. It&apos;s not claustrophobia, but the idea of anything happening in a hypercube. Because they don&apos;t exist, everything goes wild here, allowing for some things to happen. It&apos;s all quite creepy. And although the random crazy psycho killer is more random here than the first, I liked him more, and he was great as he was going through the hypercube. Cube was an original, interesting, and disorienting movie. Cube 2 is the exact same thing, except not as good.\n\nMy rating: 6/10\n\nRated R for language, some violence and brief nudity.",

The filmmakers make no attempt what so ever to hide the fact that this film is almost purely based on these movies, and that my friends is a golden ticket to a inexplicable gore-fest of uber Zombies, a Chainsaw and a lot of intestines being ripped out in the best of entertaining ways. WATCH this film and you wont regret it! i&apos;ll give you my word as a true horror fan.",

      "reviewBody": "When moving from book to motion picture, there are a myriad of problems associated with such a task, one of which comes from those die hard fans of the original story. Fortunately for myself I have never taken it upon myself to read the source material on which this movie is based upon, nor had I even heard of it until now. As a result I found City of Ember to be a gratifying and sensually enticing experience with brilliant performances, an endlessly captivating story and pace, and a great mix of fantastical environments and characters which pave way for subtext that is grounded in simple allegory of our own, current world. To be sure, there are moments when the film dabbles in and out of tired clichés, most of which we have seen countless times this year alone in other children&apos;s adventures; yet what distinguishes this from, say, The Chronicles of Narnia or The Spiderwick Chronicles is through its mature themes and presentation that keeps the older viewer in mind. In this respect, City of Ember is a solid family film that most audiences should enjoy regardless of age, gender or anything else; good entertainment, and a wonderful story to remember at that.\n\nTaking place almost exclusively within the confines of Ember, Gil Kenan here presents us with a vision of a dystopian future, where mankind has been forced to live underground in order to survive. Set many years on from this event however, much of the inhabitants of Ember are unaware of their origin and all the more scared of it as a result. However, in a time of desperation, two citizens Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) and Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) go on their own quest to try and find an exit from the underground city, which doesn&apos;t go down well with gluttonous Mayor Cole (Bill Murray) who just wants his next meal in peace.\n\nWhat follows from here is a story that isn&apos;t entirely unfamiliar (in fact, it&apos;s dangerously close to this year&apos;s WALL-E), and yet director Gil Kenan manages to take the script and turn it into his own compelling take on a tried and trusted concept. From the arresting opening monologue to the somewhat anti-climatic ending, there is barely a spot here that feels out of place or contrived for the sake of playing to the camera. The pacing, particularly during the middle act, could have been a little tighter, and you often get the sense that there&apos;s a lot of footage missing from this cinematic cut, yet as a whole, City of Ember does enough, and with the right amount of originality in tact, to cover up the rough edges. The ending, as I stated, is a little underwhelming and all too brief, but it at least feels coherent and natural to that which comes before it.\n\nIf there&apos;s one thing that Kenan manages to get across here however, it is the imagination and vision that is present in the script and story. Immediately, and most strikingly poignant during the opening sequence, the City of Ember itself is a sight to behold; from the countless lightbulbs that give the city its light to the murky tunnels that run underneath to provide water, the production values present are superb. Furthermore, the special effects work, although a little obvious during certain sequences involving humans, is noticeably strong; particularly when a giant mole-like creature appears. Not only does the creature look disgusting and completely frightening, but the director does well to stage the beast in such a way as to bring out its realistic characteristics; saying that I got flashbacks of Jurassic Park&apos;s raptors scene and a few from Aliens certainly wouldn&apos;t be a negative link to make.\n\nYet as good as the CGI actors are, thankfully the more traditional skin and bones performers aren&apos;t so bad themselves. As Hollywood unknowns (to an extent) Saoirse Ronan and Harry Treadaway give convincing performances in their lead positions and very rarely give attention to their ages. Sure enough, their roles aren&apos;t the most demanding of jobs, but despite their characters&apos; underwritten nature both fulfil the requirements of leads nicely and with enough conviction to consistently carry the film forward. Of course, it&apos;s always good to have a familiar face around, and Bill Murray, playing the obnoxious and gluttonous slob Mayor Cole, is the one to provide such a role. Murray, although arguably underused as far as his talents go, does well to establish a character that nobody is necessarily going to warm to, and uses whatever screen time he has adequately to further the movie on and to back up his lead performers.\n\nIn the end however, all these elements simply come together to create one thing; an adventure. As just that, City of Ember is a very strong and convincing effort from director Gil Kenan who makes his live-action debut here. Sure enough there are countless rough edges present, and characters, although compelling in their quest, fail to resonate emotionally, but the overall adventure itself  that is, the tale  is one that will be sure to captivate imaginations and the attentions of many diverse audiences. With stunning visuals that complement the script&apos;s wonderful sense of imagination, fitting performances, and a very memorable, intelligent and socially relevant story, City of Ember is a fantastic slice of entertainment for all the family to enjoy.\n\n\n* A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)\n"

      "reviewBody": "Made 20 years ago with some former well-known actors, this film has stood the test of time very well and delivers a very interesting and thought-provoking story about the mortality of man.\n\nA group of people in a retirement village discover a neighbouring swimming pool which is out of bounds, but they have fun in it nevertheless.  There are some strange objects lying on the bottom of the pool, but even more strange is the fact that after swimming there the old folk feel transformed and the vigor of their youth returns to their bodies. This makes for some light comedy as their hormones begin to take over.\n\nThese old people have a very serious decision to make and it is not an easy one. This is probably the best part of the film. Should they accept or decline the invitation? Having made the decision there is no turning back! We ask ourselves...what would we do placed in their circumstances? We feel very much involved. Thinking it over, isn&apos;t this proposal very much like what the Christian churches are promising us?\n\nThe final memorial church service by the sea is such a fitting ending and the little grandson David gives such a knowing smile as he raises his eyes to the sky.",

      "reviewBody": "If you are wondering about Luc Besson&apos;s vaguely heretical &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot;, try to imagine a cross between &quot;Excalibur&quot; and &quot;Heaven&apos;s Gate&quot;. It looks great but the basic story gets lost in the histrionics and excess. \n\nThere really was a very religious young girl who was considered a savior to France during The Hundred Years War. Although things may have eventually sorted themselves out the same way without her. Three years after her birth, the new tactics of the English archers were responsible for arguably the most one-sided battle in military history at Agincourt. The result was credited to Henry V&apos;s piety and he got a great passage in Shakespeare. The French aristocracy was almost wiped out by the battle and the English became solidly entrenched in France. Fourteen years later a new generation of French nobility was beginning to assert itself and it was the English and their French allies who were having leadership problems. \n\nBoth countries were Catholic at the time and both claimed that God was on their side, a bit like the football player who thanks God for the victory over another team that apparently God did not favor. \n\nAlthough there are records of both of Joan&apos;s trials (her Condemnation Trial and her Rehabilitation Trial) both proceedings had their own political agenda and should be taken with a grain of salt. Besson&apos;s film seems to follow the generally accepted version of the story but takes obvious liberties with Joan&apos;s mental condition and visions. There is no way to prove or disprove any of this so it is probably as plausible as any other speculation. \n\nWhat hurts &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot; is that Besson&apos;s best scenes are at the very beginning and set too high a standard for the remainder of the film. Jane Valentine is wonderful as the young Joan and Besson shows that his directing skills with young actors was not confined to Natalie Portman&apos;s performance in &quot;Leon&quot;. This early stuff features some of the most interesting scene juxtaposition that you are likely to see in any film. IMHO it gets off to a better start than any film in cinema history. And the sequence where the young Joan is standing on a hill watching as the English burn her village is as visually stunning as anything ever filmed.\n\nBut once Milla Jovovich&apos;s grown-up Joan takes over most viewers will find it difficult to stay focused on the story. It&apos;s not miscasting, Jovovich is noted for aggressive and daring performances (see &quot;The Dummy&quot;) rather than subtlety and nuance, making her a good fit for the take Besson wanted on Joan&apos;s personality. The problem is that while a viewer could identify with the young Joan, the older Joan is just repellent. Her story should be inspirational and tragic. Instead it is a bunch of comic book battle scenes and comical melodrama. \n\nBut it is worth watching for the production design and the beginning sequences. \n\nThen again, what do I know? I&apos;m only a child.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Visually arresting, methodically paced, and almost perfectly executed&quot; says another review here. I agree and would add well-acted, produced, and directed. But it still doesn&apos;t quite make it as a movie, something with a real story that is effectively delivered and is more than the sum of its strung-together parts. Each scene is fine, but they just seem like a string of episodes rather than a coherent story. One has trouble getting the point and is left somewhat confused and unsatisfied, with the final twist more baffling than impactive. I would say that the words &quot;inchoate&quot; and even &quot;incoherent&quot; can&apos;t help but come to mind regarding the film.\n\nBefore you write me off as someone who only likes nice linear films where EVERYTHING is made perfectly clear and who can&apos;t handle anything unusual, abstract, metaphoric, or different in any way, compare &quot;Signal&quot; to &quot;Dark City&quot;, the recent &quot;Under the Skin&quot;, and even &quot;THX 1138&quot; (which BTW arguably has a lot of similarities to this one).\n\nMeanwhile, for examples of films that have similar problems as &quot;Signal&quot;, see &quot;Citadel&quot; (2012), &quot;Critical Nexus&quot; (2013), and even &quot;Shuttle&quot; (2008) or &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot;. I would argue, tho&apos;, that most of these, whatever their flaws, are probably more effective at delivering a real story than &quot;Signal&quot;. MEANWHILE, to see what a low-budget independent sci-fi movie CAN be, see &quot;Moon&quot; (2009).\n\nFinally, I was just reading a review of &quot;Signal&quot; in which the reviewer mentions another director who started out with a middling low-budget sci-fi film and has gone on to bigger and better accomplishments; he sees similar potential in the director of &quot;Signal&quot;. I fully agree. Again, I think &quot;Signal&quot; was impressive and well worth seeing, but doesn&apos;t quite make it to the level of a real and effective movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Enticed by free t-shirts and comfortable seats, two of my friends and I made the journey to Alexandria last Saturday to catch the sneak Preview of Whip It. Upon our arrival, our expectations were not high, as none of us were fans of Drew Barrymore.\n\nOnce the movie began, however, our opinions quickly changed. Drew Barrymore may not be the best actor, but she definitely has chops at directing. Whip It is the tale of a girl who hates life in a small town so she decides to rebel by joining a roller derby team with often comedic results. The movie is much better than plot may sound. It has some cliché moments but definitely beats the standard chick flick.\n\nThe film had a very unique feel, shifting between humorous and hipster-esquire scenes. This also was probably my biggest problem with the movie. The comedy often reminded me of something out of an Owen Wilson film but then the dramatic scenes reminded me of something more hip than Juno. That being said, the movie was much funnier than the average chick flick.\n\nEllen Page is superb as usual, taking on a somewhat different role than what I&apos;ve seen before. It&apos;s impossible to compare her to her role in Juno, as in Whip It she plays a much more introverted, but still conflicted girl.\n\nAndrew Wilson was probably the funniest character in the movie. I&apos;m actually wondering where this guy came from. The other two Wilson brothers are huge and this guy just comes out of nowhere. Hopefully we&apos;ll see more of him, as he is just as funny as Owen and Luke.\n\nDrew Barrymore had a very small role in the movie. The few scenes she is in are certainly not ruined by her. Landon Pigg should probably stick to music, or maybe even quit that because he sucks at that. He is not an actor, and that was prevalent throughout the movie. Jimmy Fallon provided a solid array of one-liners as the quirky announcer for the games.\n\nThe rest of the cast was solid, including Marcia Gay Harden as the strict but loving mother. Juliette Lewis is good as the over-the-top, intense player who takes things way too seriously. Alia Shawkat I couldn&apos;t stand but I just can&apos;t stand her in general.\n\nThis movie definitely goes far beyond what any average chick flick would. In fact it&apos;s hard to classify it as such, as I found it good and I&apos;m a dude. All things considered it&apos;s definitely worth checking out if you&apos;re a fan of hip movies or just comedy in general.",

      "reviewBody": "The central plot of the movie follows a somewhat traditional trajectory, reminiscent of numerous Indian films and works like &quot;A History of Violence,&quot; adapted from a graphic novel by John Wagner. Nonetheless, Director Lokesh, in collaboration with his writing team, skillfully injects a rejuvenating dose of suspense into the storyline with brilliantly executed plot twists. It&apos;s worth noting that the flashback segments seemed hurried and unconvincing, which affected the second half, and the pacing in the first half could have benefited from some tightening, especially the over-budget hyena sequence.\n\nTo avoid revealing any spoilers, I&apos;ll conclude my thoughts here.\n\nVijay delivers a commendable performance in both of his roles. While his appearance as Parthiban, a character in his mid-40s, may not be exceptional, it remains acceptable, and his acting is good. His portrayal of Leo, on the other hand, looks good but doesn&apos;t offer much to act on because of the short duration.\n\nTrisha didn&apos;t get a meaty role, but as always, she delivers a fantastic performance, radiating beauty even in a role that requires her to portray a woman in her 40s and a mother of a teenager. Her on-screen chemistry with Vijay is superb, a genuine treat for their fans.\n\nSanjay Dutt&apos;s presence in the film is decent, though his acting doesn&apos;t quite match up to the overall cast&apos;s caliber. Arjun Sarja&apos;s role is actually useless, but his appearance and acting are good.\n\nThe supporting cast delivers their best efforts, contributing to the film&apos;s overall quality. Priya Anand and Anurag Kashyap are underutilized.\n\nThe action sequences are well-executed and visually appealing. The cinematography showcases moments of extraordinary brilliance, although it falls short in some areas. The songs may not be remarkable, but the background score is notably strong. The film&apos;s locations, sets, and costumes are adequately done, while the VFX work could have been more refined.\n\nLokesh&apos;s direction deserves recognition for steering the film in a positive direction, but he should work on his writing.\n\nIn summary, I recommend experiencing this movie in theaters to fully appreciate the cinematic journey it offers. #LCU.",

      "reviewBody": "The countdown clock is rollingSonny Weaver Jr (Kevin Costner) the General Manager of the Cleveland Browns has a decision to make. Sonny has the first pick in the NFL Draft. Whomever he selects, his job, the job of Coach Penn (Denis Leary) not to mention the future of a billion dollar franchise and the hopes and dreams of a city ride on what he decides.\n\nDraft Day is the latest entry in the sports drama from Kevin Costner, no stranger to epic sports films such as Bull Durham and Tin Cup. Draft Day is about the hours leading up to the NFL Draft and the turbulent drama, relationships and chaos enveloping the beleaguered General Manager of the Cleveland BrownsSonny Weaver Jr. The film opens with Weaver&apos;s girlfriend and colleague, Allie (Jennifer Garner) announces to him that she is pregnant with their child. As the day continues Weaver works the phones with various general managers, all of whom try to fleece him for draft positioning. With pressure mounting by owner Anthony Molina (Frank Langella) Weaver succumbs to the rip off deal proposed by the Seattle Seahawks GM to move up to the top pick in the draft. As news of the trade is leaked via the Twittersphere, everybody and their brother is up in arms as the previously expected pick of fearsome linebacker Vontae Mack (Chadwick Boseman) is now thrown into doubt and the projected top pick in the draft, Wisconsin Quarterback and franchise making player Bo Callahan (Josh Pence) is within reach for Sonny.\n\nAs the film continues, Weaver investigates the curious Bo Callahan via his head of security who uncovers some bizarre behavior by the top prospect. Meanwhile Weavers mother arrives at Sonny&apos;s office to honor her late husband (who died the previous week) Sonny&apos;s dad and former coach of the Cleveland Brownswhom Sonny fired. Through the day Weaver is left to resolve his issues with Allie in between screaming matches with his owner, players, coaches and basically any body he makes eye contact with. There are plenty of cameo appearances with real NFL players and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, including a rather pointless appearance by Sean &quot;P-Diddy&quot; Combs as Bo Callahan&apos;s agent\n\nTHE VERDICT: Draft Day is ultimately a story about choices, their consequences and ultimately redemption set again the wheeling and dealing of what has become an important day for sports fans. Comedy directing legend, Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Stripes) takes a departure into the realm of the sports drama to helm DraftDay. Reitman expertly guides his characters through the standard sport films clichés and keeps the film at a high level so that hardcore sports fans as well as non sports fans can appreciate the film. The film is a well paced whirlwind drama that makes for an enjoyable outing at the movies.\n\nSee more of my reviews at www.silverscreened.com",

The movie follows Gael Garcia&apos;s character as he moves back to his mothers home in Paris and finds himself falling for the girl across the hall. Gael&apos;s character experiences reality through dreams and the present, creating all sorts of confusion. The movie has some of the most unique props and eccentric animation pieces I have ever seen, but would you expect anything less from Gondry (Eternal Sunshine..). This movie really can&apos;t be described in truth but holds so much potential for multiple viewings as its so full of life and visual wonders for the eyes. Gael Garcia is just perfect in this role and is fascinating in gesture and laugh out loud funny when the script allows. I think you should definitely look forward to seeing this movie when it gets a wide release, its funny, its art, its pleasure for the eyes and a puzzle for the mind.",

      "reviewBody": "Sidney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work for the popular magazine Sharpe&apos;s in a hope to live his dream lifestyle but struggles to make a lasting impression.\n\nBased on Toby Young&apos;s book about survival in American business, this comedy drama received mixed views from critiques. Labelled as inconsistently funny but with charm by the actors, how to lose friends seemed as a run of the mill fish out of the pond make fun at another culture comedy, but it isn&apos;t.\n\nThis 2008 picture works on account of its actors and the simple yet sharp story. We start off in the past, then in the present and are working our way forwards to see how Young made his mark at one of America&apos;s top magazines.\n\nPegg (Hot Fuzz) is too likable for words. Whether it&apos;s hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing his sidekick the nature of the law the English actor brings a charm and light heartedness to every scene. Here, when the scripting is good but far from his own standards, he brings a great deal of energy to the picture and he alone is worth watching for. His antics with &quot;Babe 3&quot; are unforgivable, simply breathtaking stuff as is his over exuberant dancing, but he pulls it off splendidly.\n\nBridges and Anderson do well at portraying the stereotypical magazine bosses where Dunst fits in nicely to the confused love interest. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, reminds everyone she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotype film star. The fact that her character Sophie Myles is starring in a picture about Mother Teresa is as laughable as her character&apos;s antics in the pool. To emphasize the point there is a dog, and Pegg rounds that off in true Brit style comedy, with a great little twist.\n\nThough a British film there is an adaptation of American lifestyle for Young as he tries to fit in and we can see the different approaches to story telling. Young wants the down right dirty contrasted with the American professionalism. The inclusion of modern day tabloid stars will soon make this film dated but the concept of exploitation of film star&apos;s gives this edge.\n\nWeide&apos;s first picture is not perfect. There are lapses in concentration as the plot becomes too soapy with an awkward obvious twist and there are too many characters to be necessary. The physical comedy can also be overdone. As a side note, the bloopers on the DVD are some of the finest you will ever see, which are almost half an hour long.\n\nThis comedy drama has Simon Pegg on shining form again and with the collective approach to story telling and sharp comedy, it is worth watching.",

And that&apos;s a great shame, because in these troubled times that&apos;s perhaps exactly what people want. A good night out at the cinema.\n\nSaoirse Ronan again proves what a huge career she could go on to have, this time adding light comedy to her range of skills, in this murder mystery caper.\n\nThese are ten a penny right now, both on the big and small screen, but &apos;See How They Run&apos; manages to find its own style, with some clever tricks up its sleeve throughout.\n\nThere are lots of big or recognisable faces dotted throughout this fun film, but the stand-outs are Ronan and Sam Rockwell as her superior. I&apos;d actually be happy if this led to another outing for the pair.\n\nOverall, good fun.",

Scott Walker has made a very gruesome, realistic, deeply disturbing (at times) work that shows the rotten depths of a psychopath&apos;s mind (John Cusack, a real gem of the film), and his main antagonist, a National Guard officer (Nicolas Cage, by the way, a very decent play here). Then, there is a young lady involved in wild world of pimps, drugs and alcohol, and she plays a key role here, too. The plot is very straight and often blood-chilling, and the twists of plot can really mesmerize. In fact, the movie was a bit slow sometimes, but nobody in the audience left the theater, &apos;cause it was real thrilling. The spellbinding Alaskan nature is a real must see here, it simply leaves speechless with its sheer vastness and beauty. Great job of cameramen, though. The story is clear from the trailers and here the whole plot untwists slowly for almost 2 hours, but this is quite good, as the movie never drags. Constant Alaskan snow adds up to the growing suspense. The film is not the masterpiece but worth watching and very strong as a message. Great ending, by all means",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Circle.&apos; It&apos;s a pretty tight little film, basically filmed only in the one location for an hour and a half – the location being a completely pitch black room with fifty red spots on the floor. In each, stands a random stranger and every couple of minutes one of which gets zapped by – er – something and brutally killed before their body is dragged off into the gloom. Confused? How do you think the fifty people feel?! And that&apos;s that – fifty people turns to forty. Forty turns to thirty and so on. It&apos;s a tough sell and it&apos;s probably never going to be a mainstream hit (especially as about the most well-known face is Dexter&apos;s wife from the TV series of the same name). Anyway, I think it deserves a cult following as I&apos;m sure it will find an audience out there somewhere.\n\nIts simple premise and delivery kind of reminded me of other (rather fun films) such as The Human race and Cube. Yes, it&apos;s hardly action-packed. The fifty people can&apos;t even move off their little red spot on the floor – if they do, that nasty zapper comes back for them again and that&apos;s that for them. What you have is a kind of morality tale about what people would do in this situation. Would they vote to kill people they don&apos;t know just to save themselves, or would they try and save everyone? It&apos;s not going to be everyone&apos;s cup of tea. I can see plenty of people finding it boring, or being annoyed at the ending (I won&apos;t say why – you&apos;ll have to check out the internet message boards!), but if you&apos;re in the mood for something a little different and without any major car chases or Marvel superheroes destroying entire cities then give this one a go. I found it on Netflix and was glad I did – definitely worth seeing if you&apos;re in the mood for something dark, talky and that will make you question what you&apos;d do in this most of weird and extreme of situations.",

      "reviewBody": "Oh, my God, I finally saw TMNT, I don&apos;t know how many opportunities to see TMNT in the theater, but it never pulled through. But I finally got to see the movie this morning on DVD; I have to say that over all the movie really worked. While I would still prefer the live action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film made back in &apos;90, this was a fun adaption as well. The CGI was always an ifie subject with me, but I think that it worked for the simple fact of where this movie was aimed at, mostly a children&apos;s audience, and the dark animation made you feel as if you were in the comics. The voices were a perfect fit and the story was very cool. The only problem I had with the movie is that it seemed to be like more of a video game than an actual movie, it could have just been more creative I think. But the story worked very well.\n\nThe turtles are back and they are about to face their biggest villain yet, a bunch of immortal stone monsters who are wishing to stay this way. But it gets harder when Leonardo comes back from the jungle just trying to become a better leader, but Rapheal isn&apos;t in the mood when he wants things done his own way. Now the boys must try to fight as one to fight off these monsters, with Splinter, Casey Jones and April O&apos;Neil on their side, they just might be able to pull together and save the city once again.\n\nTMNT is a fun animation movie that I&apos;m sure kids will love. I was 5 when the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie came out and I admit, I still watch it to this day, I still love the turtles, so I guess I was looking for those old memories. But since this wasn&apos;t really aimed towards the old school fans, I think it was somewhat of a disappointment, but it is worth a watch. I definitely think if you enjoy the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles stories, you&apos;ll get into TMNT.\n\n6/10",

      "reviewBody": "The film begins with top notch cinematography.\n\nThe story is unique, bringing mythology n the moral subject of human greed.\n\nThe story is based on the spooky Indian mythology/horror folktale of a demon who is loaded with gold but deprived of food.\n\nOne family has been able to revive the demon by building a temple inside an isolated n creepy mansion. Cos of this the family is ostracised.\n\nThe mansion is huge with big doors n fort like walls n only the old father resides in the mansion. The wife/mistress do visit the mansion everyday to give the old husband a hand-job n while she gives him the hand-job, she asks him to hurry up, to which the oldie replies in a funny way.\n\nThe wife also inquires about a gold coin which is kept near the demon&apos;s idol.\n\nThe house of the family is walking distance away from the mansion which is inhabited by the wife n her two kids along with the great great grandmother of the old husband who is being cursed to live forever after the bite of the demon n the old hag needs to be fed regularly while she is asleep or she might resort to cannibalism.\n\nThe house is a striking image on top a hill, reminding viewers of isolation in the countryside.\n\nThere are no close-by neighbors, as the family is on their own after their ostracisation.\n\nThere is something very trance like feel in this movie, especially the weather n the locations.\n\nThe constant rain and vivid, well filmed local landscapes are characters themselves.\n\nIt is dark n claustrophobic with palpable atmosphere.\n\nKudos to the cinematographer n director, they did a fantastic job in creating a perpetual and palpable sense of tension and fear.\n\nThe director also did a nice job of building a concrete, hypnotizing story without ever having to sacrifice pacing.\n\nThe story takes place in a span of thirty years n the details r appropriately handled.\n\nIf u notice the mansion in the beginning n after fifteen years, u will see all the details.\n\nAttention has been paid in the local ethnic details, the time period, costumes n architecture.\n\nAlso the moral subject of greed n lust are handled very well.\n\nThe subject of Sati n female subjugation are sprinkled but not explored.\n\nSoham Shah and the kids gave noteworthy performances.\n\nAppreciate Soham n the producers for producing such a good horror film.\n\nKudos to the director for a fantastic twist ending.\n\nLove to see a prequel or sequel with more emphasis on the true horror Sati n the demon&apos;s backstory.",

A family&apos;s routine ski trip is thrown into turmoil when he responds poorly to an apparent avalanche. The movie is largely a character study of the aftermath. The problem is that it is one of those movies with virtually no sympathetic characters. As such it&apos;s a bit of a difficult watch. It is hard to join the movie in its search for meaning, when the main characters are so alienating and off-putting. Even the kids in the family aren&apos;t particularly sympathetic. Further, the movie attempts to wring way too much melodrama out of a relatively minor incident. For me it was more tiresome than enlightening. Finally, I thought some of the plot devices were amateurish; too many plot twists depended on cell phones not working. While I appreciated the film&apos;s ambition, it did not work for me.",

People seem to have a problem with the way violence is portrayed but I liked how the directors portrayed the brutally and the honest way death was portrayed. Thankfully, it&apos;s not excessively sugar-coated and there are some very sad scenes but it beautifully ends on the note of hope. I liked the way Leighton and Zondag told Enriquez&apos;s written story but I thought that some of the situations weren&apos;t developed. For example, how does Aladar adjust to the lifestyle of the dinosaurs considering that he was raised by lemurs. Most likely it may have been due to time constraint but nonetheless the current adventurous story of migration and survival is engaging and moving. Aladar&apos;s selfless attempts to save the dinosaur&apos;s are touching to watch as it reflects how the kind-hearted Plio raised him. The characters are enjoyable and the voice cast, that includes talents like Alfre Woodard, Joan Plowright and Ossie Davis do a fine job. D.B. Sweeney too does a very good job voicing Aladar. The animation is very detailed, giving the characters and setting a very authentic look. Even though the slight stop motion takes away from the realism, this is only a minor quibble. Newton Howard&apos;s score flows well with the story. &apos;Dinosaur&apos; is sheer beauty and a pleasure to look at. It&apos;s a dinosaur classic and it&apos;s become one of my favourite dinosaur films."

The way the kids treated her was very disturbing and I felt an accurate indictment of modern society and its emphasis on the superficial. The main themes of &apos;Family&apos; &amp; &apos;Love&apos; were very well portrayed. Overall I would give this film 7.5/10, a gritty, violent depiction of Urban Decay and the injustice of the supposedly equal legal system.",

I can see how people would be put off if they were expecting a serious historical reenactment. Still, I believe that Ron Howard fully meant for this to be a fully romanticized account of the time. This movie works in many of the ways Titanic does, and I think it does it more effectively. Still, with Titanic, most people seemed more than willing to overlook the absurdities. With Far and Away, I don&apos;t think Ron Howard was trying to trick us or dumb us down. I don&apos;t think he was ever trying to underestimate the intelligence of his viewers. I think he was asking us to follow him and trust him as he told a story. I enjoyed it. Kidman and Cruise were both fun to watch. The supporting cast, although they did seem like they came from a comic book, were entertaining. I hope this movie has life on cable and DVD.",

My only sadness is that Paul Geoffrey and Nigel Terry, two of the main character actors, seem not to have become such household names.

      "reviewBody": "I have been looking for this movie everywhere for years. In mid 2021, I happened to know it&apos;s now on Hotstar. I jumped on it, however, not in the greatest of moods I expected I would watch this movie in. The Cast is exceptional. Gal Gadot impresses yet again. Zach is not the Zach we have known. He seemed lost through out. He didn&apos;t seem to be in character. I didn&apos;t expect such from the actor I was watching this movie for. He really didn&apos;t do a good job.\n\nComing to the story, it seemed average, not bad really. For first, it felt as if I&apos;m watching the remake of a bollywood movie, Ajnabee. That movie was on another level. And this one, really kept losing the sense. It didn&apos;t have much comedy either, all the comedy it had made it even sillier and dumb. It felt as it it will pick up, but it didn&apos;t much. Although the end was convincing enough, however the antagonist was meaningless and weak; very weak. We love to see comedy, however, not with antagonist&apos;s silly mistakes making the crowd laugh. An antagonist is expected to be the strongest individual than any in the story. And the movie is a journey of the protagonist&apos;s struggle, failure, hard work and ambition, and a process of making him stronger than the the antagonist with such struggle, hard work and failures. This movie lacked the base a story has. For comedy, it tried a lot, still, couldn&apos;t deliver. They ticked only one box rightly of a sound story; having a proper climax. They justified the new couple&apos;s existence and designed a proper end to it.\n\nI was disappointed with this movie, however, If you are looking to waste time or want to watch something for passing the time, you can give a try. It won&apos;t keep you at the edge of your seat though.",

How refreshing to see a mature actor creating appropriate roles, and not trying to be a plastic version of his - or her, for that matter in many cases - former self playing inappropriately younger parts. He is excellent in this movie. Amy Adams is, as in every film I&apos;ve seen her in, a total delight. I never was a fan of John Goodman in his earlier years, but the older he gets and the meatier the roles he takes on, the more appreciation I have for him. And Justin Timberlake has a role absolutely meant for him. He is a sexy little hunk, no doubt about it, with personality to spare. Oh, I loved this movie! The exhilaration of baseball, the heart-tugging familiarity of family issues.this one has a lot going for it and I enjoyed each and every minute of it. It&apos;s as good as expectations built it up to be. I would advise you not to miss this one!",

      "reviewBody": "Despite its bland, unimaginative title, I found this a taut, well-wrought ghost film. At times, the plotting reminded me of earlier genre-classics like &quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;The Others&quot; and especially &quot;The Innocents&quot;, the latter based on Henry James&apos;s definitive &quot;The Turn Of The Screw&quot;, all being concerned with the precarious psychological condition of the main character and of course of unhappy spirits from the past returning to impact on the present.\n\nThe present here, though, is immediately post-war England, and the tragedy and tension of those times, with the themes of the loss of what Seigfreid Sassoon called doomed youth, the psychological (and physical) scars on those that survived the Great War while their friends perished (personified here in the character of Mallory) as well as the enmity between those that fought and those that didn&apos;t (the latter portrayed in the character of Judd, the school caretaker), loom large in the character studies presented here.\n\nAt its heart however is the complex character Florence, a vintage if very young, &quot;ghost- buster&quot; if you will, herself bearing guilt over her part in the loss of her own soldier sweetheart, eventually takes on, at Mallory&apos;s beseeching, a new case, involving the unexplained death of a young boy pupil at a remote boarding school, supposedly haunted by an earlier pupil from years before. \n\nThe story takes many twists and turns with some scares and jumps along the way, revealing its major twist effectively and by the end just about explains its complexities although I&apos;m sure there are still some strands I&apos;m not quite connecting in the summing up. \n\nThe period is evoked excellently, the cold, austere boarding school in particular and the acting too is very good by all especially Imelda Taunton as the the school matron whose importance to the story becomes clearer as it progresses and particularly Rebecca Hall as the central character of Florence, her haunted eyes and blank expression well conveying the fragility of her character beneath her initially super-confident Holmes-ian demeanour.\n\nIf I have a criticism, it is that the Florence character is probably too overloaded with her various neuroses plus a lot happens to her in the narrative, but as in the end, it turns out to be all about her anyway, maybe I should grant the director and writer a little more licence.\n\nAnyway, more psychologically thrilling than downright scary, this was my type of ghost film, just right for a late night viewing.",

It is a very strange movie directed by Brandon Cronenberg, the son of David Cronenberg (&quot;Videodrome&quot;, &quot;The Fly&quot;, etc.) It is about a couple (Alexander Skarsgård and Cleopatra Coleman) who travel to a luxury resort in a repressive dictatorship. They meet another couple (Jalil Lespert and Mia Goth) who convince them to travel off the grounds of the resort, even though it is prohibited by the rules of the resort and country. Soon a tragedy occurs, and the couple is thrust into a fever dream of drugs, sex and violence. Mia Goth is excellent as the temptress who pushes Skarsgård&apos;s character into doing things he would never think of doing. Skarsgård is wasted in this role and his character takes actions that defy common sense. And while some have praised Brandon Cronenberg&apos;s direction - I found some of the strange angles and quirks he uses to be more annoying than ingenious. There is a surfeit of sex, violence and gore for those who enjoy that, but I cannot say that it really added anything to a convoluted plot that really makes no sense. Only recommended for Mia Goth&apos;s standout performance - wait for cable or Netflix on this one. 5/10.",

The third time was not the charm.\n\nI must say, either my tastes have gotten much more discriminating or this cast is getting worse with each picture. I find Ashley Tisdale about as screechy and annoying as fingernails on a chalkboard, and she was worse than ever in HSM3. Ditto Corbin Bleu, so cheerful and peppy that it gets a little sickening. All of the &quot;actors&quot; come off like over-eager stage-children, but those two are probably the worst offenders. None of the case- and I mean none- are believable as real, human high school students.",

      "reviewBody": "In 2016, Nicholas Stoller (Get Him to the Greek &amp; Neighbors) and Doug Sweetland (Presto) presented Storks, an animated film from Warner Bros. Animation Group (The Lego Movie). While it had a mixed critical reception, it&apos;s definitely a movie that typical movie-goers and families may find adorable and funny?\n\nThe main plot centers on a stork company that delivers packages and babies. When the top delivery stork, Junior, becomes boss of the workers, he is told to fire the only human working there, Orphan Tulip. Instead of firing her, he sends her to the defunct mail room. Meanwhile, the son of two workaholic parents, Nate Gardner, sends a letter to the company asking for a baby sibling to play with. When the letter arrives, it creates a baby, so now Junior and Tulip have to deliver the baby to it&apos;s guardians while going through many obstacles like avoiding getting noticed by the company&apos;s CEO Hunter, a pack of hysterical wolves, and trying to care for the baby itself. \n\nIn concept, the film has all the right ideas to make a charming comedy for the whole family, and it mostly succeeds in it&apos;s execution. Even though the journey Junior and Tulip go on feels similar to almost every Pixar film (e.g. Inside Out and Finding Nemo), the film gives the characters enough time to develop off each other, where they came from, and what each other&apos;s goals are, even if their quirky eccentric personalities don&apos;t always contrast that well. The subplot featuring Nate and his family, however, does come off as rather straightforward and it&apos;s easy to guess what will happen since all his goal is to have a baby sibling. It doesn&apos;t help that the movie itself does come with some tired film clichés, not just the duo who overcome each other on their obstacles, but also the workaholic parents who try to make their son happy, the big promotion from one job to another, the side villain finding out where the heroes are, and even how the main villain tries to get rid of the protagonists.\n\nAs for the rest of the characters, the CEO of the company Hunter at first comes off as a trustworthy boss, but there&apos;s quite a nerve he has with babies which presents him as threatening and cunning. The pigeon Toady can either be amusing or annoying with his exaggerated &quot;bro&quot; voice, but he&apos;s also a decent deuteragonist as he only follows his orders to make the most of his job. As stated before, the Gardner family have the same trope of the little kid who wants his busy parents to spend more time with him, so they decide to bond with him more to make him happy. And then there are the wolves led by the alpha and beta, who deliver the absolute funniest parts of the movie due to their personalities constantly shifting from menacing to energetically adoring the baby, as well as performing the best visual gags in the film.\n\nHowever, if there are two things this movie really nailed in the execution, it would be the heart and the humor. The filmmakers definitely knew when to have cute sentimental moments with the baby, and they always come off as adorable instead of schmaltzy. Also, when the movie&apos;s main characters have their moments of relief and sentimentality, it gives the film a lighthearted tone that never comes out randomly, and portrays the scene with just the right emotion to make the audience feel for them. However, the humor would have to be the highlight of the movie, as there&apos;s plenty of one liners, visual gags, surprisingly decent pop culture jokes, slapstick, subversion and line deliveries, and it&apos;s very rare when they miss their mark as they have such exquisite timing and charm to them. Also, since Junior and Tulip do spend the journey caring for the baby, they spend time feeding and trying to put the baby to sleep, which also makes the movie relatable to any parents who raised their own offspring. \n\nSince the movie acts more on the cartoony side, it creates the animation to be as cartoony as it can, and it did the job beautifully. The characters look kinda simplistic, but given the silly nature of the film, they contrast well, and their movements can get exaggerated and wacky at just the right moments. Although some of the places they leads go to range from a cave, to the Arctic, to suburbs, the animators still give the backgrounds life and present them in colorful, unique, vibrant, and bright manners. The effects animation is also quite creative such as the factory robots, the water, the machine that creates babies, and even some of the lights and electrical effects. The only criticism there is to give the animation is that many of the storks look like the exact same model (probably by means of cheaping out a bit), but they don&apos;t ruin the sporadically wonderful quality that the visuals have to offer.\n\nWhile Storks may not have flown as high up as other animated films of 2016 such as Kung Fu Panda 3, Zootopia and Kubo &amp; the Two Strings, it did offer enough good laughs, silly concepts, well crafted animation and memorable characters to stand on it&apos;s own. If you&apos;re in the mood for a cute little family comedy with some relatability to those who have raised babies before, then this will be a delight from beginning to end, especially since it knows who to aim itself towards. If Nicholas Stoller and Doug Sweetland can do this good of a job with cartoony movies, then I can&apos;t wait to see what they have in store next for animation.like Captain Underpants, nice job Nick.",

The &quot;busy-bee&quot; exchange with the guy in the pet shop makes me crack-up every time.

Apart from it dragging slightly in the middle, Arthur Christmas was a wonderful film. The animation is absolutely breathtaking, it is all very colourful and beautifully modelled, and the soundtrack is so rousing it makes you want to get out your favourite Christmas Carols/Songs CD and sing along afterwards. The script is mostly witty, if more amusing than laugh-out-loud funny, and the story has a lot of charm and heart to it. The three best assets were the terrific characters, Arthur in particular, makes such a big impression with his likability and his wonderful jumper and I hope to see more of him in the future, the voice cast with a spirited James McAvoy, a jovial Jim Broadbent and a truly inspired Bill Nighy and the real sense of occasion, watching this movie you actually feel that it&apos;s Christmas. All in all, colourful and entertaining, I thoroughly enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;How many orgasms per mile can you get ?&quot; This is one of the catching tag lines of the movie &quot;Crash&quot;. Again Cronenberg delivers a dive into human psychic, the world of dark obsession, and twisted fantasy&apos;s. \n\nThe plot:\n\nA sexually frustrated couple starts experimenting with the outlines of anonymous sex. It is the husband James Ballard (James Spader) who gets into a car crash with Dr. Ellen Remington (Holly Hunter) and her husband. They crash frontally and both Ballard and Remington are seriously injured. Remington&apos;s husband dies while being launched from his seat through his own windshield into Ballards. Ballard ends up in the hospital, traumatized, trying to recover from his injuries. He gets into deeper contact with Helen Remington. Their mutual Crash-victim status brings them closer together, ultimately delivering them into the sump-oil-soaked world of the pathological Vaughan (Elias Koteas). Renegade scientist and leader of a strange subterranean group, Vaughan is only able to achieve sexual release by crashing into people on the motorways surrounding Heathrow airport. Getting sucked into his world, Ballard becomes obsessed with car crashes, and dives into the illegal world of &quot;thrill seeking&quot; and raw and hard (but mostly cold) sex.\n\nThe review:\n\nTo be quiet honest &quot;Crash&quot; is a very underestimated picture. First of all there are a serious amount of people who thought that the subject was laughable, and not to be taken serious, for how could you take something like this serious ? \n\nAfter crashing your car and being injured, having sex with the victim of a car-crash ? \n\nApart from the post-traumatic stress that can appear after such an incident it also triggers a lot of adrenaline, which is almost a self produced drug. Cronenberg cuts a subject which is still very much of a taboo, the &quot;thrill seeking taboo&quot;. You got a lot of so called thrill seekers now these days, which can result into ghost riding on the freeway, climbing on buildings without security etc. All in all the thrill seek element isn&apos;t that original. \n\nThis is where Cronenberg has looked for a thrill that rushes into a perverse sexual outburst. After the shock of crashing into a car, the adrenaline, the rush of the experience becomes so real, you feel so alive that you need to let it all out, which comes into the act of &quot;making love&quot;. Cronenberg is trying to paint the audience a picture of an event like this. \n\nBased on J.G. Ballards novel &quot;Crash&quot; which was quiet detached and cold, the director follows in style with the dark freeways of Canada, showing that even in your car you are not always save, and how a car can become the ultimate &quot;drive&quot; for pleasure. The problem with this film (like many others) is that it is so far out there that you either hate it or love it. The pacing is rather slow in the beginning and its hard to get into, if you don&apos;t understand the psychology that lies underneath the dialog. The movie has a solid script but the subject and material is not accessible for everybody. James Spader who often (he almost could be a stereotype) plays sexual frustrated protagonists (&quot;Sex,Lies,and Videotapes&quot;, &quot;Secretary&quot;, &quot;Speaking of Sex&quot;) delivers a terrific performance here. His distant and alienated acting fits perfectly into the dark en and sensual story, and doesn&apos;t come as a insincere or &quot;over the top&quot;. Some people felt that Koteas and Hunter performances where a little flat, but they have just the balance between low key and an over the top performance (Koteas more than Hunter). You got to keep in mind that these people are already deranged from the beginning. What you see is simply a drop falling into bucket that is overflowing. \n\nThe use of light and shadow is very subtle and excellently done by cinematographer Peter Suschitzky. He really knows how to pull you into a certain world, that LOOKS like ours but feels very different. In any case I can recommend the movie if you want to watch something different. A lot of people will not understand the weight this film carries, and therefore this movie will be underrated, or simply will be put aside as boring or unrealistic. THIS IS A MISTAKE,... don&apos;t put it away, watch it, and feel the awkwardness. The result ? \n\n&quot;Humans really are quiet weird creatures...&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "This is an epic masterpiece and is clearly a cut above most films in direction, acting, and cinematography. But what really sets it apart is that it connects the viewer to Bushido and has those values firmly at its core.\n\nThe sadistic tyrant who must be assassinated or Japan will turn once more to feudal warfare is told with verve and elan, but also with real dignity and a great sense of pace. The first hour is simply superb as we watch the recruiting and planning of the assassins. The second hour is a maelstrom of action with katanas flashing and impossible odds. I actually preferred the first half in the main, but absolutely no complaints with the action either.\n\nAll in all, this is simply, by far and away, the best action film of 2011 so far, but putting in a genre does not do it justice - for this reviewer, it is the most complete cinematic experience since Winter&apos;s Bone and is that rare animal these days - a film that looks, feels, and produces the sensation of film rather than TV.\n\nProbably one of the better films (Japanese or otherwise) I have seen this decade without exaggeration - it actually attempts to embody Bushido and understand the meaning and purpose of the Shogunate and the Samurai - plus Katanas - oh yes - lots and lots of katanas.....",

It rattles along at a fair old pace, screaming and shooting, and director Tony Scott goes out of his way to make every scene, every frame even, as stylish as possible. It&apos;s a mess of choppy editing, over the top dialogue and people screaming as they shoot each other while a pumping soundtrack plays over the proceedings.\n\nThe huge cast come in and out of the storyline, about bounty hunters going after some guys who&apos;ve stolen a massive haul, and it&apos;s all rather lightweight and nonsensical. The ensemble cast is good, but these are caricatures rather than real people, and larger than life doesn&apos;t really describe the huge egos and outlandish behaviour filling the screen. I&apos;ve never liked Knightley, but she&apos;s probably at her best here, given the chance to do something other than period dramas; Mickey Rourke is gravely and tough, continuing the career rehabilitation begun with SIN CITY; Christopher Walken shines in a supporting role.\n\nBut the script is all over the place and the attempts at comedy sit ill with the main thrust of the story – long, unnecessary segments including the Jerry Springer one just drag the film down and scream self-indulgence. By the end, I neither knew nor cared about any of the cardboard characters in this headache-inducing movie, just longing for it to be over.",

      "reviewBody": "For every icon, there is an unknown predecessor who paves the way. Before there was Kurt Cobain, there was Ian Curtis, lead singer of the post-punk band, Joy Division. 27 years after his tragic death, Curtis&apos; incredible contribution to music is finally being recognized in Anton Corbijn&apos;s film, &quot;Control.&quot; It&apos;s only fitting that Corbijn serve as director since it was his early photographs of Joy Division that reflected the band&apos;s dark, introspective songs. Corbijn went on to photograph and direct videos for such musical greats as U2, David Bowie, Depeche Mode, R.E.M. and Metallica.\n\nWith his first feature film, Corbijn avoids the pitfalls of many music video directors who inundate us with flashy and unnecessary edits and camera angles. Instead, he lets the stark black and white of the film tell the story of a lead singer tortured by epilepsy, guilt, depression and suicidal thoughts. The use of black and white also captures the factory town of Manchester, England in the late 1970s, a city crumbling under industrial and economic stress. Manchester has since rebounded and is once again thriving.\n\nCurtis is played by relative newcomer, Sam Riley, who&apos;s quiet and unassuming approach portrays an artist inspired by his heroes, David Bowie and Iggy Pop. At a chance meeting following a Sex Pistols concert, Curtis bonds with three fellow musicians to form the band.\n\nAs Joy Division begins to flourish, Ian&apos;s relationship with his young wife, Deborah, continues to distance itself. Academy Award nominee, Samantha Morton plays the confused wife trying to understand her husband&apos;s depressed soul. The film is based on Deborah Curtis&apos; autobiography, &quot;Touching From A Distance&quot;, so it comes as a surprise that Morton&apos;s character does not have more scenes in the movie.\n\nThe key to Control is understanding Curtis&apos; depression, which the film accomplishes to near perfection. As he battles epilepsy, the young singer lives in constant fear that his next seizure will be his last. His only option is to swallow a daily cocktail of prescription drugs with side effects so terrible, that most of us would rather tempt fate than endure the aftermath of the pills.\n\nIan&apos;s spirit is also tortured by overwhelming guilt brought on by an extra-marital affair with a part-time journalist, played by Romanian-born Alexandra Maria Lara.\n\nThe most telling scene comes when Ian records an in-studio track for the song &quot;Isolation.&quot; While Curtis stoically sings into the microphone, his band mates are distracted with the normal banter that typically occurs in a studio.\n\n&quot;Mother, I tried, please believe me. I&apos;m doing the best that I can. I&apos;m ashamed of the things I&apos;ve been put through. I&apos;m ashamed of the person I am.&quot; The lyrics seem to fall on deaf ears except for those of the sound engineer who refers to it as &quot;genius.&quot; But Ian&apos;s brilliance is also a desperate cry for help ignored by everyone in the studio.\n\nThe 27-year-old Riley does an excellent job of capturing Curtis&apos; aloofness on stage. Singers such as Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain and even the early years of Michael Stipe would often drift into the moment of the song. But when Curtis performed, he immersed himself into his own world where the music simply served as the soundtrack. Riley skillfully draws us into Ian&apos;s dark world with a range of subtle head movements and facial expressions to a whirling explosion of arm gyrations that came to personify the singer&apos;s stage performances.\n\nOverwhelmed with grief, shame and depression, Ian finally succumbs to his demons at the young age of 23. He left behind a wife, a child and a musical legacy that is finally receiving its just rewards nearly three decades later.\n\nFor those looking for a story solely about Joy Division, Control may not be for you. But for those seeking an intuitive perspective into the anguished spirit of one of the most influential alternative bands in history, you will certainly find it in this depressing but incredibly beautiful film.",

The direction and writing were very good and generally the pace of the film was perfect.\n\nI adore Simon Pegg in these roles, his ability to play the straight, flawed individual but make him the funniest man on screen is great and you&apos;re drawn to his story, no matter how ridiculous his predicament is. His best friend was hilarious, the setting of the London marathon was a great idea and Hank Azaria played his part well as the whole way through i wanted him to not get the girl and lose the race.\n\nIt&apos;s not as funny as Simon&apos;s other films but i really enjoyed it and it was well worth paying to see, in fact i&apos;d watch it again tomorrow as there was so many laughs throughout to hold my interest.\n\nOverall i love the Britishness of this film, the good guy and his basic life, it&apos;s not showy, or Hollywood it&apos;s just a simple film with comedy stars doing silly things and making us laugh, a perfect pick me up if you ask me.",

It&apos;s memorable, story-wise, for the radiation victims among the crew members. There are some really dramatic scenes involving that horrific event. Otherwise, it&apos;s a story of the sub&apos;s problems and the conflict between two captains.\n\nThe story starts slowly so you have to stick with it as it gets better and better as it goes on and rewarding enough to make you glad you hung in there for the whole 137 minutes. \n\nProfanity is minor and the Russian accents are handled well by the lead actors, led by Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson and Peter Sarsgaard.\n\nIt&apos;s not a great film, but it&apos;s good and interesting enough to recommend a rental, but not something I&apos;d watch numerous times. Those radiation scenes would be a little too grim to watch numerous times.",

      "name": "Not in the same league as the TV series but entertaining enough",
      "reviewBody": "A man is controlling people using their most embarrassing secrets against them. He is also torturing and killing people for sport. DCI Luther is put on the case after the disappearance of one of his victims. This makes Luther a target of the sadist and results in Luther being sentenced to a prison term. However, just because he&apos;s in jail doesn&apos;t mean Luther isn&apos;t on the case.\n\nBeing a fan of the TV series I was eagerly awaiting this. I wasn&apos;t expecting this film to be as good as the series: most films based on series aren&apos;t. Moreover, the quality of the series was due to being able to meticulously build a plot, create engagement with the characters and create tension through developments - a film wouldn&apos;t have time enough to do that. So I wasn&apos;t too disappointed when this didn&apos;t live up to the quality of the series.\n\nInstead of the usual Luther psychological tension and tight plot we have an unoriginal &quot;cop has to save a case while on the run from the law&quot; story. Add in some contrivances, some reasonably predictable plot developments, a cartoonish villain complete with about the fakest-looking hair ever and a reliance on style over substance at times and this is definitely not in the same league as the series.\n\nYet, despite all this, it&apos;s quite entertaining. Despite the 130-minute running time the film moves along at a brisk pace and is never dull. Initial plot setup is good, there are some surprises in the plot and the action scenes are great.\n\nIdris Elba is great in the lead role, as expected, and while Dermot Crowley (as Martin Schenk) was irritating in the series, here he is okay. Cynthia Erivo puts in a solid performance as DCI Odette Raine. On the other hand, Andy Serkis (and his fake hair) is irritating as the villain.\n\nOverall, not great but entertaining.",

      "reviewBody": "Just getting back from seeing 8 below, i am completely blown away by  several elements.  Firstly, right away you get glimpes of STUNNING scenery that continue  throughout the whole film. Beautiful artic landscapes frame the main  story line and on the big screen, it really takes your breath away.  The movie also is really able to give anyone an idea of what its like  to be in the artic, and really gave a clear picture of what being an  explorer was like. This added to the appeal of the movie, because its  not something most of us get to experience.   Although the acting has been in some cases been criticized, I believe  the actors fulfilled their purpose within the movie. They were able to  play their roles, without distracting from the dogs, which of course,  is the most important part. Paul Walker clearly comes across as a  strong animal lover, and displays this well. He becomes relatable to  any animal lovers, who will utimatly love this movie. As for the  others, the fulfilled their jobs, which is what matters. The character  of &quot;Cooper&quot; gave great comic relief, and &quot;Katie&quot; acted out the  predicable love story line well.  But of course, the most important aspect of this movie was the dogs. I  can hardly even begin to describe what a wonderful job they did. The  tricks preformed (as a dog lover and trainer) were some with great  difficulty. Ultimately, the way the dogs interact with each other and  are so compassionate, you really connect with them. The only way to  really experience this is to GO. the movie is AMAZING and a wonderful  family film. Although a part or two may be slightly scary, its still an  amazing picture for ALL to enjoy, it completely blew all of us a way.",

The plot was better, more focused, and a little more faithful to the Scooby Doo cartoons. One thing I appreciated here was that the director sensibly focused on Shaggy and Scooby, and that added to the film&apos;s charm, as nobody could resist Matthew Lilliard&apos;s goofiness as Shaggy. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini and Freddie Pinze Jnr were very good too, there are some decent jokes and there were some very good action sequences. Out of the supporting cast, Seth Green was a standout as Patrick, and Alicia Silverstone is likable too. My only complaints were that one or two of the monsters could have been designed better, and also some scenes felt a bit rushed. Other than that, an enjoyable film, with an 8/10. Bethany Cox.",

      "reviewBody": "I was certainly interested in seeing &quot;Dream House,&quot; since I just got back from seeing this couple in &quot;Betrayal.&quot; Let me tell you, from a strictly visual point of view, both of them are gorgeous, not to mention both wonderful actors on stage and on screen.\n\nI gather from reading a few reviews that this film suffers from the director having the final cut taken from him, a bad trailer, and being incorrectly advertised.\n\nI had never heard of it until I rented it. It&apos;s a thriller about a man named Will Attenton (Craig) who quits his job in order to spend time with his wife (Weisz) and two daughters. They have bought a place away from the city, but they didn&apos;t know that three of the previous four inhabitants of the house had been murdered by the husband and father.\n\nAfter some strange happenings, Will tries to find out what happened, which includes going to the institution where the father, Peter Ward, was sent after the murders. He was incapable of standing trial. What Will finds out is a huge shock.\n\nI actually liked this film, and I would have liked to have seen the director&apos;s cut, since apparently the actors were all up in arms about Jim Sheridan not being permitted to do what he wanted with the final product.\n\nI think for that reason, it&apos;s a tad confusing, nothing that a second viewing wouldn&apos;t solve. It&apos;s not as bad as it&apos;s been reviewed to be, and I think one poster was right - people were expecting a horror film and were disappointed.\n\nWell, I will never be disappointed about not seeing a horror film. And I&apos;m a sucker for Daniel Craig.",

ARRahman - WOW!!! He made the Kaise mujhe song echo in all the audience&apos;s heart as they leave the theater. Its like &quot;Every night in my dreams&quot; song from titanic.

A world populated by the shallowest, opportunistic bunch of ignoramuses the world has ever know. How can art come out of that? I think that when it does it&apos;s just an accident of Casablanca proportions. Robert Altman who knows a thing or two about it tells us the horror story with the most everyday approach. Tim Robbins is perfect as that empty designer clothed excecutive with a tinge of self awareness. I had to take a shower after the film was over and remove myself from that world.",

One night, Sam and his best friend Donnie (Michael Shannon) give a ride to a hitchhiker that threatens Donnie with a pocketknife; however Sam reacts and stabs the stranger and dumps him on the road.\n\nSam is affected by the incident and is convinced by Lynn and his mother Daisy (Kathy Baker) to join their church and he is baptized. Sam finds a straight job in construction. He is well succeeded and when he meets a preacher from Africa, he decides to visit the continent. Sam travels to Northern Uganda and South Sudan many times and builds an orphanage for the victims of the cruel Lord&apos;s Resistance Army (LRA). Further, he fights whenever necessary and becomes a legend known as The Machine Gun Preacher.\n\n&quot;Machine Gun Preacher&quot; is a film tailored to Gerard Buttler about the fantastic but unfortunately not well known biography of Sam Childers, an addicted troublemaker drug-dealer biker that changes totally his life and becomes the only hope for thousand of orphans in Africa. \n\nThe story and the screenplay are engaging with a perfect combination of drama and action. The only thing that irritates me is douchbags that write that this film like is a Christian propaganda. This is a true story and can be found everywhere in Internet and has nothing to do with propaganda, but reality and redemption. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Redenção&quot; (&quot;Redemption&quot;)",

Fantastic.\n\nI sincerely hope this fine film is given an honest opportunity to succeed in the U.S. We don&apos;t need a Disney remake in English with updated pop songs. This charming import is the real deal.\n\nAs a teacher I always trust the sometimes brutal honesty that high school students express about films and music.

However, the ride wouldn&apos;t be same without the supporting characters; all of them detailed really well. The ride wouldn&apos;t also be same without the Rocking music of Amit Trivedi. And How can I not mention Vikas Bahl here? Quality Direction;Quality Screenplay. Too many names; too little space. With Big names such as Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane involved in Editing and Production as well; the product had to be Top Notch.\n\nA movie that would require the audience to connect with the Lead Character; eventually got me connected to all the characters, including Vijay played by Rajkummar Rao. I am sure most guys (at-least in their heads) can relate to that lad.\n\nSome scenes were executed perfectly. Some Punchlines were too good. Kudos to the whole Team.\n\nKangana gave it all in this movie. She was immersed deep in the character. Her dialogue delivery;her posture;her expressions. One of the finest performances I have seen by any Bollywood Actress in Long time.\n\nFrom the right perspective; you can see that Queen has many messages. Highlights the issue that women do face in this country. Don&apos;t tell me i am wrong ; THEY DO.\n\nOverall; A MUST WATCH. Salute to the QUEEN.",

      "reviewBody": "Let me start by saying that The Cat Returns is not the best of Ghibli and Miyazaki had almost nothing to do with it. If Miyazaki had directed or even written it, the film would have been as great as Totoro or Kiki. This movie is pretty much Whisper of the Heart as a Spirited Away style fantasy.\n\nThe story is as follows: A normal girl named Haru is transported to the world of cats to marry a cat prince who she saved from a speeding truck. That&apos;s basically all that I can tell without giving away the film. For those of you who loved Whisper, Baron is back big time. It was great to see Baron have a much larger role as a hero. The `stray&apos; cat from Whisper is also back and fatter than ever.\n\nThough some Ghibli fans will be disappointed, those who are cat-lovers will fall in love with the film. The film&apos;s flaw lies in that the story moves along a bit too fast for my taste. Just don&apos;t go expecting a film on the same level as Spirited Away or Mononoke and you&apos;ll have a great time. Grade: A-.\n\n Rated PG for frightening scenes, brief sensuality, and language. Suggested for ages 10 and up.",

      "reviewBody": "I had actually liked the remake of Wes Craven&apos;s Hills Have Eyes, which was shown here last year. Directed by Alxandre Aja, it was top notch violence and gore which actually sent a chill, because the victims were an innocent family out for a holiday, and to see them getting systematically deeper into trouble, somehow makes it rather horrific to sit through.\n\nWhile its predecessor was shown here with cuts, The Hills Have Eyes II is shown here in its full gory glory. However you wonder, just where did all the blood and gore had gone. Written by father and son team Wes and Jonathan Craven, the follow up movie (also a remake of the sequel to the original) seemed to be lacking in flavour and spirit. Sure the mutants are back, but there&apos;s very little space given to set them up, or enough time for you to identify and distinguish one from the other.\n\nDid director Martin Weisz opt to play it safe? There&apos;s tension built, but nothing too riveting. The narrative is simple and straightforward, without much thought into trying to capture the X-factor why the original had worked somehow. Attempting to shock just for shock&apos;s sake, the movie opens with the birth of a child, in the most un-Discovery Channel manner, before introducing us to the victims, I mean, characters, and a short scene to link the events from its predecessor.\n\nAgain the military&apos;s dirty hands are in this one. Gone are the family, and in comes a small squad of National Guard trainees. It&apos;s soldiers versus A-bomb mutants, so the numbers come in handy to build up the body count. But in fact, none of them died in any creative manner. It&apos;s the usual hack jobs, and more uninterestingly, through the use of their carbines. Boring, and I guess too many movies outdoing one another in the creative death department, has taken its toil on this one, where simpleness and sure death like falling from great heights without the camera flinching, go unappreciated. Truth is, you know that it&apos;s a camera trick, and boy, are there a number of recognizable indoor shots for this outdoor movie, that makes it look cheap.\n\nBy the time it takes for these rookie soldiers to complete their training to the dark side and become cold killers (fighting for their own survival), you&apos;ll be more than in a hurry to head for the exit. To enjoy this movie, the usual leave your brains at the door cliché applies. Just make sure someone doesn&apos;t take a real machete and help you put it there.",

      "reviewBody": "How is it until now I&apos;d never seen this gem of a movie? The film is directed by notorious, and equally mysterious English street artist, Banksy. It uses many, many pieces of stock footage from a French shop keeper named Thierry Guetta (A man who would later be known as Mr. Brainwash), who follows many street artists all over the world, capturing their art on film before it is taken down. He soon comes across the man himself, capturing his art, and even attempts to make a documentary centered around the art, and the artists (Even though he has never made a film before). But Banksy decides to turn the tables, and instead focuses his own documentary on the life of Guetta. Why? As Banksy himself puts it, &quot;He&apos;s a more interesting person than I am.&quot; An inspired decision on his part. Theirry Guetta really is a fascinating person, a man obsessed with taking a video camera everywhere he goes, and capturing these artists at work, having strong senses of passion for both. He is also a witty person, sometimes the things he says feel a little too odd to be true, but believe it. The film&apos;s portrait of the man is rather eccentric, and energetic.\n\nA lot of this is to the credit of film editors Tom Fulford, and Chris King, whose editing and pacing is pitch perfect, always leaving proper delivery for some rather humorous things to occur, and never straying away from giving the world of art its own adequate time in the spotlight. The film really is a thought provoker, sometimes the life of the man can make you question &quot;Is this for real?&quot; I guess the whole film is really summed up by one phrase: &quot;Time will tell whether I&apos;m a rabbit, or a turtle.&quot; Sounds silly now, but once you hear it, the gears in your head start right up. It&apos;s a passionately crafted movie of a man with nothing but passion for what he does.\n\nExit Through the Gift Shop is a diamond in the rough, one that I give **** out of ****",

The story is interesting and Julianne Moore&apos;s performance is sincere but you can&apos;t help but think that something is missing. The clever twist is good but they could have easily expanded the storyline and made it more &quot;something&quot;.\n\nGood but not great, &quot;The Forgotten&quot; seems to lack its own identity due to the derivative nature of the storyline which needed a bit of assistance from Fox Mulder.",

The exercises of exploration of Dorian gray past are only good intentioned.\n\nIn short, not a bad film but sort of childish exploration of a lot of ifs only for surprise or impress or seduce or be, apparently, cool.\n\nBut, not exactly Oscar Wild and, for me, it is not happy option.\n\nSure, new century, new states. But Portrait of Dorian Gray is more than thriller/ horror/ Gothic. Or , exactly the deep subtance, in this adaptation, just missing."

      "reviewBody": "How does one review &quot;Jackass 3D&quot;? The tertiary installment in MTV&apos;s prank and stunt franchise is basically immune to criticism because you get exactly what you pay for. Love it or hate it, &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; accomplishes just about everything it sets out to; in effect, Johnny Knoxville scores a goal on an empty net.\n\nI am the anomaly, but I&apos;d wager next to no one is &apos;on the fence&apos; about whether or not they should see this film. They either contributed to the massive $50 million opening weekend box office cume, or they immediately dismissed it. In my case, however, having never seen the &quot;Jackass&quot; films wasn&apos;t a conscious snub. Believe it or not, there just always seemed to be something better to watch.\n\nBut mine&apos;s not a high horse. I sought out and watched &quot;Jackass&quot; and &quot;Jackass: Number Two&quot; the week prior to my first theater experience with the series, and I&apos;m glad I did. After all, I grew up on &quot;America&apos;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; and throughout high school religiously followed the English hidden camera show &quot;Trigger Happy TV.&quot; &quot;Jackass&quot; is not as clever as the latter, but by measure of unbridled chutzpah, Knoxville and Co. are the reigning kings.\n\nLike a Victorian freak show or museum of oddities, the often self-destructive experiments of the &quot;Jackass&quot; crew are the guilty pleasures of our generation. There&apos;s something almost gladiatorial about watching the elaborate dangers these brave idiots subject themselves to. Man vs. bull, man vs. mule, man vs. man—our fascination with competition, spectacle, and injury is nothing new.\n\n&quot;Jackass 3D&quot; being my first chance to observe others&apos; response to these shenanigans, I was most amazed by the two-pronged reaction the audience had to the physical trauma the performers sustained. A given stunt would be executed, typically resulting in its participant doubling over in pain. The crowd laughed, as they&apos;d been cued to. The film would then play back the moment in slow motion and suddenly everyone would groan or sharply inhale. Though we paid to laugh at people injuring themselves, what&apos;s more interesting is our ability to empathize with the depiction of human pain. That the &quot;Jackass&quot; films achieve both is not an insignificant feat.\n\nThis isn&apos;t the definitive &quot;Jackass&quot; experience, however. Having watched all three films in the span of a single week, I did discern a distinct arc that left me somewhat letdown with Knoxville&apos;s most recent effort. &quot;Jackass: Number Two&quot; improved upon the original with a more polished, professional look, and more elaborate and inventive stunts. It gave the genuine impression that the crew was pushing its boundaries and trumping itself wherever possible. That same sense of pioneering is largely missing from &quot;Jackass 3D.&quot; The glasses- gimmick seems to supplant genuine innovation in their routine, and on the whole it feels slapdash in comparison to the conceptual genius of its prequel.\n\nBut what survives in &quot;Jackass 3D,&quot; and what ultimately endeared me to the franchise is its creativity. Where it won me over was not in the painful payoff of each trick, but rather in the setup. The use of the camera to disorient, spotlight, and surprise is what really makes the series sing, and the trilogy is full of epiphanic moments of hilarity. &quot;Jackass&quot; has and always will be a potpourri of comedic elements, not all of which directly appeal to my specific sensibilities, but the variety is essential and the whole is somehow more than the sum of its parts.\n\nI only wish &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; had more of the entrepreneurial spirit that so distinguished the second film. It may not be ambitious, but hey, a goal made on an empty net still counts.",

      "reviewBody": "Now here is a modern-day animated film that is hard to classify. It&apos;s part film noir, part fantasy, part comedy, part Indiana Jones adventure, part Thin Man detective, on and on. One thing for sure: although kids might like it, this movie is geared more for adults. Even older adults as some of the humor is referenced by classic movies.\n\nI doubt if this was a hit movie probably because of the above. Animated films need to be geared toward young kids who want to see it, and then get their parents to take them to the theater. I&apos;m not complaining, just explaining why some of you may not have heard of this film. I heard about it by accident, since it got very little publicity.\n\nMore than the geared-toward adults-dialog, what fascinated me were the visuals. I read where other reviewers here on IMDb downgrade the artwork but I disagree. This is beautifully drawn with magnificent colors that are not bold and bright, Although most animated films of today feature bright and bold colors, which look fantastic, this looked good, too, because of the richness of the colors. It&apos;s hard to describe; you have to see it. It just looks different, but very pleasing to my eyes.\n\nOverall, the story was only so-so and sometimes lagged in the first half of it, but I get the feeling this DVD will rise in my ratings as I see it multiple times.\n\nIf you are looking for an animated film and story that is different, look no further.",

      "reviewBody": "Jim Davies (Christian Bale) is back on the streets of LA after six years in the army. He finished up as a Ranger before being honourably discharged. Suffering with extreme PTSD, he hits town with his buddy Mike (Freddy Rodriguez). Jim is trying to start a career in law enforcement, but his psychological injuries are proving an obstacle. He feels that he has no hope if he does not get a career in law enforcement, and he is worried about how he is going to get his wife-to-be over the border and living legally out of Mexico. Mike, meanwhile, is unemployed and his wife (Eva Longoria) is on the warpath. The film follows the pair as they drive around the city, drinking, smoking weed and engaging in medium-level criminality, ostensibly handing out resumes for Mike to get a job. All while Jim&apos;s psychological state worsens.\n\nChristian Bale&apos;s frightening performance as Jim Davies is the towering point for this film, the directorial debut of the man who wrote the screenplay for the superb &quot;Training Day&quot;. While Bale&apos;s performance is manic, it tends to veer close to being over-the-top at times, while Freddy Rodriguez&apos;s does more so. It is not helped by some dodgy script writing, which is surprising seeing as how it&apos;s coming from the man behind &quot;Training Day&quot;. The dialogue could have been better. It sways too much into hip-hop parlance with &quot;dawg&quot; thrown out a bit much and some of it is cringe-worthy. I&apos;m not saying people don&apos;t talk like the way the men do in this film, but it just came across as a bit pantomime, and together with the scenes where the two leads lose the run of themselves a little it was detrimental to the overall impact. Overall this is a real heavy-hitter. The film pulls us in to all this anger and misery and bludgeons us with the baseball bat until it is covered in blood and snaps in two. In that sense it does a commendable job, but it did not seem to realise it&apos;s potential. All it&apos;s missing is a bit more plot focus and some fine tuning in the script and character writing.",

      "reviewBody": "Very funny movie. Of the recent &apos;stoner&apos; flicks, this is probably one of the best. (Probably second in my book to Dude Where&apos;s My car?) Ejoyable, entertaining, and weird characters. Dave Chappell is hilarious as always. There are a ton of cameos by great and well known comedians throughout the piece, all paying their homage to the great herb.\n\nI myself am not a pot smoker but laughed my rear off anyways, even if I didn&apos;t get all of the &apos;inside&apos; stuff that others may refer too. Chappell is great playing several outlandish characters in the movie. The situations they get themselves into are great and even better how they get out of them.\n\nThere is ample potty humor as well as pot humor to boot. Well worth the rental fee and your time.",

As most encounter, the years couldn&apos;t go by fast enough for my young self, constantly wishing to be older and wiser. Now is the time I look back. I deeply appreciate this film because it cherishes the beauty of a child&apos;s imagination. The animation leaves me awestruck at its beautiful simplistic style of stop motion. I cannot help but by transported back into my ever too short childhood along with the little girl and the Prince. I hope more teenagers and adults will stumble upon this piece of art because it is such a good reminder to cherish our imaginations amidst our mundane every day life.",

He reinvented the tough guy. He&apos;s got a persona that few have on the big silver screen. The fact that Hollywood turned their back on him is nothing short of a crime. Well - he&apos;s back and he&apos;s doing what he does best - and I for one am thankful. I just recently saw another movie he&apos;s done called &quot;Get the Gringo&quot;. Another amazing movie steeped in great dialog, action and classic Gibson lines and scenes.\n\nThis movie is every father&apos;s nightmare. A child or yours has gotten themselves intertwined with some pretty bad dudes and you&apos;re the only person that can fix it. Gibson delivers on all levels - providing a character that isn&apos;t completely foreign - but new enough to be interesting and engaging. William H. Macy as always delivers some great scenes - and the only disappointment was the lack of on-screen time devoted to Macy and Gibson&apos;s character development. Short - but effective. Erin Moriarty was a breath of fresh air - and her character and acting worked well with Gibson&apos;s.\n\nThis movie is classic Gibson. Great dialog, story and acting. 8 out of 10!"

      "reviewBody": "Since the days of Chak De India, judging his grace &amp; his stupendous acting skills, I am a huge fan of Shah Rukh Khan. A man of substance, he shows his skills in every film through his strong dialogue delivery &amp; a firm grip over the emotional phenomena of the film. Every film he does, he makes it new for his audience &amp; that is what makes him a stand-out actor. \n\nJust few hours back, I caught up with his new film released today &apos;Chennai Express&apos; directed by the Singham &amp; Golmaal director Rohit Shetty, co-starring Deepika Padukone. It showed the King of Romance in a dynamic never-seen-before avatar &amp; some fun-rolled laughter &amp; Rohit Shetty style action. \n\nNot much of surprise, the film touches all the genres of Bollywood completing a circle of entertainment. The film is the mixture of both: humour as well as some serious action. Frankly, I only liked Shetty for Golmaal &amp; Singham. I found that mostly his films lacked sensibility &amp; displayed some mindless insensitive action. But the fact that Shah Rukh Khan is starring in it made me really look into Chennai Express. Because as far as I know SRK, he is one of intelligent brains in Bollywood &amp; knows completely well what he is up to. \n\nNot deviating from Chennai Express, I would like to tell about the plot. The story is about Rahul, a 40 year unmarried man, who lives with his grandparents in Mumbai. After his grandfather&apos;s death, Rahul embarks on a journey to Goa but a series of confusions &amp; misunderstanding, he finds himself in Chennai Express, a train that brings a big turn in the life of Rahul leading him to the place where he is destined to be. \n\nFrustrated of his misfortune about not being able to go to Goa, Rahul meets Meenama, a South Indian girl from Kumban village in Chennai. She happens to be the pivotal part of the film that changes the monotony of Rahul&apos;s life. Rahul witnesses the ticket checker of the train being thrown in the waters from running train by the Tamil goons who happen to have kidnapped Meenama, thus being the only witness to the incident. Rahul is plunged into the world where he is being pestered, troubled &amp; led into some humorous mishap. Shetty has depicted all of this in funny way that audience find themselves having the best time of their lives. \n\nChennai Express is sheer entertainment with fun-filled comedy all over. There is action, romance &amp; humour throughout the film. It will leave smiles on everyone&apos;s faces when they leave the theatre. It is very impressive and unlike all Rohit Shetty films, it has the powerful element of emotion, the element which Indian directors use to uplift their standard of cinema. The songs are combination of foot-tapping numbers as well as some melodiously extravagant songs. If you have caught up with all Rohit Shetty films, this one you will be the most satisfied with. The first time collaboration of Rohit Shetty- SRK duo will undoubtedly set the box office registers ringing.",

But then I saw the lame TV spots and decided against going, and the reviews it received didn&apos;t exactly give incentive for seeing it either.  But I still always sort of had the urge to see it, and I finally got my chance, with decent results.\n\n&quot;Out of Time&quot; is the type of thriller that tries hard, but still comes up short.  There were no horrible aspects of this movie, nothing that stands out as being horribly dumb or even horribly unorginal.  Yet everything seems mediocre.  Denzel&apos;s acting was great, but other cast members occasionally seemed a little lost.  The direction was also pretty good, but Carl Franklin seemed to have a little trouble pacing the movie, with a couple scenes seeming completely out of place.  The music also, by Graeme Revell, was pretty good, but wasn&apos;t exemplary or especially dramatic.  The cinematography was good, but didn&apos;t really stand out, while the screenplay also lagged in places.  Plus, the story was original, but not original enough to really keep you guessing.\n\nYet the movie does create suspense quite well and Denzel saves the movie from complete mediocrity.\n\nFinal Grade: B."

      "reviewBody": "Heavenly Creatures, based on a true story, is written, directed and produced by Peter Jackson of Lord of the Rings fame. This film captivates, catching you off guard.\n\nJackson sets the audience up in the beginning by focusing on the tranquil, predictable world of 1950s Christchurch, New Zealand. Before long, the peaceful world is exposed for what it is, repressed. \n\nTwo teenage girls, Juliet and Pauline, befriend each other at a private girl&apos;s school. They find out they have a lot in common. Sharing a world of fantasy and make believe, leads to an insane reversal. Their fantasy world becomes their reality.\n\nOnce they cross that line, their otherwise superficial, conventional world is turned upside down. All the repressed dysfunction surfaces. Ironically, Juliet&apos;s mother is a psychotherapist who doesn&apos;t see her daughter&apos;s neurosis becoming a psychosis. Eventually, Pauline and Juliet go off the deep end, drowning in their make believe world. By the end of the film, they do the unthinkable.\n\nKate Winslet is superb as Juliet. The rest of the cast is outstanding. Peter Jackson does a masterful job of capturing the essence of 1950s religious repression in New Zealand. It could be England or American in the 1950s. Heavenly Creatures will appeal to anyone who enjoys psychological twists and turns."

( With the exception of Alexa Vega and Courtney Jines). It had some funny lines but not as witty as the first two. The noir style opening would have gone completely over the heads of the main target audience. Sylvester Stallone was good as were the cameo appearances by George Clooney, Elijah Wood, Bill Paxton and Steve Buscemi.\n\nThe computer generated sets looked tacky. And the bald wig on one of the Stallone characters looked like a prop from a small town repertory theatre. I  was looking forward to this but I was very disappointed. It was made by the bean counters not the creative people."

Action sequences are solid with some nice gore - straight from the pages of grant Morrisons comic run and it&apos;s good to see a villain like jigsaw on screen - played brilliantly by Dominic west.\n\nAll in all it&apos;s a leave your brain at the door decent actioner that you feel with the right budget and better writers could of been an 8 or 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "This film spoke to me for a couple of reasons. I was a college student during the time depicted in this film, and I remember very well how naïve many young women were about how manipulative, conniving, and dangerous some men could be. I&apos;m fortunate that nothing happened to me, because I certainly took some risks in situations where I should have known better. And then when something like a sexual crime did happen to a young woman, law enforcement didn&apos;t always take it seriously. They often thought the girl was asking for it because, for example, she was wearing a short skirt and walking alone at night.\n\nThe pacing of this film is deliberate and intense, and it switches back and forth between time frames and victims. I found it a little annoying at first, but it all made sense at the end. I thought Anna Kendrick and Daniel Zovatto played their roles extremely well. Zovatto came across as creepy AF. A few points are fictionalized, of course, and I&apos;m not sure how much. I did some reading about Rodney Alcala, and the way he was apprehended is essentially accurate. If you can deal with the slow pace of this film, it&apos;s well worth the watch.",

Tom Waits is mocking with Iggy Pop in a way that it&apos;s hard to believe they ever can talk to each other again. Bill Murray is pulling the leg of the hip hop movement and the movement finds that funny. Cate Blanchett is on a genial level playing the double part of the filmstar and her jealous cousin.\n\nJim Jarmusch can&apos;t be beaten. The dialogue seems to be mostly improvised, but the concept is not. Every short chapter here has a meaning and gives us something to think about. The films are in black and white, like coffee and cigarettes and that still is, and will always be, a way of pushing things harder. This is very much comedy and very much serious.",

      "reviewBody": "There is a little sub genre of horror that involves people with guns vs. monsters. The most famous are of course Aliens, but there are few others (28 days later is another example).\n\nSoldiers are the people of our society to whom we give the latest technology for killing, train them in this art to basically make monsters out of men and then their job is defend civilization against the monsters (where it is Osoma Bin Ladin or Werewolves, it doesn&apos;t matter).\n\nHaving said or that, this low budget, but well made horror flick has a squad of soldiers wandering around Scotland on a routine training mission, only to find out they are really there as bait for werewolves.\n\nLots of guns, guts (sausages) and gory glory. Heaps of pop culture references, fine acting, some scares, but lots of action. The werewolves are cool, the military action is authentic enough, and the analogy of the pack of werewolves and the squad of soldiers is a good one. It never had theatrical release in America, but did very well for itself in the UK.\n\nOverall a good movie, with some flaws such as plot twists either being obvious (but then I tend to get most of them right away) or just silly and much of the time they are playing the movie for laughs when the audience is more into the tension and is there for the scare.\n\nYou won&apos;t see many horror films like this, so if you like soldier movies, horror movies, low budget movies or just want something a little different, see it.",

Ruben carefully builds a creepy atmosphere, relying on brief glances, moments of silence and quietly expressive performances (especially by Julia Roberts) to help the viewer understand that, behind the image of a perfect couple, something is really wrong. Unfortunately, after Roberts escapes from her husband, the movie turns into a strictly by-the-numbers thriller, where you can predict almost every development of the script. It&apos;s a visually polished movie, though, and the very good performances give it a strong psychological center that keeps it above-average.",

The acting could have been better, certainly with that cast, but again it wasn&apos;t all that bad either. My wife and I did enjoy this sci-fi thriller so no complaining here. Could it have been better? For sure, but that&apos;s the case with almost everything so just take a chill pill and try to enjoy a movie with its flaws.",

      "reviewBody": "Like many long time fans of the games, I was certainly not impressed by the trailer for this film. While I was pleased to see plenty of faithful references to the games (Itchy, Tasty, Lisa Trevor) I immediately got the impression that this would be a loosely based take on the first two Resident Evil games.\n\nI can&apos;t say I hated this movie, necessarily. There seemed to be some effort at capturing the spirit of the games, and unlike the usual Resident Evil movies, this one seemed like it was trying to be scary. Atmosphere and tone were relatively good. Director Johannes Roberts said he wanted Raccoon City to feel bleak and deserted, and he definitely succeeded, for the most part. Some of the sets felt genuine and right out of the games. Then other moments just suffered. The famous foyer of the mansion and the lobby of the police department looked like poorly rendered cgi images! Plus there were a few moments where it felt like it was trying to tell you it was a &quot;video game movie,&quot; which sadly came across as silly. At some points this film felt like a tribute to movies like The Shining. At other points it felt like an Uwe Boll flick.\n\nAll of the monster action is fun enough. This movie offers a different take on the spread of the virus, opting for a slow spread of the zombie infection (Hey, there&apos;s something up with your eye!) as opposed to arriving and finding the city overrun with zombies. I thought that was interesting enough.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie suffers from pacing and writing issues. The more you think about it after seeing it, the less it will make sense. Some things are over explained, or not explained enough. Plus there are many deviations from the story of the video games. Normally this should be expected, but I suspect that many fans will find some of them to be intentionally done, and there by off putting, if not insulting. I&apos;ll be the first to tell you that the movie could have done without the subplot about Clair and Chris&apos;s childhood.\n\nCast wise it was ok enough. I know the internet certainly bashed the casting choices, but they did what they could. The script wasn&apos;t always kind to them though, which led to some cringy moments here and there. (What&apos;s a chat room?!?) Leon being the object of lots of comic relief was certainly distracting. We get it. He&apos;s a rookie!\n\nSo if you&apos;re like me and go into it with low expectations, maybe you&apos;ll have fun. Just don&apos;t think too hard about it. If you&apos;re a long time fan of the game franchise and bummed out, fortunately for you the remake of the Resident Evil 2 game was awesome!",

      "reviewBody": "The strength of this movie is the study in character contrast and development, with the added attractions of a historical setting and the soaring, ethereal musical score of Evangelos Papathanassiou.\n\nThe film is anchored in the character study of the introspective, brooding, and complex persona of Harold Abrahams, wonderfully portrayed by Ben Cross. Here is a man with all of the outward trappings of success:  academic achievement, unexcelled athletic ability, wildly popular with his peers, yet tortured by an inbred inferiority complex and driven to lash out at the world in response.  In the end, he conquers his inner demons through hard work, sacrifice, understanding of his fellow man, and the love of a good woman, to whom he opens his heart.  I found myself thinking that Harold Abrahams is the kind of man I would want as my best friend, yet at the same time would find hard to become close with and relate to.\n\nIan Charleston&apos;s character (Eric Liddell) is a bit more one-dimensional.  He is the archetypical Good Man, faithful to his family, his country, his friends, and his God.  And in the end he triumphs through sheer force of will and by tapping that reservoir of inner strength that sustains him.  As the crusty coach Sam Mussambini says, &quot;He&apos;s a gut runner.  Digs deep...&quot;.\n\nIt&apos;s a bit of a pity that the movie, long though it is, could not have delved more deeply into the other characters&apos; background.  Lord Andrew Lindsey is particularly appealing as Harold&apos;s and Eric&apos;s faithful friend who gives up his spot in his specialty race (the 400 m) to allow Eric a chance at the gold.  Sybil Gordon is wonderful as Harold&apos;s love interest who tries to draw him out of his lonely world of bitterness and resentment and self-hatred (&quot;You ran like a God.  I was proud of you...&quot;, even after Harold loses a race for the first time in his life to a more determined Eric). Even some of the American competitors, who are only peripherally portrayed in the concluding segments, lend some color.  Jackson Scholtz&apos; reaching out to Eric Liddell gives one the sense that he knows the greatness of spirit that quietly resides in this unassuming Scotsman.\n\nIts a wonderful story wonderfully told, and when its over you find yourself longing for it to continue, to see how these characters we&apos;ve come to know over the previous two hours will turn out in the rest of their lives.  Alas, the story of their lives is noted only in subtitles as the film closes."

      "name": "Jarmusch as humanist; one of the best films of 1991",
      "reviewBody": "Jim Jarmusch, a director who never neglects to find the time for the little moments, glances, exchanges in dialog, that bring out the better (or lesser) in people, puts his skills to full force in Night on Earth. Another in his several episodic-style films, this time he pushes forward his great use of pure conversational, and emotional, comedy, as well as drama. In fact, this may be one of the best from the 90&apos;s of that kind that came out (i.e. mixing comedy and drama to create some bittersweet vignettes). Inspiration of course pours out from European cinema, but even in the American segments there&apos;s a sense of genuine pathos with the characters. Sometimes one style was kept totally consistent, with all comedy in episode four or all tragedy in episode five, or the two styles went back and forth like in the first two. The third remains the more ambiguous, and maybe more uncomfortable, segment of the bunch, and even if it might be the lesser of them all it&apos;s still fascinating due to the actors.\n\nBut to get back to the humanism that comes on in the film, it&apos;s not something at all uncommon to Jarmusch&apos;s work. In Ghost Dog it goes a long way to help us not be too left out of the world of Whitaker&apos;s character, or it makes every lady seem all the more odd and unique in Broken Flowers. Here since it is met with a more realistic approach, with situations that could be happening right now at night in these cities, I&apos;m almost reminded of Renoir. Particularly in the second segment in New York, where there&apos;s the perfect divide between lightness and over-the-top- lightness being in Armin Mueller-Stahl&apos;s performance as Helmut (German ex-clown turned un-knowing cabbie) and Giancarlo Esposito&apos;s performance as Yo-yo. Maybe it&apos;s because scenes like these usually wouldn&apos;t make it into &apos;mainstream&apos; fare, but a sequence like this showcases some great dialog on both sides (and when Rosie Perez comes in, all bets are off). Stahl especially makes the scenes work in-particular as he almost seems to inhabit this person of an outsider in the (taken for granted) amazing space of NYC.\n\nTo say which one was my overall favorite might be a little picky, as every one of them had something to offer differently. There was the cute, and slightly awkward, scenes with Ryder and Rowlands (maybe one of Ryder&apos;s few gems in her career too, mostly based on style). The segment in Paris, again, may make one feel a little uncomfortable, but that might be the point. And I loved how Beatrice Dalle&apos;s role went effortlessly between the bizarre and the almost ironically compassionate. It&apos;s also the segment which provides a little extra bitter of a touch by way of the Ivory Coast cabbie, however it does come to pass as being about two outsiders thrust into a strange little moment in life. Roberto Benigni&apos;s segment was drop dead funny, which is surprising considering the hit or miss ways of Jarmusch&apos;s comedy. But Benigni is so outrageous in his long monologue its no wonder what becomes of his passenger. It&apos;s a terrific mix between Benigni&apos;s voracious style of fast (but not too fast) speech, and a sort of silent-film kind of comedy, likely out of Buster Keaton or something. And all of this is accentuated by a carefully controlled mis en scene of driving (which is always visually endearing), where right when you&apos;re expecting there to be a cut it waits one or two extra seconds. It&apos;s a film with a sweet rhythm that doesn&apos;t drag like in Jarmusch at his worst.\n\nThe last segment, oddly enough, could be a downer for some. It was for me, until I decided to watch it a second time. This combines the frustration seen in bits in the other segments regarding a city life that bogs down on its inhabitants, and the sympathy that can come out even behind the tough veneer of lives lived with a shell protecting them from idiots. When it comes time for Matti Pellonpaa&apos;s monologue, it makes for the most touching, and a close-call for most emotionally striking, thing Jarmusch has ever written, put together by his portrayal. What&apos;s interesting even more so is how the film, despite this bleak story, doesn&apos;t seem to end too much on that note, due to the last little bit between Mika and Avi, the drunk passenger. In fact, after watching this a second time, I got to get the sense of what the film might be about- getting past that separation between a driver doing his job and a passenger with their own issues. It&apos;s also a small ruby of a communication fable, of how lives in different cities and countries may be of course different in speech and attitude and dress, but have similar plights to deal with in the dead of night.",

Laura Linney is fine in this very small cast, though I question whether she was right for the role. Too upright and groomed for a middle aged war widow. Not her fault, but she was meant to be the foil for the son who is bright and full of potential and she is offering to bring him to Portsmouth to follow in her footsteps.\n\nBeautifully shot, lots of external shots and small cast show off the small budget But the acting is superb. Definitely bound to be a favourite in the boutique cinema.",

Storm Reid is the main lead and she gives a great performance. Her character doesn&apos;t have a great relationship with her mother and she isn&apos;t exactly being great to her. Despite that, the movie gets you to really root for her because you see her desperation and regret once her mother is missing.\n\nI do have a couple of gripes that make me enjoy it less than Searching (2018).\n\n1. I find it hard to believe that the police wouldn&apos;t have access to the emails needed for the investigation.\n\n2. Once the reveal happens, I question a lot of the overly complicated plan and the believability of it.\n\n3. I also can&apos;t believe Javier has a 2.8 star out of 5 for his service. That guy is an MVP!\n\nJust like Searching (2018), the mystery keeps you gripped with every twist and turn. It&apos;s a great mystery worth watching!",

      "reviewBody": "No, the story resolution itself isn&apos;t stupid. I&apos;m talking about the ridiculous over-the-top theatrics that turn this otherwise intelligent story into a carnival, heavy on the cotton candy. All subtlety is lost, and we&apos;re given a razmatazz final scene that beats the point home harder than getting your head slammed into a ceramic sink so hard that it breaks (the sink). Twice. By the way, that&apos;s what happens to a character, and the character still manages to walk away like nothing happened.\n\nThat little sink example is the perfect illustration of how this movie, which initially began so well I spent the first hour whispering to myself, &quot;how did I never hear of this awesome movie before?&quot; falls apart in the last 30 minutes and becomes almost a parody of every cheesy action flick you&apos;ve ever forgotten. &quot;Red Lights&quot; begins with one of the most suspenseful &apos;gotcha&apos; scenes in movie history--simply because it&apos;s the *opposite* of every thriller cliché you&apos;d never expect it. Immediately the film establishes itself as the true skeptic&apos;s thriller: a movie that&apos;ll scare the crap out of people who don&apos;t scare easily because they don&apos;t fall for ghosts and demons and spooky gags. This film sucks us into the intrigue NOT on the promise of supernatural gimmicks but on the opposite: a cryptic, real-world secret that explains all the fake supernatural stuff.\n\nFinally, I thought! A movie that can carry the suspense with pure, scientific reality. Almost like Mythbusters but with a dead person or two. Like a good political thriller (&quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot;, &quot;The Spy Who Came In from the Cold&quot;), the film is tense and riveting even though there aren&apos;t any shootouts or car chases or space robots. But, oh dear lord, all of that gets flushed in a supremely preposterous climax that left me wondering if the real director died during filming and was replaced by JJ Abrams.\n\nNobody is more disappointed than I am, because I really thought this would become one of my top 10 thrillers. Great acting, excellent mood cinematography and a wonderfully original story had the deck stacked in its favor. I&apos;m still in shock that it turned so sour, most probably for the sake of dazzling the less attentive audience members who demand gratuitous fight scenes and pyrotechnics (literal pyrotechnics lol) to give us a wow bang finish."

      "reviewBody": "This is a very dark sports movie. It&apos;s about fanaticism, the great weight of importance certain people place on sports. Sports fans often regard their teams as extensions of themselves. In &quot;Friday Night Lights,&quot; the entire town of Odessa, Texas collectively puts their town&apos;s reputation on the shoulders of a high school football team. It&apos;s basically the same exact plot as &quot;Varsity Blues,&quot; except a serious version of high school football in small town Texas.\n\nOne thing the movie does extremely well is taking hackneyed plots of the individual players (because it&apos;s all been done before) and putting them all in the background. So the plots play out not in a cheesy, inspirational, in-your-face way. Instead, they are just there with only as much attention as the viewer wants to put on them. The great aspects of sports are enough to keep us interested and makes the movie incredibly real.\n\nThe only character whose plot is really focused on is Boobie, the cocky running back who is injured and tries to defy his own injury. This is a plot in sports movies that has been focused on somewhat - the injured player. But never before has the pain been so real and so powerful.\n\nThis movie is heart-wrenching. Sports movies usually have so many moments of redemption and cheesy happiness that often feel false. This movie only has one such moment and it is incredibly powerful. Nothing about this movie is Hollywood. Billy Bob Thorton gives a great, understated performance as the coach, a man who is simply internal, who can do nothing but sit back and watch events unfold, knowing full well the impact that each game has on himself and his family. All the actors playing the football players do a good job, especially the guy who plays Boobie.\n\nDon&apos;t expect this movie to uplift you. But it will show you an interesting side of sports you may have never considered. And, in the end, it shows exactly what is great about sports, and it has nothing to do with winning or making a career out of the game. It&apos;s about giving all you have for a teammate."

(Although, I&apos;m a little hazy on just HOW it ends up that way.)  \n\nBoyle is definitely one of the great, stand-out directors of the 90s-and-beyond crowd, in the upper ranks with Tarantino, Fincher, Ritchie, and a few others.\n\n7/10 stars",

Colin is what is going to attract women to this film, and he does not disappoint.  He is the best thing about the movie.  Amanda Bynes is cute, and I enjoyed her too. The rest of the cast is quite good too...Anna Chancellor (Caroline Bingley, for those Pride and Prejudice fans...), and Eileen Atkins, particularly.  I found the storyline about the daughter longing for her father and the father who just discovered her quite sweet and moving.  Yes, the script was a bit sloppy and the humor often falls flat, but overall, Colin Firth&apos;s performance made it worth seeing for me.  This is definitely a chick flick, though :)",

      "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this even more than my rating suggests and I haven&apos;t scored it higher because it didn&apos;t make me want to see it again straightaway, which is basically my rationale for giving a film tops. Why not? Because, I think, I simply loved everything about this film and sat smiling and tingling not sure what was coming next but loving it all and I don&apos;t think all that would happen second time. Daft? Yes, maybe but certainly this is a must see film, perfectly constructed with full on comedic script and intelligent and sparkling dialogue. There is even a bit of action! Woody gives a nod here to Strangers on a Train but i think he he were honest there is even more of &apos;Dexter&apos;. Its that clever mix of logic, rationality, morality, sin and humour. Lots of little things amused me, I particularly liked the elements of &apos;chance&apos; and the astute and sharp critiques of various philosophers. i also enjoyed being surprised and never quite knowing where this was going - just loving the ride. This is most defiantly like &apos;one of those early funny ones, indeed we may have to start referring to &apos;those later funny ones&apos; if Woody Allen carries on at this rate. Excellent.",

      "reviewBody": "While at college I was given the assignment of producing a 30 minute talk on the &apos;Guarana Republic&apos; which is off course the subject matter of this movie. Hailing from the Protestant part of Europe I had never even heard about this aspect of Jesuit missionary work before, but as I researched the matter I became fascinated. So when I heard that a movie had been made about this topic I went to see it as soon as possible. Knowing how the film industry tended to treat historical events I was somewhat suspicious, but I was pleasantly surprised. This movie instantly became one of my all time favourites. I think the subject matter is handled sensitively and sensibly and the cinematography is stunning. What also impressed me was the clever way in which this story, which in reality spanned several generations, was compressed into a period of about ten years without becoming unbelievable. Even in a two hour movie there is a limit on what one can touch on, but I think that a good balance between dialogue, adventure, action, and character development, was struck. Even so if the movie would have lasted another hour I would still have been happy (perhaps even happier).",

She was stunning, beautiful, witty, charming, and just plain Bad ass. She worked it like no ones business. Her character was coming back for not only revenge but for peace in her own skin. Perfectly casted and perfectly executed. Liam Helmsworth....just plain delicious. Best of all was the ever FAB-U-LOUS Hugo Weaving back in the skirt again. He is just perfect in this film. With a taste of Priscilla Queen of the Desert it just doesn&apos;t get any better than Hugo. I see how this movie received standing ovations at film awards. It&apos;s worthy of it and more.

That means that it was on the torrentnet this morning, and as a result I got to watch it in Europe tonight. I&apos;m still reeling from the experience.\n\nI mean, we are talking Kevin Smith, king of the slacker movies, but at the same time the creator of one of the most intelligent and well-done movies about religion ever made, &quot;Dogma.&quot; I have seen every one of Kevin Smith&apos;s films, some of them multiple times. But as much as I like the guy, I&apos;ve never found myself asking, &quot;What would happen if this guy decided to step away from the slacker comedy and make a serious movie -- a horror movie about America, as he sees it?&quot; I never saw this movie coming.\n\n&quot;Red State&quot; is at its heart a horror movie. It starts by playing to horror movie conventions. Three teenaged guys, off for a night of fun in a neighboring Southern town, follow an Internet ad promising them a three-way with a willing older woman, and as a result wander into the WRONG Southern town. This town is the home of a Chrisschun religious cult, and they placed the ad. Try to imagine what the gay-hating and sex-hating Westboro Baptist Church would be like if they decided to take God&apos;s Law into their own hands and start killing the sinners themselves. Then try to imagine the situation escalating into a machine-gun-fire standoff with the ATF. What makes this such a good horror movie is that the horror could actually happen in the US. Everything about this movie is shocking *because it could actually happen*.\n\nKevin Smith is a closet politco. Who knew? This is a very, very, very powerful movie, about the hell that the United States of America has descended into post-9/11. It is SO not a comedy, although it contains very funny moments, and it is SO not for the faint-hearted, or for those who lean heavily to the right politically, or who believe that doing so is synonymous with leaning to the Right. God&apos;s Right.\n\nWith this film, Kevin Smith has risen to the top of my list of People I Most Want To Share Two Too Many Beers With Just So I Can Talk With Them."

      "reviewBody": "GRAVE ENCOUNTERS starts out as a parody of those &quot;ghost hunter&quot; reality shows, complete with an overly-dramatic host, a psychic, and an occult expert. The humor comes from the raw, unedited footage, where the stars mock and condemn the fakery of their own show.\n\nThe real fun begins when these same paranormal investigators take a film crew into an abandoned, supposedly haunted mental institution. After having themselves locked in for the night, our fearless adventurers settle in for what they expect to be a long, dull evening.\n\nWhat follows is a slowly-spiraling descent into terror, madness, and death.\n\nThe best part of ENCOUNTERS is its midsection, which is nearly perfect in its tense buildup. By comparison, the finale is abrupt and a bit of a buzzkill. Still, as &quot;found footage&quot; films go, it&apos;s a damned good one.\n\nAs with most such films, it&apos;s best viewed in total darkness..."

      "reviewBody": "The first half of the film was great. It was creepy, it was suspenseful, and it was almost scary (speaking as someone who considers most scary films to be dull and silly). The film did a good job of summarizing the first, and the 3D was generally well-done. So where did this film fail? Well first, the character relationships were extremely superficial, to the point where it felt like they were tacked-on or unrealistic. Some of the character motivations were also underdeveloped and made the characters come off as stupid or just hard to relate to, especially towards the end. The characters take a while to actually enter Silent Hill, and when they do the film quickly devolves from creepy moments to explaining the story, which is not particularly compelling. Obviously, the film makers had to work within the context of the original while trying to tie it into the third game, but so much of the film was devoted to characters explaining the plot that it made the film feel somewhat dull. Think of the old adage &quot;show, don&apos;t tell&quot;. The film was overly short, and it seemed as though this was the central problem. 20 more minutes to SHOW the plot, interspersed with a few more creepy scenes, and this film could have easily surpassed the original. Alas, the director chose to keep the film succinct, and the result is that it feels rushed and the last ten or fifteen minutes feel more like a cheesy action movie than a horror film. As I said, with twenty more minutes of footage, the film could have easily been one of the scariest movies of the last 10 years, and could have had believable characters and a more expertly revealed plot. Instead, we&apos;re left with a decent movie with a few good scares.",

      "reviewBody": "Short Circuit is an off-the-wall comedy about a series of robots made of the military. They sort of resemble Conky from the old Pee Wee&apos;s Play House series. One of the robots, &apos;Number Five&apos;, escapes and finds sanctuary in the home of Stephanie Speck (Allly Sheedy), a nice lady with a soft spot for runaways. \n\nSpeck becomes good friends with &apos;Number Five&apos; who begins to take on a lot of human characteristics, transcending the static life of a robot or the hostile life of a military weapon, which is what the robots were designed for. \n\nSpeck learns that Number Five&apos;s owners are looking for him, but she knows that the military would only destroy Number Five or terminate the emotional drive that he has developed. Number Five&apos;s designer, Newton Crosby (Guttenberg) and his silly assistant Ben Jabituya (Stevens), have yet to appreciate what Number Five has achieved, as a shell of wires and controls able to take on human qualities, but, soon, they too will join Speck in the quest to save &apos;Number Five.&apos; \n\nSome of it is kind of reminscint of other 80s sci-fi movies like &apos;Batteries Not Included&apos; and &apos;E.T.&apos; \n\nThere&apos;s two issues at work in this movie. The first, and obvious one being about the development of human emotion and would it be possible for anything to gain an understanding and appreciation for it? And the second being the ethics of military useage. Plus, it&apos;s your standard 80s love and friendship story. Because of the story and the sharp wit comedy and sarcasm, it&apos;s makes for good comedy. I haven&apos;t seen the sequel in a long time, but I do remember enjoying it almost as much as the first. I think that&apos;s because &apos;Number Five&apos; is such a funny, loveable robot.\n\nIf you like the theme of this movie, I recommend seeing the hilarious comedy, &apos;Making Mr. Right,&apos; which is about a robot designed for space exploration rather than military use. But, the robot begins to take on human emotions while the owner becomes increasingly more like a robot. (It&apos;s from Susan Siedleman, the director of &apos;Desperately Seeking Susan.&apos;)",

      "reviewBody": "I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love of the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent&apos;s Kiss, Reigne Margot).\n\nRedford&apos;s cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.\n\nWhat makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford&apos;s directorial hands. Given the material, Redford&apos;s elegant ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again.",

They are stuffed and not very threatening in their their traditional natural history diorama. The gift shop sells plush toys of these creatures. So let me get this straight. These things ate an alarming number of unfortunate people, but have become cuddly toys that kids might sleep with at night. I guess time heals all.\n\nAnyway, back to the movie. I loved the visual being of this film. The shots of Africa are remarkable. An incredible sense of threat is wonderfully created. The camera is used masterfully. The acting is quite good and the jump factor is quite high (although it is overdone a bit). Since this is based on but not really true to the actual events, the people can be forgiven for being so damned stupid. I described this to a friend as &quot;Jaws&quot; with lions. These particular felines seem to have the dangerous movie animal syndrome. The are sentient, they are vengeful, they have motivations beyond their basic animal needs, and they are nearly supernatural. Despite the danger realized by the principal characters, these lions are able to wreak their havoc anyway. While the scene is impressive, the fact that they get into a hospital while people are at red alert is hard to swallow. Either that, or they never really take seriously what these creatures have become. I enjoyed it mostly. Remember, lions know that people are stupid. If that&apos;s the case, how about a meal. If you don&apos;t take this too seriously, enjoy the ride. It will keep you on the edge of your seat.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t know if this is the best Western of the 1980&apos;s, it wouldn&apos;t be too hard I suppose as there wasn&apos;t really that many made in that decade, or now unfortunately. Its the best Western of that decade that I have seen, the only other good one I can recall is Silverado and Young Guns was pretty good though the sequel was even better. The 1990&apos;s was a much better decade for Western fans, Dances with Wolves, Unforgiven, Tombstone, Wyatt Earp, Young Guns 2, The Quick and the Dead and of course Bad Girls (Only joking!). Anyway Pale Rider seen Clint Eastwood return to the Western after quite a few years doing other types of movies and luckily Pale Rider is a great film. As has been mentioned in numerous other user comments it does borrow very heavily from the Classic Western Shane and Clint&apos;s own High Plains Drifter but it never tries to hide this fact and its a great film in its own right. Very moody and beautifully shot with great performances all round. Clint was on top of his game on this one and produced a top notch Western that ranks amongst one of his best below The Good the Bad and the Ugly, Unforgiven and The Outlaw Josey Whales. I would love to see Eastwood make another Western but find it highly unlikely as he couldn&apos;t possibly top his last one Unforgiven but at least Kevin Costner has got one coming out later this year. Look out for Richard Kiel in this one he played Jaws in a couple of Bond films and Sean Penns brother Chris, who was a lot thinner in those days! Highly recommended ***8/10***",

I mean, who wouldn&apos;t want to save an alligator that&apos;s biting people in half in an unspoiled lake 25 miles from anywhere in the middle of Maine? There are so many BAD time wasting movies out there, so much violent, or inane, or vulgar, or sadistic junk that this tongue-in-cheek tale with its dotty characters and clever ending just has to be viewed as one of those times to sit back and smile broadly without guilt. This is hard to pull off, and not to be minimized.",

      "reviewBody": "This will be short. I read the book when it first came out in 2000, and recently watched the film, and now am rereading the book. The book is dry and difficult, with three and half pages of involved people listed at the very beginning. Who can keep track of all this? It is replete with the taped conversations of the involved, all of the everything that went on. And, it is tedious, if correct, in the extreme. Well, what the film did, and bless it, was to simplify all of this stuff and make it intelligible to us ordinary folks. And, it made a really nasty story somewhat funny, because we know within the first half hour or so that there is something hinky about this Whitacre character. Oh boy, is there, but I won&apos;t write a spoiler here. There&apos;s no reason to. Even in the book, the FBI guys were wondering about Whitacre. Why did he turn traitor to his own company? What did he have to gain? The film is extremely well done, an amazingly good adaptation of a book which would probably have you snoozing after fifteen minutes. Matt Damon really shows his stuff in this one, even developing a modest middle age belly to complete the image of the nerdy scientist. \n\nWatch it, laugh at it, and remember: this is a true story about why most of the people in America are poor and how their losses are paying for the riches of companies which have decided that &quot;the customer is the enemy&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Surprisingly a good movie! I would be honest with you. From the trailers, I didn&apos;t expect much from Ferdinand Movie. But I was wonderstruck when I actually saw it. Watching it become a powerhouse of emotions as the movie progressed, I knew I had been dead wrong. That a movie should not be judged by its trailer, just as no book should be judged by its cover. Ferdinand movie didn&apos;t pack in as many jests as you find in animated movies nowadays, but it was a great entertainer nevertheless. It was successful in walking a tightrope of emotions. That&apos;s where its true strength lurked. When you focus on other parts critically you realize there were tons of issues strewn around the movie as well. But all of that can be overlooked once you become the bull the movie cashes in on, and try to empathize with that creature who doesn&apos;t share his dream based on his appearance, rather stands by his decision to see what others fail to. Story and Characters Not everyone is same. We have been wired differently. Whilst a father wishes to be something, his son might not share his dream. He might have a dream of his own. Everyone has a choice. That very fact forms the basis of Ferdinand movie. You can&apos;t decide or judge someone by their size or appearance. What you can&apos;t see, their brain, in fact, holds the key to their vision. Place that impactful storyline into animation and you have got an enjoyable hoot to savour. That&apos;s what Ferdinand does with its bull, the protagonist voiced by John Cena. He is an out of place animal who doesn&apos;t share other&apos;s dreams. Bullfighting in Ferdinand Movie Either you are a fighter, or you are meat. What you might call as someone&apos;s dream is a brilliant mockery of materialism. In the movie, the dream of fellow bulls is to fight the matador. Whilst the bulls in the flick fail to see the pointlessness of it, (like all the people who consider bullfighting a sport) Ferdinand in his blatant sense of indifference towards the game, digs up the real truth behind it. They are all ending up getting slaughtered! Just as we had seen in Sausage Party, the blind followers are all prepping up to die. Sure, you get to fight in a magnificent stage, but it&apos;s just another chop shop! Ferdinand movie uncovers the ugliness that surrounds the sport in a way that will leave you teary-eyed. Ferdinand is all about saving the meek, helping others. He is finding it hard to explain it to others why he is the way he is. Doesn&apos;t that chime in with life? I don&apos;t know, like your very own? How many times have you felt that way? As if you are in someone&apos;s else body, forced to live someone else&apos;s dream. Are you fighting for it? It&apos;s good to see someone is. Ferdinand is willing to leave no stones unturned to make the world understand he is not like the others. He is different. Violence his not his place even though he has been bedecked with a body that leaves the onlookers marveling. Look at your pecs! They are like two tiny bulls inside a bull. But the world, being the world, judges Ferdinand by the way he looks and brands him as destructive. A Glance at Life Ferdinand is given a shot at identifying his life the way he wishes to live it. He finds it in a place right next to Nina voiced by Lily Day. That&apos;s where he wishes to be - In a patch of land where a bull is chosen over a dog, Nina teaches Ferd the Nerd what love is all about. Is this love? I love love. It&apos;s that taste of life that helps the bull in registering home - not where you are born but where you are supposed to be. Deprived of the life he desires to lead, Ferdinand is picked up and dropped at Ground zero once again. He ends up in Casa del Toro, the place that he had escaped from, to be prepped up for bullfighting, something he is not cut out for. Unable to understand what the fuss is all about Ferd tries to escape a bull&apos;s fate, but ends up drawing himself closer to the inescapable sport. Lupe voiced by Kate McKinnon is one of those weird funny characters, who brings in most of the punches and stays close by. El Primero (Miguel Angel Silvestre) is in search of a bull to fight his final fight. Marking Ferdinand as a perfect contender he awaits him in the center of all applause. Even though the main villain brings that heightened sense of befitting contrast to Ferdinand&apos;s character, you realize it is a typical cliched build-up that you have often seen in countless movies in the past. El Primero might have reminded you of Anton Ego from Ratatouille if only he had better words to say. The screenplay of the flick, unfortunately, isn&apos;t impressive and hence framing him as a villain to remember is something you might want to reconsider. The Final Showdown What tears you apart is the final face-off that puts the bull against El Primero. While there&apos;s an imminent death written in the frames, the demeanor of the bull is enough to shatter you into pieces. The multitude is busy cheering the one with the sword, but they easily forget that the one fighting without is a true champion"

In same measure, the touch, especially in the meetings, of South Gothic. Another virtue - the gentle poeetry, the travel becoming, in some measure, scene by scene, yours. The exploration of family, in the perspective of young adults is another good point.\n\nThe sin - maybe, the paradoxal hurry, the characters remaining more sketches .\n\nBut , indeed, a beautiful film, deserving the atention each minute from its two hours."

I thought Hmmm...that looks good. I was immersed from the get go. 23 minutes into it I paused it and had to text all my friends and tell them to watch it. I just put a post on Facebook to please watch this incredible film. It was one the THE very BEST documentaries I have ever watched. I always knew the octopus was smart but this film reminded me how smart. The bond between the octopus and filmmaker were beyond amazing. See this film now. And tell all your friends. There are important messages to take away from this documentary and we need to share those messages. We are part of this earth. Not just visitors. By the way, this is my first ever review. I felt compelled to write one after seeing this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve heard many good things about James L. Brooks&apos;s &apos;Terms of Endearment&apos; and finally I decided to give it ago. Honestly speaking I was expecting a typical melodramatic tearjerker that&apos;s sole aim is to emotionally manipulate the viewer. I was wrong. &apos;Terms of Endearment&apos; is a slice of life that centres around a mother, her daughter and their respective lives. The film looks very authentic. The sets, makeup, costumes and art direction look genuine.\n\nThis is very much a character driven film. The dialogues are full of humour and wit but what&apos;s also striking is how deeply layered the words are. While the visuals are quite simplistic it&apos;s the characters that shine especially through the actors&apos; natural performances. Their excellent non-verbal gestures, spot on line delivery and restrained performances are superb.\n\nA sassy Shirley Maclaine and bubbly Debra Winger are spellbinding. Both actresses beautifully carry the film and they are brilliantly supported by fine actors like Danny DeVito, Jack Nicholson, John Lithgow and Jeff Daniels.\n\nWhat particularly appealed to me about &apos;Terms of Endearment&apos; is the depiction of the mother-daughter relationship and the dynamic of it. It definitely has its ups and downs and it does not involve the use of clichéd lines like &apos;I love you&apos; etc but at the same time the unconditional love between them is wonderfully conveyed."

      "reviewBody": "This was the last movie my wife and I saw in the actual theater-- back in March 2020 -- just days before covid-19 lockdown began. As of July we&apos;re wondering when we&apos;ll ever get to see another. In the meantime we&apos;ve acquired a big UHD TV and subscriptions to a bunch of streaming services. But there&apos;s still nothing to match watching on a big screen with a packed audience of engaged viewers.\n\nAnyway: long before there was &quot;Mean Girls&quot; and &quot;Clueless&quot;, there was Jane Austen&apos;s novel about a good-hearted but manipulative, un-self-aware young woman who has a great deal of learning to do about real people. This most recent version of &quot;Emma&quot; is very nice and certainly worth seeing in whatever format. I think it&apos;s neither better nor worse than the good 1996 version (the one with Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role) -- they both have fine production values and fine casts, just different emphases, shadings of the various characters, and the choices for cuts made to the story to make it fit into a normal 2-hour run time. Anya Taylor-Joy is not only a good, distinctively featured young actress but she also *looks* as young as Jane Austen&apos;s heroine is intended to be, about age 20. She has the (often baseless) self-confidence arising from a privileged, untroubled upbringing, but a journey of self-discovery awaits her, and that&apos;s what makes the story.\n\nOther standout characters include Mia Goth, who plays friend/protegee Harriet Smith as even more of a hapless stooge than usual; and the incomparable Bill Nighy as Emma&apos;s father Mr. Woodhouse. Is he really just a hypochondriac always fussing over cold drafts and fireplaces? It becomes clear that he knows and sees a good deal more than his loving but blithely unobservant daughter gives him credit for. And Nighy can steal scenes without saying a word, just by body posture and a raised eyebrow. He&apos;s a cinematic treasure. Johnny Flynn as Mr. Knightley is fine but a bit forgettable in the end.\n\nAnd the scenery. It&apos;s so lush and green and bright that you have to consciously shake yourself to realize that no, the English countryside is really NOT always warm and sunlit as it is here. But this is fiction, and it just helps us settle in and enjoy the comfortable ride through this classic tale. For the best screen version of Emma out there, though, I happily recommend the 2009 TV miniseries starring Romola Garai. She&apos;s perfect for the part, and its 4-hour length lets the full story expand and breathe the way it should.",

      "name": "What Good Will Hunting did for BPD, this movie does for PTSD...",
      "reviewBody": "An exquisitely poignant movie about a father and daughter trying to live off the grid in the woods out of town. \n\nBen Foster gives a truly amazing, understated performance as Will, the &quot;psychologically damaged&quot; father back from the un-named horrors of war, who has lost his wife and mother to his daughter, Tom. Thomasin McKenzie as Tom, brings a gentle, caring teenager, supporting her father, who is trying to retreat from the world into the woods.\n\nThe film is beautifully shot, and the pair are very believable as they hide out from the authorities who want her &quot;in school&quot; and him in some gainful employment, separating and further traumatising both of them while doing the &quot;right thing&quot;. But Will, with his unseen, unacknowledged PTSD, is unable to settle into &quot;normal&quot; suburban life, and needs to run constantly from his demons from the past.\n\nUltimately there is a poignant decision to be made, as daughter and father can no longer walk the same pathways. But this movie has such depth, and such compassion for its characters, and their struggles, that even though you know that a climax must come, it still takes you by surprise. Wonderful acting from the supporting cast, including a cameo by Isaiah Stone, adding complexity to Tom&apos;s choices... But modern life cannot accommodate outliers, those who won&apos;t conform.\n\nThis movie broke my heart, little by little, but has become my favourite indie movie for 2018. If you open your heart and mind, you will find it memorable. Oh, and no sex, drugs or rock and roll, nor animals were harmed - if you like your drama real and personal, and with no car chases or shoot &apos;em ups, this one is a winner!",

However, it faces criticism for deviating from Tom Clancy's book, failing to capture its essence.

      "reviewBody": "Downton Abbey (2019) was directed by Michael Engler. We loved Downton Abbey as a TV show. The film is like two more episodes of the show. A few new characters, but mostly everyone that we knew before is back.\n\nMichelle Dockery as Lady Mary is still beautiful, Maggie Smith is still fabulous, and Jim Carter as Mr. Carson is still the world&apos;s most perfect butler.\n\nThe film assumes that you know the characters, so there&apos;s not much backstory. It&apos;s fine if you do, indeed, know who everyone is both upstairs and downstairs. Only a few new characters are introduced, so you can sort them out pretty quickly.\n\nWe saw the movie at Rochester&apos;s excellent Little Theatre. It won&apos;t work quite as well on the small screen. However, don&apos;t forget that we all originally watched the show on the small screen. Still, director Engler has some great outdoor shots, which make the production values appear even more lush.\n\nDownton Abbey has a very high IMDb rating of 7.9. I gave it a 7.0, because I thought that director Engler could have had more creative, better plots. It&apos;s still a must-see if you&apos;re a Downton Abbey fan. If you&apos;re not familiar with the show, learn some of the basic plot lines before you watch the film.",

Its superb!!, images are incredibly neat and well done. In this department I would give the movie an 11 out of ten.\n\nfirst chapter is absolutely flawless, its amazing, one of the best pieces of animation I&apos;ve ever seen, maybe even the best. You are captivated by the characters amazingly fast, its fantastic. another 11 out of ten.\n\nSecond chapter is also very good but.. the first chapter is so perfect that you don&apos;t think much of the second one.\n\nlast chapter is good. actually it is PERFECT, it allows the movie to make its point. in other words, it ends the way it has to. I did not give this chapter a 10 ONLY because it made me really sad ( I don&apos;t think I&apos;m spoiling anything by saying this). I thought it was going to end in a completely different way.\n\nAnyway, I recommend this movie a lot, just the animation and the first chapter makes it worth it. If you like the ending you could probably rank it as a 9.5 or ten.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a marvelous film.  Warren Beatty managed to film it just like a comic book MIGHT be brought to film with humourously grotesque and bizarre characters, beautiful colours, and a plot that really only could have come from a comic book.  The buildings, set design, make-up, and props are like nothing I have ever seen in film before.  Now, never having read the original strip leaves me out as far as making probably very insightful comparisons with this film and the original source.  That being said, I think that Beatty, although drastically changing some of the villains in the film to fit smaller roles, tried to keep the spirit of the film inside the comic strip.  Does that make sense?  Probably not.  Anyway, Dick Tracy offers a lot.  It is a visual feast with a decent story and some prime time stars doing some things you may not expect from them.  Beatty is very good as the lawmen, but much of the supporting cast steals many scenes from him. Al Pacino as Big Boy Caprice is sensational as an over-the-top thug out to get every criminal under his control, while he intermittenly quotes folks like Nietchze, Jefferson, and other historical figures.  Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles is wonderful - if you can finally figure out that it is him(notice in the scene where a stenographer is taking down what he says((That is Oscar winner Kathy Bates!))).  James Caan has a brief yet good scene with Pacino Godfather style and Beatty gives Michael J. Pollard and Estelle Parsons cameos as well(both co-starring with him in Bonnie and Clyde).  Then there is Madonna.  She tries her best to live up to her name of Breathless and does a VERY credible job at it.  And then of course there is the music of Stephen Sondheim, an Oscar winner for this film.  It is very good and in some ways more memorable than much of what goes on in the film.  Perhaps a song here or there might have been cut, but for the most part the music greatly added to the overall effects created in the film.  Is Dick Tracy great?  No, but it is a whole lot better than it is generally given credit for.  In some ways its innovation must be reviewed again.  I think that for its type of film it is one of the best."

      "reviewBody": "The soul of Satanic serial killer Charles Lee Ray is, by misfortune, incarcerated in the body of a seemingly innocuous doll. Ray&apos;s long time girlfriend, Tiffany (the seductive Jennifer Tilly) has found a book titled &quot;Voodoo for Dummies.&quot; Now, she has called on the spirits of Hell to revive this left-for-dead doll...and to make him alive and well again!\n\nWhen everything is botched in a misconstrued matter...Tiffany imminently finds herself in the body of another plastic doll as well. The two notorious murderers, known for their multiple crimes, fall in love again...and the world needs a prayer...\n\nYes, Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) the killer doll is back...and he&apos;s out for anyone&apos;s blood! Chucky&apos;s new bride Tiffany has also found herself enjoying all the twisted, creative murders Chucky has made. Chucky and Tiffany have one goal: to retrieve the &quot;Heart of Omzilla,&quot; an amulet that will thus allow both of them to return to their former human selves...\n\nYou better watch out! Chucky is no more mister nice guy!\n\nBRIDE OF CHUCKY is a sinister guilty pleasure! The Chucky franchise earns its much desperately needed (and deserved) revision. Thanks to Ronny Yu&apos;s (who has directed so many Hong Kong martial arts films) direction and the wizardry of special FX make-up artist Kevin Yagher, Chucky is livelier...and deadlier than ever. Yagher does a great job giving Chucky such human traits and attributes. Chucky is one demonic and realistic character whom I would NOT like to run into in a dark alley! Chucky himself looks especially deformed, with the appropriate stitches on his face and everything. For a pint size villain, he packs one mean attitude! Also, the facial expressions of the killer puppets Chucky and Tiffany are so bizarre, yet wonderfully genuine. One fact for sure, I was impressed by all the elaborate special effects... Hey, you must also adore the cogent and delightfully deviant love-hate relationship between Chucky and Tiffany.\n\nJohn Ritter (!) is excellent (though unusually cast against type) as an uncompromising Security Chief Officer. Ritter should also earn an award for the best (and most unpredictable) demise. He certainly knows how to be dying in style! Brad Dourif really knows this Chucky character inside out. He delivers the wisecracks with impeccable timing before and after each killing. Alexis Arquette (THE WEDDING SINGER) is in top form as a &quot;Goth&quot; who encounters the devil doll. Jennifer Tilly is one fantastic, nefarious temptress.\n\nThere&apos;s plenty of bloodletting in this pleasantly entertaining (and sleazy) thriller. Lots of gory murders abound to keep bloodhounds ingratiated. This grotesquely violent and sanguinary film will easily scare away the squeamish. In addition, there are lots of cool (and sometimes subtle) references alluding to other horror flicks. I also learned from this movie that a person should not take love for granted.\n\nBRIDE OF CHUCKY is an imaginative journey into everlasting terror. You will laugh and churn as you witness the brutal slayings as the consequences of this couple&apos;s rampage. If you appreciate dark, macabre humor, then this movie is perfect for you! By far the best film in this series. This movie is even better than the original CHILD&apos;S PLAY ...\n\nRATING: **1/2 out of ****."

The characters build well, the writing is very solid, and the story is quite original.\n\nAll in all &apos;Basic&apos; is a good thriller that is a little complex and confusing for the casual movie fan.\n\nDefinitely worth watching, but not a classic \n\n7/10",

She is on the road to getting her veil when we discover she was also brought up in one of those homes and was plagued by visions which she was thought that they were her imagination. When a girl starts having similar experiences she grows close to her trying to uncover the route of them. As people are losing faith in God around the world the church pose a plot to gain back their faith, going to extreme lengths, sinister lengths.\n\nThe movie is solid, it focuses on telling a story in the horror genre with about 3 jumpscares and a major lean on visual horror scenes.\n\nThe acting is good, there also seems to be a good sense of dread in the entire movie as the characters are on edge the whole time. The settings are good and the music is good. The story is a little predictable as I caught on quite quick the &quot;twist&quot;\n\nOverall an enjoyable time and I hope more of these come out as I like them not filled with Jumpscares as that gets so boring, 7.5/10.",

It&apos;s also visually stunning and perfectly acted: every single one of these people seem to be just giving their own opinions as if you were overhearing/having a meaningful conversation with them. \n\nWe can chalk this up to the genius of Linklater who over the years has shown not only the pretentiously humorous coffee house crowd cliches but also the searching, often deeply insightful side of our generation that the media overlooked when we were dubbed slackers. In films he has written: &quot;Slacker&quot; and &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; and in his films of stage plays Bogosian&apos;s brilliant, Chekhovian &quot;SubUrbia&quot; and the faintly melodramatic &quot;Tape&quot;, Linklater has always been fascinated with the question of what we should doing with our lives. Our responsibility is to contribute something lasting and meaningful to our society. But what exactly is that? Where and when should I do it? Who with? How do I know if I&apos;ve really found it? Why is it so important again, anyway?\n\n I saw this movie for the first time late last night and 5 minutes before it started I had fallen asleep and was hoping I&apos;d be able to make it all the way through the film. From the first frame I was riveted and completely awake and remained so even after it was over; contemplating all the myriad viewpoints the film had thrown at me.\n\nThis movie is so exciting and bursting with ideas that I&apos;m going to buy the DVD as soon as I possibly can and watch it over and over trying to absorb it all.\n\nSee this film. It will remind you of how thrilling it is to be an active thinking, feeling member of the human race.",

      "reviewBody": "What do you want from a Jet Li movie? By the time of Kiss Of The Dragon being released, many of his fans had been vociferous about how his film&apos;s were losing realism in the fight scenes. Here, teaming up with Luc Besson &amp; Robert Mark Kamen in the writing room, Li himself set about readdressing the balance for American produced martial artistry. The result is of course a preposterous plot that should duly have been expected, but without doubt for action fans this is a real high kicker that delivers thrill after thrill as Li beats up Paris.\n\nThe plot simply sees Li as Chinese intelligence agent Liu Siu-jian who is sent to Paris to aid in the apprehension of a Chinese drug lord. Things go belly up when corrupt cops led by Insp. Richard {Tchéky Karyo} wipe out the target and frame Liu Siu-jian for the murder. But he ain&apos;t going to take it on the chin. So with the help of prostitute witness Jessica Kamen (Bridget Fonda), he sets about clearing his name whilst perhaps helping Jessica get her life back on track too. Cue the odd couple forming a tender relationship as they shift from one death defying encounter to another.\n\nThe action on offer here is excellently put together, there&apos;s minimal CGI and even less wire work involved. This is stunts and martial artistry produced by a master craftsman. From a unique use of a snooker ball to an exhilarating smack down with a class of martial arts students, and on to a tag team scrap with the blonde twins, this has enough biff and bam to fill the Louvre itself. Li is on fire, not only one of the toughest guys on the planet, but also one of the coolest. While Fonda is hugely touching in a stereotypical role and Karyo continues to be one of the best psycho actors in the new millennium.\n\nFlaws and plot holes here? Of course. Does it matter in a buttock kicking action movie? Course not. 7.5/10",

Little does anybody know, G-Girl is really Jenny Johnson.\n\nWhen Matt introduces Jenny to his long-time work friend Hannah(Ana Faris), Jenny begins to act jealous and controlling, which leads to him dumping her. But that upsets her greatly, so she decides to get her revenge, using her powers to make his life a living hell.\n\nMy the final sequence, &apos;Girlfriend&apos; gets out of control. But it&apos;s this refreshing, weird and funny premise that this summer needs. It&apos;s the perfect comedy to beat the summer heat.\n\nFor a film that is so silly, it&apos;s surprisingly well-executed. Everything gels, and director Ivan Reitman catches us off-guard with moments of absurd hilarity.\n\nPerformances are likable all around, with Uma Thurman portraying G-Girl with believable ease. Luke Wilson is well-cast as the guy in over his head. Writing is solid, and direction keeps things breezy.\n\n&apos;My Super Ex Girlfriend&apos; is a thoroughly engaging, screwball comedy that&apos;s driven by a silly premise that works."

Although the ending is not as thrilling as the whole movie, but still it is exceptional and unforeseen, its still great.\n\nAnd I must say, i was disappointed by Bollywood..(this time they have done it original, no copycat/remake/based upon/Hollywood&apos;s copy).. pure original mind blowing suspense.",

In terms of tennis playing, there were some damn cool tennis sequences. some of the best i would say. but that doesn&apos;t really make up for the somewhat empty story-line. all in all, this film ain&apos;t too bad. the people that watch it oughta be tennis fans or Kirsten fans (!). other than that, everyone else is just going to be watching another shallow romance flick."

      "reviewBody": "The Young Victoria luckily has a story, and even better than that, it has good actors. That&apos;s where a film like The Other Boleyn Girl fails. The acting just didn&apos;t match the characters. Emily Blunt, who has quickly risen up the ranks into Hollywood A-list status, gives one of her better performances, worthy of her Golden Globe nomination, as the famed English monarch Queen Victoria.\n\nThe film follows Victoria in the year leading up to her coronation and into the first few years of her reign, including her relationship of Prince Albert (Rupert Friend). Victoria was a very protected and sheltered princess who was under constant surveillance by her mother and close friend and adviser. Victoria was next in line to take the crown once the King had passed, on so naturally a lot of attention as to when she would ascend to the thrown and how was being discussed. One thing is clear; Victoria does not want to be treated like a child.\n\nHer budding romance with Prince Albert starts before she is made Queen. The Prince is selected to try and win her affection as a political ally, but one thing leads to another and the two become smitten with each other. Albert is aware that the two of them are very young and must look out for one another, especially in the realm of politics. So called &quot;friends&quot; can become powerful influences on the crown, especially in the case of Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), who imposes his political party&apos;s agenda upon the queen in a back door sort of way, surrounding her with his own people.\n\nVictoria learns quickly, and so do we, that the game of politics is a dicey one. It&apos;s hard to see which side people are really on, and by the time you do it might be too late.\n\nI was pleased with the pace and direction of this movie. It could have been too much about the fashion or too much about the politics, but it balanced the two out pretty well. Blunt and Friend are fine opposite each other, playfully going back and forth with their Victorian era flirtations. There is a definite bond their that shows up well on screen.\n\nThe rest of the cast does an excellent job. Bettany, Miranda Richardson as Victoria&apos;s mother the Duchess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy, the Duchess&apos; adviser, and a nice cameo by Jim Broadbent as an ailing King William. Bettany in particular plays his role quite well, never really telling us whether he is helping the Queen out or trying to do good for himself alone.\n\nThe costumes are quite authentic and well made. They don&apos;t always distract the viewer&apos;s eye but at times they are a bit showy. I guess those were the times. The sets are incredibly detailed. I particularly liked the attention paid to the little knick-knacks and pieces of furniture in the bedrooms and studies. It felt like people were living there.\n\nIt wasn&apos;t a perfect film and it did have it&apos;s dull moments. I thought it ended nicely and didn&apos;t wander off to take us places where we didn&apos;t need to go.",

      "reviewBody": "Fairy tales are wide spread, with witches and curses they have, they are all too familiar with their poor damsel in need of rescue by the Charming Prince. The same can be said for poor Penelope, played by the essence of beauty and intelligence that is Christina Ricci. Famed for her roles as Wednesday Addams in the Addams Family movies, then &quot;Kat&quot; Harvey in Casper and during an Ice Strom she was Wendy Hood, hey, she&apos;s even dated a lesbian Monster and been chained up in Black Snake Moan. This, too, is the second in a row movie that consists of her taking a curse, the previous being John Carpenter&apos;s light horror werewolf flick Cursed (2005). You name it she has done it, and with perfection. Now all grown up she is playing the titular role of her 2006 movie Penelope.\n\nFilmed in London, and with a high level of English actors too, and cast as an American fairy tale, this is the unlucky story of a witches curse on the first-born daughter of the Blue Blood (aristocrat) family, the Wilhern&apos;s. The only way to break said curse is to find her Charming Prince who shall love her for all her worth, pig nose and all. Yep, her curse is to be born with the nose and ears of a pig, poor girl. Kept away from others for all her childhood and youth by her grieving parents, played with relish by Richard E. Grant and the lovely Catherine O&apos;Hara adding a touch of very hyper stressed and neurotic motherly love. Who could ask for more? Well, more is what we get here, more fun, more sad reflection and more diversity from the standard tale of woe. With its witty players from said Grant and O&apos;Hara, we also get the very talented James McAvoy and the nemesis that is Lemon, the evil News Reporter, Peter Dinklage, hot on her tail for revenge. Having done &quot;Lassie&quot; (2005), &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot; (2007) and in the pipeline &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot;. Excellent actor.\n\nFunny in parts, and poignant in others, not an epic but not a waste of time either. A story of self believe and how one can learn to love oneself and then be loved in return, in any way, shape or form. Simple I know, but in this case, it works, with all the surrounding American accents sometimes rubbing the wrong way, we can easily dismiss the poor adaptations.\n\nThis ugly duckling fable will warm to your hearts and tingle you with delight, with a charming narrative and distinctive feel good factor, and if Disney had gotten their hands on the project, it just might have come across as over sappy, over benevolent and over too soon. And it&apos;s a good job they didn&apos;t, wasn&apos;t it?",

Gerard Butler on the other hand might be one good thing in the whole film. The multiverse-travel scene is a total disaster. The character development of the lead people, and also Doniger, is left behind which took away much taste from the story.\n\nReading the book is more recommended.",

Voice characterizations led by Nick Nolte, Sylvester Stallone, and Cher give the animals personality but really little else. James is definitely a likable comedic force, but he deserves better material. The leading ladies struggle to keep up his mild momentum and really the animals are not even needed as their appearances sometimes distract from what is going on as the plot limps along into development. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

Its a very British film with all the gentle humour irony and brilliant acting you would expect. Kristin Scott Thomas steals it for me as the pushy Press Secretary to the Prime Minister and really deserves recognition as supporting actress. The scene where she is getting her kids off to school and her comments to her son are hilarious in street talk. Emily Blunt is delicious and Ewan McGregor plays his most understated but elegant role yet. Loved the scene with his wife Mary in the bedroom with him wearing flannel blue striped pyjamas Great casting, great acting, great script,great photography. What&apos;s not to like,oh the salmon were fantastic , don&apos;t actually know if any were hurt in the filming, but bet if they were they tasted great! Lovely movie",

      "reviewBody": "Okay, so &apos;Baseketball&apos; hasn&apos;t really got anything to do with the adult cult animated TV show, but it stars both its writers/creators and is basically the same sense of humour, i.e. adult. In short if you like South Park, you should like &apos;Baseketball.&apos; It&apos;s about two losers (Trey and Matt – the men behind South Park) who invent a new game which is basically a cross between basketball and baseball in their driveway.\n\nBefore long it becomes a national pastime. As with South Park, a lot of the humour is vulgar, crude, disgusting and totally &apos;adult&apos; in nature. You could be forgiven for thinking that Baseketball is nothing more than a low-brow gross-out comedy (and you may have a point!), but, also like South Park, it has its moments of satire and social commentary that raise it to more than just Trey and Matt&apos;s version of &apos;American Pie.&apos; \n\nThe jokes come thick and fast and, if you&apos;ve seen Trey and Matt in action, you&apos;ll realise that they&apos;re basically playing themselves. Yes, there is some character development (believe it or not!), but the film is geared towards laughs over story and plot. And, because of this, it totally succeeds. As soon as you sit down to watch it, you&apos;ll be able to predict where exactly it&apos;s going, but don&apos;t let that put you off. So I&apos;ll end where I basically began by saying that if you like South Park (and I do!), you&apos;ll enjoy this.",

Loved Christian Bale, Benedict Cumberbatch and Cate Blanchett as Bagheera, Shere Khan and Kaa respectively. Rohan as Mowgli was very convincing. Just that i think I missed how the hunter came in the 1st place.\n\nI&apos;ll watch it again absolutely.",

      "reviewBody": "Menace II Society is much more than your typical hood movie. It tells the story of young Caine Lawson, a teen growing up in Watts, California. \n\nThe opening briefly shows Caine getting caught up in a grocery store shooting with his friend. This was a chilling way to open the movie, as it shows how easy it is for someone in the ghetto to get caught up in the moment and kill someone. During the opening credits, we see footage of the Watts riots that took place during the 60&apos;s. Caine narrates the story of his life, explaining how after the riots, drugs came into effect, and affected his home life as a child. After loosing his parents on at the hands of drugs, he was sent to live with his Grandparents. His Grandparents love him, but they struggled to raise him and tried their hardest to keep him out of trouble. \n\nNot too long into the movie, after we learn about Caine&apos;s early life, we see him graduate from High School. He hopes to leave the life of violence that surrounds him in his neighborhood. After falling victim to a violent car jacking, he is brought into violence and crime himself. As the story progresses, and things spiral downward for Caine, he ends up in a hell of a jam and tries to make a way out of it all. \n\nThis is an incredible movie. It perfectly balances the ugly crime life and murder of tough inner city neighborhoods, Caine&apos;s own personal troubles, police brutality, and drugs. \n\nThis is a powerful movie with a great story. It has a good message, but in some ways, I thought the film Boyz N the Hood showed the message in a better way. Menace II Society is more focused on the crime involved in inner cities, where as Boyz N the Hood focuses more on the family life of the characters. \n\nThis is an excellent film that you should see if you ever get the chance. It has a good message, and it has some very moving moments in it. \n\nIf you enjoyed this, I also recommend Boyz N the Hood, and you&apos;ll probably enjoy the Wayans brothers&apos; spoof, Don&apos;t be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.",

      "reviewBody": "Freddy Krueger began as a very scary character who scared the hell out of everyone. As the movies went on, Freddy lost his edge and looked liked a bad stand up comic with horrible one liners.\n\nFreddy seemed dead with the sixth film of the series, but Wes Craven brought him back from his rut and made him someone to fear again. This of course helps prove my theory that a good Nightmare on Elm Street movie cannot be made without Craven.\n\nTwo things make this film so good. One, the story is original. The Nightmare movies just kept repeating themselves, with Freddy coming back and going after the people who stopped him before. This rime around, we see Freddy trying to break into the real world, outside the movies. Very original. Two, the movie is not filled with constant gore. This shows how good the movie because any movie filled with gore obviously has a pathetic story and is not worth watching. This movie is and is one of Freddy&apos;s best yet."

The majority of Indians&apos; lives are destined to be less than human. Slaves.\n\nThis little gem of a movie covers the tragedy through the eyes of a country &quot;mouse&quot;.

      "reviewBody": "Either you make a sequel or a remake it is inevitable to compare it with the original. All too often a remake has nothing to do with the original except maybe the names of the characters involved.\n\nPretty much this is the case of Point Break (2015).\n\nThe &quot;original&quot; Point Break was a multilayer action movie. The romantic element was stronger, its purpose more clear, the fine line a deep undercover agent could cross and lose himself more evident and, because that matters the most in this cases, more fun.\n\nIn the &quot;contemporary&quot; version you are going to see some wild landscapes, including Angel Falls in Venezuela, Caineville in Utah and the Swiss Alps missing in the original. Yet the greenish over-sharped image, chosen by Ericson Core who serves both as the director and as cinematographer, dilutes their majestic natural appearance and makes them look artificial.\n\nThe movie also talks, in the beginning, about nirvana and spiritual enlightenment but in the end fails to emit such feelings towards the viewers.\n\nSo is it bad? Well no I wouldn&apos;t say that. it us a totally different beast. More raw, even more dramatic but with far less wit and charisma.\n\nThe cast isn&apos;t stellar. I wouldn&apos;t compare Ray Winstone with the ...shadow of the tongue-in-chic Pappas (Gary Busey) of the first installment. Neither Teresa Palmer is the smart-mouthed Lori Petty. All the characters are pretty much wooden and one dimensional.\n\nOverall: I would say to check it out for the impressive stunts and landscapes, but the sharp and green cinematography ruined that for me. No real substance in the fun department or the performances either."

He deserved his Oscar for Wall Street, commanded every second of screen time he had in Falling Down, and has given some of the most underrated comic performances in history in Romancing the Stone and War of the Roses. But I&apos;d have to give his performance in Wonder Boys as his best. His turn as stoner college professor Grady Tripp is the model for the laid back, totally likeable and loveable protaginist. He&apos;s the kind of professor I dream of having in real life.\n\nAfter watching this movie, I seriously wanted to go and write a book.

      "reviewBody": "I am an avid fan of the original movie. While the concept of vigilantism has been around for decades in film, it was never communicated in such a way. The original movie was both entertaining, and made certain statements about society. After all, isn&apos;t the first purpose of film to entertain, and the second to create a message? If the first movie focused on the message, the second seemed to focus more on the entertainment. I&apos;m OK with that. I already know what the McManus boys are all about. Still, it was refreshing to see Il Duce&apos;s beginning as a killer, even catching a glimpse of the first version of the gun vest.\n\nI was very skeptical of Clifton Collins Jr., thinking that he would simply be a stand-in for Rocco. He wasn&apos;t. He had his own personality, although I would have liked to have seen him involved in what the boys were doing on a more personal level. It was like he was waiting for them to come along just so he would have an excuse to kill mobsters.\n\nThe humor, slow-motion gunfights, and light-hearted moments were back. During the first half, I sometimes felt the humor needed to be left behind and the serious tone needed to come into play, but the second half delivered that aspect very well, so it balances out in the end.\n\nJulie Benz. Hmmmm. Attractive, intelligent, fun. But the southern accent is so thick I had a hard time focusing on anything else.\n\nI would like to make a special note of how ridiculous it is for someone to dual-wield Desert Eagles, even if they have compensators attached.\n\nStill, none of my complaints stopped me from enjoying the movie. I watched it for what it is. An over the top-low(er) budget film that was written to please fans of the original. I took it for what it is, and I think I&apos;m better off for it.\n\nMany people criticize Troy and the films themselves, some going so far as to say fans should go kill themselves. The internet, where everyone thinks their opinion is fact, and everyone is a hardass. If you don&apos;t like the movies, fine, but please, don&apos;t insult the intelligence of the fans. Liking something that you don&apos;t doesn&apos;t make us any less intelligent than you. If you want to pick on someone, pick on the Twilight fans that think those movies are a real representation of love and vampire mythology.\n\nI hear Troy can be a bit of a douche. Maybe that&apos;s true, maybe it isn&apos;t. What isn&apos;t true, is that the movies do not rip off of Tarantino. I like Tarantino&apos;s work, but he was not the first person to do the flashback narrative, dual wielding of pistols, slow motion gunfights, etc. etc. That&apos;s like saying Halo was the first good shooter. All movies borrow elements from one another. They&apos;re called themes and archetypes.\n\nAll in all, an enjoyable film that gives the fans a taste of what they&apos;ve been missing for ten years. The editing is a little spotty at times, and not everything hits the right beat, but simply to see the boys in action again was enough to make me smile and laugh out loud, and once again, isn&apos;t that what movies are supposed to do? Its supposed to entertain us.",

The characters are underdeveloped and the script underwritten, but it is somewhat gripping and you are ready to invest in these vain monsters.\n\nThe first &quot;scare&quot; comes at the halfway mark, and this is where the movie really goes downhill. Although the art in question is admittedly gorgeous and the premise seems intriguing, it just doesn&apos;t work. It&apos;s tedious and boring, neither working as a modern trashy jump scare flick or a more thought provoking atmosphere piece, and you are left running down the clock on this clunker.\n\nThe music is invasive, often intruding and standing out too much. The cuts are strange, cutting too fast and consequently using way too many cuts. The dialogue is pretty unnatural &amp; feels overly theatrical.\n\nMissed as anything but a pointed take down of the art world, and even then it&apos;s not great. Some memorable &quot;horror&quot; visuals, art pieces &amp; turns (such as John Malkovich expectedly playing John Malkovich) are certainly present, but getting there might be a doozy.\n\n4.5",

      "name": "Texas Chainsaw Massacre returns in a follow-up that aims for legacy sequels like Halloween &apos;18, but instead continues TCM&apos;s legacy of mediocre follow-ons.",
      "reviewBody": "A group of four friends Melody (Sarah Yarkin), Melody&apos;s sister Lila (Elsie Fisher), Dante (Jacob Latimore), and Dante&apos;s girlfriend Ruth (Nell Hudson) travel to the deserted city of Harlow, Texas with Melody seeking a fresh start for her sister Lila after her surviving a school shooting and also seeking to re-invent the town as a resort destination after having acquired it for cheap from the bank. The town has two residents a woman (Alice Krige) and her son (Mark Burnham) at the local orphanage who refuse to vacate claiming to be the rightful owners of the property. Calling the sheriff to remove the alleged squatters the woman begins to exhibit deteriorating health and the sheriff, Ruth, and the woman&apos;s son head off to the nearest hospital to find help. When the woman dies, her son goes into a vengeful rage killing the sheriff, Ruth, and his deputy and he takes the skin from his mother&apos;s face revealing him to be the killer from the unsolved Texas Chainsaw Massacre 50 years ago and who now seeks vengeance on Melody and her friends blaming them for his mother&apos;s death. Sally Hardesty (Olwen Fouere) receives word of Leatherface&apos;s re-emergence and heads to Harlow to end him once and for all.\n\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre marks the latest attempt to revive the Texas Chainsaw IP following the lapse in Millennium Media&apos;s rights after the troubled development and release of 2017&apos;s Leatherface prevented any further sequels produced by Millennium. Legendary Pictures purchased the IP in 2018 with Fede Alverez of the Evil Dead remake and Don&apos;t Breathe signing on as a producer. The movie was a troubled production with original directors, Andy and Ryan Tohill being fired following disagreements with the producers leading to replacement David Blue Garcia. Further bad press was generated when rumors circulated regarding poor test screening s which Alverez flat out denied and then the reveal that the film would be skipping a theatrical release and sold to Netflix. Netflix did surprising little to promote the film with no trailer released until January 31 for the film and the trailing receiving a rather mixed response, particularly for the &quot;Bus scene&quot; prominently featured in the trailer that is clearly intended as the film&apos;s big money moments with a rather stupid joke about the social media age. After viewing the film, Texas Chainsaw Massacre &apos;22 isn&apos;t a trainwreck, but I almost wish it was because as bad as Texas Chainsaw 3D and Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation were, they were at least fascinatingly bad. TCM &apos;22 falls in line with entries like Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, the Platinum Dunes remake, or Leatherface (2017) in that their competent, but they&apos;re just &quot;there&quot; and nothing more.\n\nIn terms of the filmmaking it looks and feels like a Texas Chainsaw movie and even falls in line with the cinematography of the original 1974 film. The work on the older Leatherface for his mask and costume looks nicely filthy, wet, and disgusting, and the dilapidated town of Harlow in theory is a decent setting for this type of movie. I also thought Elsie Fisher was good as Lila and thought she was the most resonant character who fit well in the role.\n\nIn terms of the rest of the movie, it&apos;s pretty underwhelming. The other three characters in the group aside from Lila are just bland and forgettable and the bus full of prospective investors are basically just walking blood bags waiting for Leatherface to cut through them. Even the return of an older Sally Hardesty played by Olwen Fouere is underwhelming because despite Fourere&apos;s best efforts and doing her best to succeed Marilyn Burns the character is basically a less fun version of Dennis Hopper&apos;s Lefty Enright from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and she makes some pretty stupid decisions in the movie (like having Leatherface at gunpoint and NOT pulling the trigger because she&apos;s shocked he doesn&apos;t remember her) and you probably could&apos;ve easily written that character out with little effort and merged her role with the established character of Richter who&apos;s given much more prominence. It&apos;s clear the take on the character is inspired by Blumhouse&apos;s Halloween series, but it lacks the polish of them (the first anyway). And once again, the movie makes the mistake of trying to play Leatherface as &quot;sympathetic&quot;. Granted the movie never goes as far as Texas Chainsaw 3D did when he became an anti-hero victim of mob justice, but the movie frames Leatherface&apos;s rampage motivated by the death of his mother with a certain level of &quot;righteousness&quot; and that&apos;s not how you create a monster you should be scared of. The movie has some pretty on the nose satire about gentrification (such as &quot;the Bus scene&quot;) and it&apos;s pretty toothless when you&apos;re trying to play both sides as equally valid when one side has a man in hiding who ate people and turned their remains into furniture and wind chimes. I will say that I&apos;m glad they didn&apos;t do yet another rehash of the Dinner Table scene, with the exception of Texas Chainsaw 3D that Dinner Table scene has been referenced in every single TCM film, so at least the filmmakers had the knowledge that another take would&apos;ve been beating a dead horse.\n\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 is just more of the same. The best Texas Chainsaw follow-up remains Tobe Hooper&apos;s over the top comedy sequel Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and I think that speaks to how little meat there is to this franchise that the only way Hooper thought it could continue was by turning it into a bloodspattered take on The Three Stooges. The movie&apos;s not scary, it&apos;s mildly atmospheric, and Elsie Fisher is okay as Lila, but the movie has the same problems as other attempts to revive a series that keeps getting revived only to die a few minutes afterwards.",

      "reviewBody": "Throughout history there has been hardships for African Americans. Slavery, human rights, discrimination, and racism have been very obvious problems for them. Although they have gained their human rights and slavery has been abolished, discrimination and racism are still around in the twenty-first century. Within the romantic drama Save The Last Dance directed by Thomas Carter, 2001, it lets its viewers see and recognize what people are still like to this day when dealing with different races such as white and black. \n\nWithin this movie the main character Sara wants to be a ballerina. Her mother died in a car accident on her way to see her perform, in attempt to get into Sara Lawrence University. She had to move in with her father who is a struggling musician and live in a rundown apartment, in Chicago. Sara&apos;s new school is mainly of African American descent and she is the minority. She makes friends with a girl named Chenille and starts adopt some things that Chenille does in order to fit in. \n\nChenille has a brother Derek. Derek and Sara fall in love and it is hard for them because they get a lot of problems just because they are in interracial couple. Sara and Derek both get into fights defending themselves from their peers and friends. The explanation for Chenille to Sara about why she shouldn&apos;t be with Derek was because she was white. She said that since Sara was white, she was taking one of the only good men left for the black woman. This is complete discrimination against Sara, even thought Chenille is her best friend there in Chicago.\n\n. Sara who grew up in the southwest, was not used to this ghetto Chicago area. She was taught how to dance like everyone else, and started to listen to the same music as they did, so she would fit in and have a good time. Her best friend from home doesn&apos;t think it&apos;s even possibly for Sara to find a guy down where she is because no one is white. She asks questions such as, &quot;Have you seen anyone get shot yet?&quot; Such questions and statements show that the low class status of this neighborhood is discriminated against. \n\nSave The Last Dance portrays the discrimination that still going on during this day and age. Gun fights, death, clubs, music, romance, tragedy, dancing, and racism are all present within this movie. The lower class Chicago area shows how dangerous things can be. The events that happen between the Sara and Derek and other events within this movie truly show how America is still discriminatory towards people."

      "name": "Stirring depiction of cops on the edge, this may just be Fuqua&apos;s Finest.",
      "reviewBody": "Brooklyn&apos;s Finest tells three respective tales of a trio of very different people more broadly connected to the police force of New York City; three people who each alike want &apos;out&apos; of their respective lives and lifestyles within the force, three people who live and operate in very different capacities therein the force, but look forward to the new ventures and pastures to follow thereafter their leaving. The film is a masterstroke of crime drama storytelling, a film whose runtime is never too long and whose sheer scale is never overwhelming; a film whose ability to balance each strand, ranging from everyday &apos;on-the-beat&apos; cops to undercover narcotics agents, is close to faultless. As far as American thrillers that may or may not contain a good deal of second unit stuff go, it is a breath of fresh air; an appealing, story driven piece with any one of its three strands most likely making decent enough features on their own.\n\nDirector Antoine Fuqua establishes the uncompromising characteristics that dominate the nature of his film&apos;s world during the opening scene, an exchange set in the confines of a parked car in the dead of night. One man speaks to another about how he was justified in recently breaking the law out of self defence. The other man, Ethan Hawke&apos;s Detective named Sal Procida, then proceeds to shoot him dead, but only for the large amount of ill-gotten money he had with him – something which will ease his financial woes made apparent out of his unhealthy wife and large family who&apos;re all living in a building unfit for them. Above anything else, it is a perfect opening to Procida&apos;s strand; a strand built on moral grey areas and he loots and kills for sake of someone else&apos;s struggles. Waking up not so far away is Richard Gere&apos;s character, he too is a police officer named Eddie Dugan; a single man who sleeps with whisky beside his bed and unloads an empty pistol into his mouth upon getting up. The man is not far from retirement and in a bad state. Finally, Don Cheadle is an undercover narcotics agent named &quot;Tango&quot; Butler; a man deep in the world of housing project-set, African American run drug rings whose efficiency and professionalism is epitomised in a slick, singular take as the camera glides through their interior base of operations from the quasi perspective of Cheadle himself.\n\nFuqua toys with his audience in so much he allows for the least intelligent; least likable and probably most aggressive of the three, in Procida, to want what&apos;s best for other people moreover himself. In providing this character with a family, it allows for Hawke&apos;s character to occupy the screen without risk of our interest or fondness for the man waning; it allows for his story to play out without the danger of it transferring into an anonymous, bland tale of an anti-hero undeserving of his job title going through the motions. That&apos;s not to say his is the best of the three, for Butler&apos;s story about working undercover and the apparent brethren he shares with those shady delinquents, as relationships with his police superiors wane, is often shattering. Wanting away from this life of constant fear and danger, he learns the only way to do such a thing is to bring in the boss of the entire outfit: Wesley Snipes&apos; gangster named Caz.\n\nThe reemergence of Snipes is a curious detail, a man who himself has recently served time in prison and here plays someone who is fresh out and back amongst his kin anyway. Seeing him turn up carries with it an odd air of realism: as if akin to his character suddenly reappearing amidst his own here on set, so too is Caz the wanted man who can finally be nailed by a federal department if Butler plays it right. In this regard, the casting is a masterstroke, and it is impressive that the sudden reappearance of the actor does not soften the impact of the film up to this point nor beyond it.\n\nThere are thoughts and writings that, in recent years, and something born out of the events of 9/11 in New York City, those more broadly orientated towards jobs in the fire department or police force often always come in for heroic depictions when featuring in American films. Some, the likes of Ladder 49 and such, have almost exclusively revolved around said folk in said roles. Jim Sheridan&apos;s 2010 remake of a Danish film entitled &quot;Brothers&quot; inexplicably featured a composition of a fire station façade during its opening montage, a shot you might say was designed, sub-consciously or otherwise, to implement both a sad and romanticised tone from the off. The film is not about firemen – far from it, but it&apos;s meant to induce melancholia what better way than to exploit the iconography of a fire station. If you want to see it in this particular way, you might read Fuqua&apos;s film as a piece going past all of that and cutting to the grit of the thing: a New York City-set project about those in roles depicted in less than flattering ways and living less than heroic lifestyles where previously we&apos;ve witnessed otherwise. However you might see it, the film is a more than substantial effort .",

      "reviewBody": "This one seemed to pass without notice in the theaters which is what I figured it deserved, but upon seeing it some time later on video I was surprised at how much fun this buddies on the road flick really is. \n\n Goofy is, for the most part, the lighthearted walking disaster we&apos;d expect him to be.  But surprsingly enough, he shows a serious range of emotion, and actually pulls it off.  You really can sense his devotion to his son, Max, and you never have to remind yourself that Goofy would have ever been anything but a deeply caring father. It just works naturally as a genuine extension of his gregarious character.  Max himself is believably adoloscent, primarily concerned with getting asked to parties and getting the pretty girl to notice him and hoping his father doesn&apos;t publicly humiliate him (which he does, frequently), until his dad forces him along on a fishing trip which becomes a test of conscience for the both of them.  The movie mixes Goofy&apos;s classic slapstick comedy with serious drama and seems to know just when to switch gears to keep from getting too melodramatic or losing sight of the conflict at the center of the story.  In the end, the dramatic bits feel surprisingly honest and human and the comedy is, as I said, classic Goofy schtick.  It was made when Disney thought EVERYthing they did had to be a musical, but the songs here work into the story fairly easily, and a couple are even catchy.\n\nThe only sad part is that the age group which could probably stand to learn the most from it will unequivocally find it &quot;uncool&quot;.  Oh well, the younger set as well as more mature people who love to laugh will find it plenty entertaining."

      "reviewBody": "Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn&apos;t quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on. The acting is astonishing, the writing superb, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music, riveting the whole way. Brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption.\n\nThe first moment I knew I was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning. Like he did with Hustle and Flow, Brewer lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically. The 70&apos;s aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema&apos;s best. From here we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both Lazarus and Rae, each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally cross. The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose. Rae&apos;s boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and Laz&apos;s wife leaves him for his brother. Each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situationRae to sex and Laz to the bottle. Only when Rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with God and that of the flesh and the pain it has brought him. There are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with his captive/patient. You never really look at the setup as comical or unrealistic because he sells what he is doing so well. Also, the character of Rae is not chained up for very long, despite what the trailers would have you believe. The situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day or two. As for that chained girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I never really saw her as anything special, but this role is a true breakthrough for her. This girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down. Any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and itches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away. Her nymphomania is not for pleasure, but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids. Ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism. Mention must also be made of Justin Timberlake, again showing some real acting talent. Where this guy came from I have no clue, but hopefully he will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music he churns out.\n\nWhile not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan still ranks equally to it, in my mind, because when it is on, it is spectacular. Towards the end we have a truly enthralling sequence with &quot;This Little Light of Mine&quot; singing out, and earlier, the interaction between captive and captor, when the chain is first introduced, shows some top-notch work. The truly magical moment, though, is when Jackson sings (yes that is him throughout, like it was Terrence Howard in Hustle) the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the lights flicker. If I don&apos;t see a more beautifully shot sequence all year, I won&apos;t be surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. One thing I think I really enjoy with Brewer&apos;s work is the fact that he doesn&apos;t show sinners becoming redeemed heroes. Instead he shows us that no matter how bad you have been, or how bad life has been, everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people. We don&apos;t have saints here, but fallible people looking to right their ship. If the course stays true or if it falls back into darkness, no one really knows, but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could.",

I&apos;ll start off with the positives.\n\nThe acting on the whole isn&apos;t that bad. Walter Matthau did a good job as Mr. Wilson as did Robert Stanton, Lea Thompson and Joan Plowright, but I think that Mason Gamble steals the show as the most likable title character who got the personality and characterization right. Even his chemistry with Walter Matthau was decent. Also, Christopher Lloyd was very sinister as the main villain and he steals the show as well. The scenery is nice and it has some nice cinematography. I also liked the music from Jerry Goldsmith. Not the best here, but still worth listening.\n\nHowever, the story, while having its nice moments, falls into the predictable zone and the script feels flat and would&apos;ve been so much better. Some of the humor gave me some chuckles (Dennis causing some trouble to Mr. Wilson and the baked beans farting scene), but some of them lacked wit and the pacing was very mediocre.\n\nOverall, uneven with it&apos;s story and pacing, but not as bad as some say it is. I&apos;m giving this a 6/10 because of it&apos;s likable cast and some nice scenery.",

Now I&apos;ve seen the movie and am stunned by the wasted talent and energy expended for what turned into another movie about rich, talented people who appear to have it all, but get sad and emotional just like the rest of us. They just talk about it a LOT more.\n\nThe film is beautifully photographed, but I have no idea what the format change and the black and white to color change accomplished. The acting was good, but rather than being shown that the characters are going through something emotional, we are told, All these immensely talented people seem to talk about is their feelings, not their motivations, plans and aspirations.\n\nLeonard Bernstein wrote and conducted some of the most memorable music of the 20th century. He singlehandedly (with help from Bugs Bunny) kept interest in classical music alive when jazz and rock were kings. But we learn nothing of this in this film. Bernstein&apos;s talents and accomplishments are presented as facts, without exploration. What a waste."

      "reviewBody": "An interesting insight into the United States&apos; space program, beginning with the exploits of fighter pilot Chuck Yeager (Sam Shephard) and concluding with the dramatic flights of the first astronauts.\n\nThose astronauts - the Mercury 7 pilots - are a varied group of aviators and they are all pretty interesting guys. John Glenn (Ed Harris) gets favorable treatment in here among the group. Gordon Cooper might be the wildest with the cocky and humorous Dennis Quaid playing him. Overall, it&apos;s a good cast including not just the fliers but their wives. I also enjoyed Scott Glenn as Alan Shepard and Barbara Hershey as Yeager&apos;s wife.\n\nYeager&apos;s feats were perhaps the most interesting and they set a fast tone to this 3-hour film as we witness him breaking several sound-barrier records prior to the formation of the astronaut team. Then we are treated to a long-but-interesting segment of how those first astronauts were trained.\n\nThe only unnecessary and ludicrous parts of this film were the ones on Lyndon Johnson, where they made him into a total fool. It was as if the screen writers had a personal vendetta against him, to make him look almost like a cartoon figure. And the bit with the Australian Aborigines smacks too much of Hollywood&apos;s love affair with tribal religions. I sincerely doubt some sparks from a fire on earth could be seen miles and miles above in space.\n\nAt any rate, this was an informative look at a period in our history than came-and-went way too fast. Sad to say, most people know very little about those first astronauts, who were true heroes. At least this film gives them their due, as well as to Yeager, who deserved this tribute, too",

This is not a limitation but instead the strength of the Movie itself; it&apos;s all about guided imagination. The dialogues push your figurative skills to build this outdoor world that is intentionally not shown to you. \n\nThere has been a lot of background work/preparation for this Film and it&apos;s all visible in the final product.\n\nThe director did a great job alternating long moments of high tension with some short funny ones to engage the audience.\n\nI do consider this Movie very unique and original but you might find some similarities with Locke and perhaps also Phone Boot where a series of phone calls is the actual stage.\n\nUnmissable title for 2018\n\nBravo!",

This movie tried so hard to emulate others of a genre, the classic revenge flick.... but fails miserabl. I didn&apos;t find myself attached to any character or empathetic, sympathetic, or even just rooting for anyone at any given moment including the star of the movie. The pacing is too slow. The action is almost comical. I&apos;m guessing it was meant to be that way, but unlike DC movies that pull it off this was just laughable... I was so disinterested that even by the climactic end it was just going through the paces to see who lives and who dies. Hollywood forgets that great writing makes great movies.... and the writing for this was juvenile, not creative and simply not entertaining... I had higher hopes for something written by and produced by Sylvester Stallone, who knows action movies.",

      "reviewBody": "Years after he and his sister survived a climbing accident where their father died, Peter and Annie Garrett find themselves on K2 for different reasons.  Peter is on the foothills taking pictures for National Geographic, while Annie is part of the documentary crew with playboy millionaire Elliot Vaughn, who is aiming to reach the summit in time to promote the launch of his new airline.  However when a storm comes in., most of the party are killed with only Elliot, Annie and leader Tom surviving in a crevice. Peter puts together a rescue mission, led by veteran Montgomery Wick.\n\nIt is just this film&apos;s bad luck that I watched it only a matter of days after I saw the much better Touching The Void.  That film had me on the edge of my seat with my mouth agape at times with a story of a climbing accident and the aftermath.  However Vertical Limit doesn&apos;t go for realism at any point.  The plot is a real mess; it doesn&apos;t risk having it&apos;s thrills from the effects of the mountain so it also adds a traditional bad guy and a `wages of fear&apos; twist involving the climbers carrying nitro in their backpacks.  That&apos;s not to say the film doesn&apos;t have exciting moments - the opening scene is very dramatic and powerful (despite O&apos;Donnell&apos;s crap wide-eyed acting) but it never reaches that again.  Instead, it settles for effect shots of climbers hanging over great heights etc.  These are visually impressive and they do manage to get a sense of urgency to them but it never lasts long.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame, because Cliffhanger was enjoyable and Void showed that the real drama can come from just the mountain itself, however here it keeps adding more stuff to try and force drama out of the situation.  The lack of real characters is a problem - instead we have very wide clichés almost; `dudes&apos;, wise old men, ruthless billionaires, sexy mountain chick and clean cut siblings.  Aside from the opening sequence, it is hard to feel an emotional connection to any of them and, as the latest disposable actor hangs over a drop awaiting the chop I was more focused on how good it looked rather than nerves over the outcome.  O&apos;Donnell is as bland as he often can be and didn&apos;t impress me at all; likewise Tunney was a bit `all-American&apos; for my taste.  Paxton could have been sending up Richard Branson if he hadn&apos;t been playing it so straight.  In a similar vein, Glenn would have been better if he&apos;d put his tongue in his cheek and acknowledged how daft his character was!  The support cast or `drop monkeys&apos; as I call them are an average enough bunch but the film basically kills them off one by one like a horror movie - to much audience apathy I might add.\n\nOverall this is an OK film if you can just turn off your brain and enjoy the vertigo-inducing effects.  However with no good plot, dialogue or characters it will be very difficult for anyone to really get involved in the film beyond this aspect.  I can only plea to you to seek out a film with a fraction the budget of this and that&apos;s Touching The Void.  It is a true story with no digital effects but it is a similar setting but much, much better."

That said, they didn&apos;t go too overboard with how the film was going to end.\n\nThere were a few carefully placed lectures for the real footballers in the film, lets hope they understand the warnings.\n\nI went with the missus and she loved the film. And she hates footie!!! The only bit I didn&apos;t quite get was the timeline. NUFC only had a few games left in the season but so much time seemed to pass by. I wasn&apos;t convinced.\n\nBut if you want a good film to watch then you wouldn&apos;t go too far wrong by having a look at this. It is far better than some of the rubbish this year.\n\nrecommended.",

      "reviewBody": "I can remember reading the book on which this story was based many years ago when I was in High School and being engrossed by the story. The movie version is no less engrossing, the entire story being made absolutely gut-wrenching by the fact that it&apos;s true. A South American rugby team is stranded in the remote heights of the Andes after a plane crash and has to find a way to survive the freezing temperatures, their injuries and a variety of other challenges (not the least of which is a lack of food.) The acting in it is good, but the situation itself becomes the focus rather than the actors, and so I can&apos;t really say that anyone in particular stood out to me, but that doesn&apos;t come across as a weakness here. After all, the story of survival was a story of teamwork; a &quot;star&quot; to the movie would have detracted from that.\n\nThis is literally gut-wrenching stuff, and I&apos;m surprised it doesn&apos;t have a higher rating. It is not an easy movie to watch at times. The injuries are graphically portrayed, the suffering of the injured very realistic and the ultimate solution to the food problem will upset some people (but, in spite of what I&apos;ve heard some say about this movie, it isn&apos;t the focus of the story. It&apos;s just an example of what had to be done to survive in an impossible situation.) It also has a surprisingly strong spiritual component to it.\n\nTruly excellent.\n\n10/10",

With Johnny Depp as the star, what else could you want? Apart from being a satire, it&apos;s an entertaining and hysterical, relatable satire. It takes a lot of skill to take a concept that could so easily teeter from funny to ridiculous, and while certain parts of the film seem to be heading towards that thin barrier, they always save face at the last minute. The movie doesn&apos;t just ride on Johnny Depp&apos;s talent, either. Every member of the cast displays a genuine understanding of the somewhat SNL-esque humour required to make everything work. I&apos;ve yet to meet someone face to face that has not seen this movie and truly enjoyed it for what it is: something wonderful."

I really thought this movie was funny in my point of view. The music in this film is probably the best music in any film to me because i love trance and house music so this was a good movie to watch. In the movie Steve and Doug dont even look like brothers but they sure act like it. I love how they do slow moving shots. makes you laugh and wanna watch at the same time wondering what is going to happen. One of the best parts of this movie are the lines, like did you grass my butt, or you outta town you new, aiight. There are plenty of them in the movie and i even use them in everyday life cause its just funny. This movie should be ranked higher in the imdb. In my opinion i give it a 10 rating."

      "reviewBody": "I saw an advanced screening of Charlie Bartlett at my school with a Q&amp;A session with the writer and director last April, and I must say, I haven&apos;t enjoyed a movie this much in a VERY long time.\n\nAnton Yelchin is Charlie Bartlett, a young rich boy who has just gotten kicked out of his private school for forging driver&apos;s licenses for his fellow students in an attempt to gain some acceptance. As a last resort, his strange mother, played wonderfully by Hope Davis, puts him into public school. At first, he is treated horribly as the &apos;new boy&apos;, until he appoints himself as the school psychiatrist and pharmacist, and the students begin to love him, fulfilling his dreams of popularity. Meanwhile, he begins an intimate relationship with Principal Goldberg&apos;s daughter, leading to many conflicts between Charlie and the principal.\n\nAnton Yelchin portrays Charlie flawlessly - the best part was when he got high off of Ritalin - and Kat Dennings was just beautiful. Hope Davis, as always, played his eccentric mother wonderfully, and Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely great.\n\nFor any of you who are wondering about Mark Rendall&apos;s role in this film, he has a relatively large part as Kip Cromwell, the unpopular, depressed boy who comes to Charlie for help. I must say he is AMAZING. He does a beautiful job expressing his character&apos;s many and layered emotions.\n\nAnyhow, GREAT MOVIE!!! Do whatever you can to see it as soon as you can. I would give it an 11/10 if I could!!",

      "reviewBody": "Heists, robberies, thieves all seems very attractive words when it comes to movie business. And some names like Italian Job, Oceans 11 have proved to be the brim of excitement and thrill and made movie history bit more vivid and interesting. However not always this is true. Even though some movies come out with stunning trailers and impressive cast they fail to pull out the obvious, the story and the drama. And I think &apos;Takers&apos; fail in the same spot.\n\n&apos;Takers&apos; is a story about a gang of thieves who live luxurious life from the money they manage to rob. Well informed, organized and trained in their livelihood of taking what belongs to others, they seem to know what they are doing. But one day their history starts to bite them in their back and meanwhile a restless cop starts to sniff his way up to their doorstep. In between thundering loud bullet exchanges and lightning fast pursuits &apos;Takers&apos; have its moments of thrill and suspense. And even the cast is not bad. Eye candy for the woman viewers for sure with Paul Walker and Hayden Christensen in front seats of the whole game the movie, but has poor female characters presentation. The hot Zoe Saldana represents a bit of woman on the movie but her face time is quite unnoticeable.\n\nEven though the action, cinematography, cast is quite good there are certain key areas where &apos;Takers&apos; fail to deliver. One big failure is the plot. There is no magic in it. Looks Cliché and quite predictable if you are a fan of heist movies all along. And the character development is very poor. You hardly get to know any character so you don&apos;t actually feel anything towards them when the story throws emotional moments at you. So the impressive cast is not actually worth it after all.\n\n&apos;Takers&apos; is a thrill ride with a big emptiness surrounding it. I won&apos;t consider watching it again unless it&apos;s free on HBO and its a lazy jobless day.",

Let me just say, that I thoroughly enjoyed the film. It is funny, thoughtful (but not overdramatised), clever and sensitive at the same time. Finally a film where love, a man and a woman and the relationship between them is treated with respect, gentleness and is elevating, and refreshing. The script is great, the acting is superb, the dialogues, those subtle gestures, looks, smiles are all in place. Nothing overdone just treated with natural care. What little glitches there are in this movie simply add to its charm. Watching this film is a great experience, it&apos;s great entertainment. I warmly recommend watching it.",

      "reviewBody": "I am struck at the complexity of this film, and the reflective nature of its narrative structure. Action or events as a device to look at our natures, choices, motives, drives and dreams. And let&apos;s not stop there. How about actors acting theater scenes, and throw in a play within a play to boot, for good measure.\n\nI know I sound somewhat critical above, and under less skilled hands, such criticism would be warranted. But not here. THE SALESMAN is compelling from beginning to end. And using Arthur Miller&apos;s iconic play, THE DEATH OF A SALESMAN, works so well to comment on these character&apos;s dreams, failings, nobility and humanity. \n\nA dream -- or rather dreams -- shattered by a single, accidental, innocent incident. At the end of the journey, of our own Odyssey, whether we arise as a hero or a victim depends on our choices, our attitudes, our sheer willfulness for goodness or our tendency for self-destruction. To me, this movie raised these issues, and more. I loved it. Compelling through and through, and from a most-gifted, cinematically articulate director.\n\nScoring the different elements of the film objectively, 1 to 4:\n\nScript/Story: 4, loved it. And all this set against a backdrop of a crackling, fall building; a house of cards, if you will.\n\nCinematography/Visual Effects: 3.5. Well shot. Close shots heightened the tension.\n\nEditing: 3.5. Well edited; kept the pacing of a natural thriller, but lacked the cheesiness of one.\n\nSound Effects: 3, competent sound mixing\n\nMusical Score: 3; frankly do not recall any musical score underscoring the film. This is sad as I should have noticed. Was there one?\n\nPerformances: 4, extremely strong performances. Great ensemble work, and standout work by the two leads, and the old man, too. I was particularly touched by the scene between the two men when the lead told the old man to take off his shoes. This scene was so effectively shot. Slow pacing of the camera capturing every quiver of both performances. Wow.\n\nProduction Design: Sets, Locations, Costumes, etc.: 2.5; my complaint here deals with the shots from the theater itself where DEATH OF A SALESMAN was being performed. Needed something more here. \n\nWould you recommend this movie to a friend? Absolutely; a fine work of cinema. And extremely provocative. Well written; well shot; well delivered. Most highly recommended. Strong Oscar contender for Best Foreign Language Film.",

It drew me in to its world without me hardly noticing it - a world of ultra-realism, burnished, you must say, by some quite incredible performances from Katie Jarvis and the rest of the cast.\n\nOne night of disturbed sleep after watching it and I am still in their world, out on the bleak and beautiful flatlands bordering Essex and London which so many people speed through every day as they journey between London and mainland Europe on the Eurostar trains. I myself have taken that journey a few times and wondered what the people&apos;s lives were like who lived in this strange landscape where London has parked so much of the stuff that it doesn&apos;t want to see - the giant container terminals, the power plants and the chemical works.\n\nFish Tank perhaps gives a taste of those lives, but it does much more than that. Especially it gives us a heroine who we can&apos;t help caring for deeply, despite and partly because she is on the outside so nasty, rude and violent. Through some of the things she gets up to as she wonders around we see a natural love of life bursting to get out though. We also have an attractive and kind man come into the picture who, through his natural goodness, offers an outlet for her yearnings for understanding, fun, and intimacy.\n\nThe story starts off slowly as we get to know 15-year old Mia, her family and the wider (and very limited) world around her. But it picks up and becomes tautly gripping at times - and it never slips into sentimentality or offers false redemption. It is all the better for that.",

There was only one other man at the screening and he was obviously feeling a little out of place as well (although he seemed relieved to see me walk in). I was expecting a teen soap opera, but what the movie delivered was quite different. This movie is more like a modern-times &quot;Little Women&quot; or a teen girl version of &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;. In other words, it&apos;s something that I haven&apos;t seen any sign of for decades....an intelligent drama aimed at teenage girls. My response to seeing this movie was similar to how i felt after seeing &quot;Babe&quot;. I know this is an odd comparison, but both were thoughtful, intelligent movies aimed at a target audience that is usually fed cinematic rubbish. The elements of good film-making are on full display here. Strong acting, sure-handled directing, terrific writing....everything that makes a movie great. If you are a teenage girl or have one in your life, this is an absolutely must-see movie. If you don&apos;t, you&apos;ll still have a good time.",

      "reviewBody": "After Ken Loach&apos;s latest film &quot;I, Daniel Blake&quot; (2016) took home the most prestigious film award of the year, Palme d&apos;Or at Cannes earlier this summer, there has been a lot of discussion or at least anticipation of discussion on the film. The Guardian, for one, published a long article where people from all walks of life shared their differing opinions on the film. As a fierce story of social relevance, telling about an ailing carpenter whose life goes to pieces in the vast sea of bureaucracy, &quot;I, Daniel Blake&quot; is bound to be criticized for being didactic and demagogic as it hits the commercial screens. Some will fall in love with the film for its honest authenticity, while others will be put off by its unapologetic directness. \n\nThe film begins with the title character, Daniel Blake going through an assessment in the unemployment office after his doctor has deemed him unfit for work due to a heart condition. Unfortunately, Daniel ends up in a paradoxical position, the likes which Kafka could have devised, where he is not concerned unhealthy enough to apply for sickness benefit and has to therefore apply for job seeker&apos;s allowance, coercing him into a pointless cycle of searching for jobs he cannot really take. In the middle of this absurd jungle of gray offices and red tapes, Daniel befriends Katie, a single mother of two in a similar situation. Daniel&apos;s cardinal sin in the bureaucratic world is his refusal to play by its rules, to fake and to pull the strings where needed. \n\nLoach is known for his simplicity in both style and narrative without ever coming close to minimalism. His simplicity is of a different kind, a simplicity of the heart on the level of the subject matter which is often social by nature. This simplicity gives room for the unfolding of story and character in their natural state which is of the utmost importance for Loach&apos;s intentions. At times warm and funny, at others raw and brutal, the story of &quot;I, Daniel Blake&quot; is hard to be dismissed for its authenticity. It will likely speak to most people as do the great realist novels of the 19th century. It is a simple voice with real thought and emotion behind it, saying something of relevance, straight out and loud. While the title of the film might pave way for quasi-libertarian interpretations of Loach&apos;s critique of the social benefits system, his intentions could not be clearer to those who have seen the film. The titular character is merely someone to carry the torch of solidarity; to Loach and others, he represents a mass of millions. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that the film &quot;intervenes in the messy, ugly world of poverty with the secular intention of making us see that it really is happening, and in a prosperous nation.&quot; This is the simplicity which gives Loach&apos;s cinema its moral aura.\n\nAlthough many may feel put off by the film&apos;s direct social message and strong moral pathos, which can feel didactic or even demagogic at times, and it will not find its dearest fan in yours truly either, I think the film deserves acclaim for its integrity. The film does not hide its rhetoric or its message. After all, its &quot;leftist agitation&quot; may not be stranger than the ideology of upper middle class family life propagated by contemporary popular culture. The way I see it, &quot;I, Daniel Blake&quot; is more a personal expression of worry and concern rather than manufactured propaganda with an impersonal agenda. At worst the film might be preachy or sentimental, but at best it is the most authentic thing Ken Loach has done since &quot;My Name Is Joe&quot; (1998), a parallel work in the truest sense of the word. To put it bluntly, I am glad that &quot;Jimmy&apos;s Hall&quot; (2014) did not end up being the legacy Loach left for cinema; but &quot;I, Daniel Blake&quot; could very well be just that.",

      "reviewBody": "Although there are several films that I would rank in the top ten best of all time, this is probably my favorite, and is a good past time to watch that never lets me down. As many times as I&apos;ve seen this film (and it&apos;s a lot), it never fails me; with tears, laughter and excellent acting and reality. Julia Roberts, as I recall was nominated for her portrayal as a young woman with diabetes, and in my opinion, should have won for this and not for &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;. But, the real gem and overlooked one in the movie is Sally Field. This is by far and away, her best role and performance she ever snagged, and nailed, and I rank her performance in this as one of my top five best performances in motion picture history of all time.\n\nAll the characters and performances in this are excellent, including one such, by Daryl Hannah, who I don&apos;t care for, but love in this movie. In fact, her character Anell, is the only role I&apos;ve ever liked her in, and applaud her work in it.\n\nAmong the cast there are very few men, but my favorite is Tom Skerrit, who plays Sally Field&apos;s husband, and father to Julia Robert. Shirley MaClain, Olympia Dukakis, and Dolly Parton are the other three co-stars, that follow behind the three previous, and all make their characters unique.\n\nThe basis of the film, is a beauty parlor, and although it might sound hokey, it&apos;s really not. Some might call it a chick flick, but I have to say that I know men have even gotten teary-eyed from this film. It&apos;s wonderfully directed, only in that, it makes you feel apart of the never ending friendship that&apos;s between this group of women. The experiences that they have and the trials and tribulations they go through. Although not the whole movie is set in the hair salon, a good portion of the film is, but it is done in just the right amount, and is written very well.\n\nI recommend it for girls of all ages, and men who want to impress their girlfriends with a great flick for a Friday night. It is one of the best films of all time, and if for no other reason, you should watch this merely to see the performance Sally Field gives, because it is amazing.",

Wild Child is simply a happy movie. It&apos;s ridiculous and at times embarrassing but it&apos;s also funny and wonderful. No matter how young or old I&apos;ve been it has always left me with a smile on my face. It&apos;s very early 2000s and occasionally outdated but brilliant in its own right. Wild Child is a light rom-com with friendship and mischief and if you go in knowing what you&apos;ll get you won&apos;t be disappointed. In my eyes, this movie will always remain as an instant pick me up, no matter what the critics say.",

      "reviewBody": "Seldom does one go to a movie with high expectations and ends up having them fulfilled, but Becoming Jane is an exception in this case. I was charmed by Anne Hathaway&apos;s turn in Brokeback Mountain and The Devil Wears Prada and couldn&apos;t really understand the outcry resulting in her being cast as Jane Austen and after having watched the movie I know for sure Anne Hathaway was the right person for the role.\n\nHot on the heels of 2005&apos;s Pride and Prejudice this movie offers a look into the early years of a spirited Jane Austen and her encounter with a man who could have formed the basis of one of her most famous literary characters Mr Darcy.\n\nI have to say this movie is without a doubt one of the BEST period films I have ever seen. Not only is it visually stunning but the performances from everyone are superb.\n\nMaggie Smith a delightful as the shrewd old Aunt.\n\nJulie Walters excellent as the mother who would give anything to knock some sense into her daughter ( Jane Austen that is ).\n\nAnna Maxwell Martin is also very good as the sister and confidante of Jane Austen.\n\nThe director Julian Jarrold has done a wonderful job of making an amazing movie that will appeal to all generations.\n\nAnd finally the two very charming leads who are the very heart of the movie : Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy. In one word both are AWESOME. James although has little screen time then Anne makes you understand the sheer cockiness and arrogance of Tom Lefroy, from his live free attitude in life to his transformation as a man who begins to care for Jane Austen.His chemistry with Anne Hathaway is sizzling and a very important factor in maintaining the movie&apos;s momentum.\n\nAnd at last to the leading lady Anne Hathaway. The lady is a marvel as Jane Austen, her determination and spark is vividly captured by Anne in what can be called a very career defining performance. Not only does one feel the pain for Jane but one does marvel at what holds her together and her writing makes her pull through in life.It is Anne Hathaway&apos;s spirited portrayal of the literary icon that forms the essence of the movie.\n\nFrom her determination to write and her heart break to her feisty attitude to succeed as a writer is uniquely captures by the young actress. One can&apos;t really find the exact words to describe the actress&apos;s performance as Jane Austen , which is if simply put great.\n\nThis movie has the makings to become the period drama of the year. A fine job by the actors and entire crew of the movie for giving us an insight to what could have been very important years in the young authors life.\n\nA delight to watch in every sense 8/10",

In this era of cheap computer effects it&apos;s really refreshing to see a movie where the special effects are done the old fashioned way. For some bizarre reason I really like Vampires. The plot is somewhat clichéd, the acting is nothing special and yet... I find myself watching this movie over and over again. Somehow the idea of a secret military force funded by the church, dedicated to fighting vampires is thrilling even though I&apos;m not a religious man. I suppose it harkens back to the day of witch hunters. James Woods is great as the grim, dedicated man sworn to destroy all vampires and as the true shocker, the generic Baldwin appearing in the movie does a really good job as well! If you like gory movies, check it out!",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie when I was in college in Colorado Springs, Colorado when it came out in 1984.  Many people dismiss this movie at best as either a teen fantasy or at worse as a right-wing maniac&apos;s delusional vision of the future.  Yes, it is a teen movie, but there&apos;s a bit more to it than that. I&apos;m basically writing this for those of you who either weren&apos;t born or too young to remember those days.  I grew up in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Anything mildly patriotic was regarded in bad taste.  So when John Millius and his friends decided to make this patriotic teen movie about resistance fighters fighting invaders from the Evil Empire, he was just tapping into the frustration that many people (including myself) felt at that time.  The scene I remember most vividly is the one when Patrick Swazye shoots the young Russian political officer in the Chevy Blazer.  The audience consisted mostly of guys from nearby Fort Collins and Peterson AFB, and they gave this scene a standing ovation.  In this post 11 September world, it&apos;s hard to imagine a time when, during the Cold War, flying the flag or loving your native land made many people think you were either a Nazi or a member of the John Birch Society.  Now this film isn&apos;t &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; or &quot;Fail-Safe.&quot;  It&apos;s just a movie that was made at a time after we had lost a war and many in the world regarded the USA as a paper tiger. That&apos;s all."

      "reviewBody": "I saw this during a period of extreme emotional stress, probably the best possible mode. It was also surrounded by my listening to &quot;Big Fish,&quot; Lynch&apos;s book, read by himself. The contrast is astonishing: Lynch&apos;s banal aphorisms in the book with rich, multilayered cinematic literacy in the film. Yet another lesson in relative articulation and the notion that an artist often is the worst authority on himself.\n\nLet&apos;s have no mistake: this film is important. I place it on my list as one of the two films of 2006 that you must see.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot to say about this. I think I&apos;ll let others comment on Dern&apos;s attunements, and the general notion of the story having to do with guilt and sexual desire.\n\nI&apos;ll comment only on two aspects which struck me. The first was how Polish this movie is. Its Polish within the story of course: a good half of the action involves Poles. The plot device is a Polish curse that somehow bends time and causality. And there are some Polish locations as well.\n\nBut the thing is shot using Kieslowski&apos;s mannerisms. Its a peculiar style that to my knowledge no one else has used. It focuses on two motions: that of the environment as space which governs and changes. And that of the characters in motion, but situated in the spaces. With Kieslowski, he literally splits these in the writer&apos;s mind by having his writing partner handle the noir bits, the controlling fate, and he handling the independently sprouting human seeds within. Lynch handles both sides by imposing schizophrenia.\n\nBut its Polish in other ways too. The actor as Golem. The environment as interleaved worlds, each creating the others by being. Its a Kabbalistic concept. Both are characteristically Polish, usually associated with Polish Jews, but more deeply Polish. You can see how Lynch understands this because he quotes &quot;The Saragossa Manuscript,&quot; a Polish film about interweaving of kabbalistic worlds and the causal confusion that it brings.\n\nThe second thing is how he exploits this merger of folded narrative -- where actors write new worlds; layered emanations where worlds spawn others -- not parallel but linked in generative fate; geometric cosmology in which each act creates symmetries we encounter elsewhere.\n\nHe does all this by elaborating on the symmetries of cause. Ordinarily something causes something else, never backwards. Here it IS backwards, forwards, sideways -- all the eight dimensions that an advanced student of the Maharishi knows... causal symmetries that have a geometry that doesn&apos;t quite merge with the geometry of causality. Oddly, the story does make sense if you simply relax the causality a bit -- its much more accessible than the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; meander.\n\nI guess I should say that this is after the manner of the structure of &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot; Its not as elaborate of course. It didn&apos;t take 17 years and the deliberate intent of conflating all metaphors. But it is placed in a dream logic, a softening of the walls and hinges of what we make up as the logic of real life. Its Joycean through and through and not -- as some would say -- &quot;surreal&quot; as if anything not real is bent reality.\n\nI know of a few filmmakers who can work with these notions: Medem, Greenaway, Madden, Ruiz. This is the most delicate and focused I&apos;ve seen in a long, long while. You really must spend time with it. You must.\n\nHere&apos;s a serious piece of advice though. See Lynch&apos;s &quot;Rabbits&quot; episodes first, separately, ideally a week or so ahead. Take them in as a standalone piece, a remarkable piece of film. Some of it is in this film, excerpted, extended, reshot and literally entered by all the Dern characters. But you&apos;d be better having that anchor before starting this tempestvoyage.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this."

      "reviewBody": "THE GENERAL&apos;S DAUGHTER is movie that has been done before. But it knows this and is able to look past it&apos;s cliché&apos;s and have fun with the genre. A cop(Travolta) is called to an army base to investigate the death of a general&apos;s daughter after she has been raped and beat to death and left naked and tied to the ground with tent stakes. It&apos;s a ghastly sight and everyone wants him to get to the bottom of it as soon as possible. The problem is that EVERYONE has something to hide or is hiding someone who has something to hide. This has an all-star cast and they are terrific. The story is well written and the cast has some fun with it along the way. Director Simon West knows how to tell the story with a slight tongue and cheek flavor and still maintain the very serious nature of the subject matter. The action sequences are very well choreographed and the climax is pretty intense. So if you are looking for a familiar but really good, intense, and exciting action murder mystery THE GENERAL&apos;S DAUGHTER is well worth seeing. No matter if the critics thumbed their elitist nose&apos;s at it. They&apos;re loss is our average Joe&apos;s gain. ***1/2 out of 4.",

The apartment she moves alongside her daughter seems perfect at first . Dahlia carries her daughter to nearly school where the teacher (Camyn Manheim) teaches her and she , subsequently , hires a lawyer (Tim Roth) for the divorce . Soon , though , weird things start happening into house . Huge water stains appear on the ceiling and drip constantly , more water and oozing liquid into the rooms everyday . She calls the doorkeeper (Pete Postlehwaite) and the landlord (John C. Reilly) but they refuse to make anything about it . A child&apos;s red bag shows up in odd places and soon the child herself starts appearing and causing usual poltergeists phenomenon recreated with high grade special effects . Dahlia then discovers the origin of the specter .\n\nThis new version of Hideo Nakata film is plenty of screams , fear , suspense , thriller and results to be quite entertaining . The terror moments are delivered compactly and quietly with no fuss . The script copies exactly the Japan original movie without surprises . While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie , the plot stretches plausibility to the breaking point . Nice acting by Jennifer Connelly , she turned down the role of Paige in ¨House of wax¨ (2005) , another horror remake , in order to appear in this one . Colorful cinematography by Alfonso Beato , usual cameraman of Salles , and creepy musical score fitting to horror movie by Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks) . The motion picture was well realized by Walter Salles , in spite of little originality . Salles is the number one producer (City of God , Lower city) and director (Motorcycle diaries , Central Station , Behind the sun) from Brasil and recently making an American career . The flick will appeal to terror cinema buffs, well worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "There is only one word I can use to describe this &quot;existensial comedy&quot; by David O. Russell: insane. Here is a comedy with no real rules. A sense of brilliant madness lurks within every scene. Emotions run wild, actions are poorly motivated, people have no idea just what the hell they are doing! This is to be said about certain characters played by Jason Schwartzman, Jude Law, Mark Wahlberg, and Naomi Watts. These are characters who are in deep need of answers to their existence, and who are playing with ideas that they are not quite ready to tackle. But then you have Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, and Isabelle Huppert just kind of watching by the sidelines as the more experienced characters. By the end of the movie I couldn&apos;t help but think of how many other clients of theirs went through similar conflicts. That&apos;s the ultimate punchline. What a delight I Heart Huckabees is! \n\nThis is in no way at all your average comedy. Many philosophical theories are brought up throughout the film, but it&apos;s all done in a &quot;fun&quot; way. The film doesn&apos;t follow and preach any of the theories, only its characters do. I thought that was important because, well, that&apos;s what makes it so funny. It does not take itself seriously.\n\nThe acting is very...interesting. You have the younger actors like Wahlberg and Schwartzman really, really trying hard in hilariously over-the-top performances. To the exact opposite of that, you have Hoffman and Tomlin who don&apos;t even really try that hard at all. They don&apos;t have to. They&apos;re pros- actor wise and character wise. This imbalance in mood just adds and adds to the overflowing madness of I Heart Huckabees.\n\nThere is a lot of things wrong with the movie that seem to make it funnier and all the more enjoyable to watch. I had a smile on my face through the whole thing. I Heart Huckabees is indeed an acquired taste. People will love it, people will hate it, people will be totally indifferent to it, but I have no doubt that it will find its following.\n\nMy rating: 8/10",

      "name": "Story of a Southern Unionist rebellion and Reconstruction",
      "reviewBody": "I had read Prof. Bynum&apos;s excellent books about the Jones County rebellion and so had been looking forward to the movie. Though it, inevitably, changes the story (you&apos;d need a dozen hours to tell it completely), it remains faithful to the spirit of the rebellion and the characters of Newton and Rachel Knight.\n\nThere were a number of Unionist uprisings in the South during the Civil War (a fact that was carefully expunged from my history textbooks, growing up in the South, maybe to justify all the monuments celebrating the glorious Olde South that lurk around public parks and buildings to intimidate black Southerners - I guess). What other purpose could they possibly serve? To celebrate a defeat?\n\nThis movie finally points out the obvious: the Confederacy lost the war, but the planter class which owned the Confederacy did their damnedest to win the peace. Instead of being lynched like Mussolini, Confederate leaders returned to their lives, their plantations, just like the war had never happened. Even the slaves they lost were returned to them in the form of unpaid sharecroppers. The misery of the lives of freedmen is one of the strongest images to take away from this film, their alleged freedom snatched from them. No 40 acres and a mule to serve as some form reparation, they went on to endure a century of domestic terrorism at the hand of the KKK.\n\nThe movie itself is beautifully and sensitively acted and filmed. There are scenes of great brutality but which are never gratuitous. There are also scenes of great beauty. There are scenes which have enormous relevance to politics in America today where racism is the hallmark of one Presidential candidate and income inequality the hallmark of another.\n\nClaims by the radical left that this movie is about a &quot;white savior&quot; are just silly. If anything, Gary Ross has eliminated most of the real-life incidents which dealt with Newton Knight&apos;s own actions on behalf of freedmen, probably to make the film more palatable to the radical left who, like the extreme right-wing can never be satisfied anyway. I do wish the radical left, rather than criticizing well-intentioned liberals like Gary Ross, would attack the real enemy. The State of Mississippi still incorporates the Confederate flag in its state flag... and social justice warriors are quibbling about degrees of &quot;white saviordom&quot;? \n\nMatthew McConaughey hasn&apos;t put a foot wrong since Lincoln Lawyer and his performance here is among his best work. American actors are rarely convincing playing period roles but he totally inhabits the role - scraggly beard, greasy hair, terrible teeth and attitude. He looks like the daguerrotype of a tired and desperate Civil War soldier. Gugu Mbatha-Raw has flown too long under the radar: stunningly touching as an early 19th century biracial heiress in Belle and totally believable as a pop star headed for a nervous breakdown in Beyond the Lights, she brings a luminous quality to Rachel a resourceful woman who defined her own path despite the oppression of racist Southern culture.\n\nMahershala Ali&apos;s character won&apos;t be found in Prof. Bynum&apos;s books. The names of the maroons who fought with the Knight Company have been lost to history, so he is a composite character invented by Gary Ross. His character travels from runaway slave to armed insurgent to voting rights activist in Reconstruction. Ali imbues his character with wit, charm, warmth and extraordinary courage.\n\nKeri Russell is fine in a small role. She gives her heartbroken character dignity and resilience.\n\nHighly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Dolemite is my name&quot; is one of my favourite movies of the year so far along with Joker and Parasite. It&apos;s largely down to the career best performance by Eddie Murphy, who is simply mesmerising as Rudy Ray Moore. He brings so much energy to this role, along with his charm and humour. Eddie has never been this funny. Most of the jokes are raunchy so it might not be for everyone but it&apos;s impossible not to fall in love with Eddie in this film. I hope he is nominated in the best actor category at Oscars. He could even win it because he is that good.\n\nApart from Eddie, the film is full of brilliant performances, in particularly by Wesley Snipes who matches and sometimes steals the show from Eddie. It&apos;s a true ensemble. It&apos;s a shame that this movie is not getting a wide theatrical release because let me tell you if there is one film this year which needed to be seen on the big screen it&apos;s &apos;Dolemite Is My Name&quot;. A hilarious, heartfelt film which gives a really positive message to everyone who has a dream. A must-see crowd pleaser.",

His rendition of Everett Hitch made the whole movie more than worthwhile. He&apos;s a man of little words but great thought. He also an observant man, of things and people. He&apos;s loyal but with practicality. He knows what the two of them do and why they do it and he know enough about Virgil not to step on his toes. But he also knows when to say what he as to say and leave it at that. I&apos;m never that impressed by Renee Zellweger but in this movie she sort of fit in. 7/10",

One would be able to watch this film without ever having read or known the book and seen it as it&apos;s own film.\n\nThe film thrives on small scenes and nuances, moments of person to person contact, production design and cinematography, the all important score (which adds a great deal to the film). This delicate and complicated symbiosis between all aspects tactfully and poignantly creates the story, something missing from many movies these days which creates a tangible and effervescent emotional layer. Then the acting of one of the best ensembles to hit the screen in a long time. Keep an eye out for Susan Sarandon and Claire Daines in roles that ought to have been nominated along with Ryder. These actors create people that endear themselves to us, and make the film even more than it could have been.\n\nIt&apos;s a small scale masterpiece that will leave you in tears. The film is honest and true in it&apos;s portrayal of human emotion. It went from being an adaptation of the book to it&apos;s own story and portrayal of people and their lives. It&apos;s beautiful aesthetically and dramatically, and a real gem of a film.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one-of-a-kind movie and definitely a must for lovers of Van Gogh. I studied art, therefore I was very interested in seeing how they managed to produce new paintings using his technique. The result is visually striking. You can actually experience some of Van Gogh&apos;s paintings coming to life, which is in itself pretty amazing.\n\nHowever, a movie must also have a strong script, a good story to go with the visual. The plot is about Armand Roulin, son of Joseph Roulin - two frequent subjects of Van Gogh&apos;s portraits. In fact, the whole Roulin family, inclusive of mum Augustine and her other two children were painted several times by Van Gogh, while in Arles.\n\nJoseph was Van Gogh&apos;s postman and in the movie he entrusts Armand to deliver his last letter to brother Theo. Vincent and Theo&apos;s letters were published at the beginning of the last century, shedding light on their affectionate relationship, but not about Vincent&apos;s demise.\n\nTherefore, Armand sets out to investigate Vincent&apos;s last days. The tone is somber and melancholic, somehow clashing with the beautiful visuals. Van Gogh comes across as an enigmatic man who could be sweet and full joy one moment and despondent the next - maybe suffering from bi-polar disorder, but we&apos;ll never know.\n\nThe plot develops a bit slowly in the end we do not know much more of what we knew at the beginning, but for sure we can retain the memory of this fantastic pictorial voyage.",

I was surprised this didn&apos;t follow the usual &apos;mills &amp; boon&apos; formula with sisterly love hate peppered loosely. Certain references in particular to the shoe thread throughout kept the interest of the majority of girlie&apos;s around, but the evolving relationships of the main characters were finely crafted and kept the interest of non-chick-flicking shoe-loving shopaholic minority. The music was nice backdrop to the lives of Rose and Maggie, but for my money, the use of E.E. Cummings poems took this past the norm and into the quite enjoyable category.\n\nIf you&apos;re not a chick flick fan worth the viewing time.\n\nIf you are, well worth the entrance fee too.",

      "reviewBody": "My family and I saw We Are Marshall Christmas night. I grew up in a Marshall family (Mom &amp; Dad, M.U. grads; my oldest sister was in school at M.U. at the time of the plane crash, as well as her future husband). Dad worked in the newspaper business at the time; and my mom&apos;s father passed away the night of the crash (while we were glued to radio and T.V. reports from Huntington.)\n\nA year later, I was fortunate enough to see the Xavier game portrayed in the film at Fairfield Stadium in person. It is still the single most heart-stirring moment in sports I&apos;ve ever been around.\n\nAttending Marshall myself just a few short years after the tragedy, we cheered for first downs by the Thundering Herd and agonized through fighting to be just competitive. Not all were mindful of the journey.\n\nThe film seems to capture the shock of the crash on the school and the community and the hopelessness both experienced in the times immediately following the crash. Due to time restrictions and to keep the story moving, the struggle to come up with representative football players was kind of oversimplified in the film, but the men who did play in those years are just as important as the heroes of the winning era at Marshall decades later. Not sure if the real Jack Lengyel was as tongue in cheek as portrayed in the movie, but it seems to work.\n\nI think the movie will grow on people across the country not familiar with the story or who had no ties to Marshall/Huntington, in the vein of Hoosiers or Remember The Titans. My wife and sons have heard about it for years...that&apos;s why we wanted to experience the movie together.\n\nThe most incredible sports story I&apos;ll ever witness. I thought about the 75 when Marshall played in Detroit in the Motor City Bowl in 1999 and finished in the top 10 in the country. I think about them every time I visit the Marshall Student Center and see the 1970 team picture on the wall. I knew their names from the newspaper stories and the radio coverage of the era. It is quite a personal memory for me, and one I know I share with thousands, and now, many, many more.",

I guess it helps that I am a big fan of both Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman...their chemistry throughout the two films is priceless, a great comedy duo.  Terry Kiser couldn&apos;t be better as Bernie, given a role in which he really doesn&apos;t have to do anything...nonetheless, he gives us a hilarious performance.  And, you also gotta love Catherine Mary Stewart...she&apos;s just great, and Don Calfa is also brilliant.  The writer, Robert Klane (he co-wrote &quot;NATIONAL LAMPOON&apos;S EUROPEAN VACATION, previously) creates a wonderful story and atmosphere...and, he eventually helmed the direction on this film&apos;s sequel in 1993. Don&apos;t listen to that other airhead who reviewed this, with his &quot;set your alarm clock&quot; crap...what the hell does he know, anyway?  Yes, this film is &quot;stupid-comedy&quot;...and, that&apos;s why the film works.  A great summer movie. Recommended dosage: Repetitious viewings, ad nauseum.\n\nTake care!"

      "reviewBody": "I have been a fan of romantic comedies ever since I could remember. I just love the feeling that I get when I see happy endings not only in movies but also in real life. So when this movie came out, I immediately grabbed my friend to watch this because I couldn&apos;t hold my curiosity any longer. Kate Hudson, Ginnifer Goodwin, John Krasinski, and a Tom Cruise look alike that is Colin Egglesfield, very intimidating cast, yes? This is a very light romantic comedy, definitely not the most original one too cos its very predictable and like I said, very light. I love John Kransinski for the most part because he&apos;s the character that&apos;s in between everyone else, retaining the balance of the movie. I just find his sarcasm very charming, especially towards Darcy, although I&apos;m not sure what started this sort of &quot;feud&quot; between the two (haven&apos;t read the book). What I don&apos;t get though is how Darcy doesn&apos;t notice this thing between Rachel and Dex, until towards the end of the movie. Anyway, I still think the movie is lovely and a must watch for those of you out there who are hopelessly romantic! Its such a feel good movie that will leave you with one thing on your face. A smile! :) Happy viewing!",

      "reviewBody": "This film is centred on Ava Faulkner, an assassin with addiction problems and a desire to know why her victims are being targeted. This latter quirk bothers her employers. Duke, her direct superior and father figure wants to protect her but others, higher up, believe she is a liability. After an operation goes wrong due to faulty intelligence she suspects that her employers want her dead. Duke tries to persuade her that she is just being paranoid. If that weren&apos;t enough there are problems with her family; her ex-boyfriend Michael, who is now her sister&apos;s fiancé, has gambling problems which have led to large debts.\n\nI thought this started well and was intrigued by Ava&apos;s life as an assassin... I assumed that the plot would eventually lead to who her employers were and what their motives were. Instead it led to the unnecessary subplot involving Michael; this felt a distraction from the main story, as if the makers thought they had an hour&apos;s worth of material and needed to pad the film out to an hour and a half. It is a pity they didn&apos;t pad it with a bit more action connected to the main plot as what we got there was exciting and well-choreographed; the fights had an impressively physical feel to them. There are of course plenty of clichés but that goes with the genre. Jessica Chastain gives an impressive performance as Ava and John Malkovich and Colin Farrell are solid as Duke and antagonist Simon respectively. Geena Davis is fun as Ava&apos;s mother, although her presence made me think of her lead in &apos;The Long Kiss Goodnight&apos;; a superior female lead action film. Overall it passes the time well enough if you are a fan of the genre but is hardly a must see.",

      "reviewBody": "Having been one of the shows that was part of my childhood and growing up, the original &apos;Star Trek&apos; still holds up as great and ground-breaking, even if not perfect.\n\nThe fifth film of the franchise, &apos;The Final Frontier&apos;, is often considered the worst of the films, and one can understand why. To me, it is nowhere near as bad as its reputation, and feel in some way that the film was doomed even before it was released. Whether it is the worst overall &apos;Star Trek&apos; film is up for debate, it&apos;s a worthy contender. Is it the worst of the films based of the original series? Yes.\n\nIt is not a bad film by all means. The cinematography is neat and very nicely done in the quieter scenes, and William Shatner&apos;s direction works well in these moments.\n\nJerry Goldsmith&apos;s score is awesome personified, there is no bias intended as Goldsmith has always been one of my favourite composers, but the score here really rouses the spirits while touching the heart also.\n\n&apos;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&apos; does have some good scenes, namely the camping fire scene, the inner/greater pain scene (very intense and moving) and Scotty knocking himself out (the one bit of humour that works).\n\nThe chemistry between Kirk, Spock and McCoy is the film&apos;s driving force, and the interaction and interplay between them is the asset that comes off strongest.\n\nA few of the performances are good. Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley are very good, and Laurence Luckinbill does very well with what he&apos;s given, a villain that&apos;s both menacing and sympathetic. The rest of the crew mostly are very competently played.\n\nUnfortunately, they are underused and what they are given falls flat completely mostly, turning them into cartoonish parodies. The erotic dance was completely out of place and the getting lost stuff feels like filler to pad out a story that doesn&apos;t have an awful lot to it. Plus we have the most embarrassing rendition of &quot;Row, Row, Row Your Boat&quot; you&apos;ll find anywhere.\n\nGenerally the humour is as flat as a pancake, really overdone and juvenile. &apos;The Voyage Home&apos; had humour too but it was actually entertaining and even when poking fun felt more like &apos;Star Trek&apos;. Shatner&apos;s direction is incredibly chaotic in the action scenes, which sees production values that look unforgivably cheap even for the budget, with haphazard cinematography and editing and the worst of the uniformly shockingly shoddy special effects.\n\nJust for the record, as much as people would say that Shatner&apos;s ego has a lot to do with the problematic nature of the film (and yes having him trying to take on more than he could chew was excessive and most likely was not going to work from the start), the failure is much more at the door of budget limitations and studio interference, Shatner&apos;s original vision would have made for a much better and actually a fascinating film.\n\nOn top of that, &apos;The Final Frontier&apos; is filled with overripe dialogue with too much emphasis on the humour, which as said doesn&apos;t work, and less on heartfelt moments and thought-provoking conflicts. While there are a few good performances, the supporting cast are too underused to shine properly and Shatner&apos;s performance has more ham than the world&apos;s biggest pig farm.\n\nA big failure here is the story, which is dull and takes too long to get going with a plot too thin to sustain the running time. The whole stuff about god just confused the story and that for Sybok was a thrown in and unnecessary plot device done to presumably give more development to a character who was actually interesting and well developed already. The ending is convoluted and anti-climactic.\n\nOverall, hugely problematic but not without obvious merits. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

I guess Scarlett Johansson haters won&apos;t like the movie from the start, but everyone else can give it a shot.\n\nYes it is predictable, yes it has it&apos;s awkward moments, but it&apos;s also likable. The cast is stellar throughout, most of the jokes work and the kid performer walks a fine line, but always stays/plays it straight. The movie keeps a light tone overall, but has it&apos;s dark(er) moments too. They might not work for everyone (and some might hate the ending), but overall it&apos;s a decent movie (effort)",

      "reviewBody": "We have a new auteur in comedy director/writer Jody Hill. With two films and one television series under his belt now, his vision is pretty clear: he makes comedies about nasty, mean-spirited people who can be extremely unpleasant to be around. His work divide audiences sharply, and even those who like it, like myself, have their reservations. Observe and Report is heavily influenced by Taxi Driver. Seth Rogen plays the head of mall security. He spends most of his days wishing he were more important, but he also likes to believe that he is very important where he is. He dreams of shooting the bad guys and getting the hot girl (Anna Faris, a bimbo who works at a makeup counter at the mall). When a local police detective (Ray Liotta) starts horning in on his mall and his girl, Rogen begins to fly off the handle. Like Hill&apos;s previous film, The Foot Fist Way, what Observe and Report really needs is a few more laughs. It was funny, but it always felt like it could be funnier. The movie&apos;s often very depressing, and Hill is effective in making those painful moments work. Even though Rogen is pretty crazy and frankly a bad person, I felt sorry for him. If Hill could pull off more humorous moments, the balance would work a lot better.",

I was going to rate it as an 8, but I have to give it a 9 because I can&apos;t think of anything about it to criticise.\n\nThe plot is rather simple. Frank is a confused older man who is finding it difficult to take care of himself. He is given a robot medical assistant who is programmed to do only one thing: help Frank. Frank resists mightily at first, but soon Frank improves remarkably and takes up his earlier vocation: stealing jewels. It turns out that the robot&apos;s programming does not extend to obeying the law...\n\nThis film is interesting, surprising, heart-warming, intelligent, thought-provoking, amusing, understated, well written and well directed. It delivers first-rate performances by first-rate actors.\n\nIt defies categorisation. Is it science fiction? A heist movie? A family drama? A melancholic feel-good story about aging? It has no shootouts, no car chases, no superspies, no superheros, no martial arts scenes, no demented villains. What it does have is character development, good writing and a nice story.\n\nKudos to Schreier, Ford, Langella and Sarandon.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. I can sit in a theater and watch a mediocre movie, but when it comes time to write about it, there is no motivation or appeal. The most positive comment I can make is that it stars two very pretty men.\n\nThis one has &quot;paycheck project&quot; written all over it. Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake simply go through the motions as if someone is feeding them their lines through an ear piece. Gemma Arterton should never stoop to such a mundane and lifeless role ... though her hair and make-up are terrific. Only John Heard and Anthony Mackie come across as professional actors, and their minor roles are so limited, they barely register.\n\nWriting partners Brian Koppelman and David Levien co-wrote the excellent Rounders, but this one merely teases the dark underbelly of online gambling. It has neither the depth, plot or character development that we would expect from a movie with this premise and cast. Director Brad Furman showed promise with The Lincoln Lawyer, but this one comes across as being rushed through production with faux-style.\n\nThe closest comparison I can come up with is last year&apos;s Savages, directed by Oliver Stone ... and even that one was more enjoyable. Rather than a MPAA warning for Language, I would prefer a heads-up whenever the filmmaking team really doesn&apos;t care much for the project. At least I could spend my money and time watching a different movie.",

I actually got quite annoyed watching this. The computer action looked authentic by using existing OS-es and interfaces but they still made huge mistakes. IP&apos;s with numbers higher than 255 is just plain stupid and accessing a top-secret NSA program with some simple social engineering looked convincing on screen but I doubt the NSA allows simple user/pass access to such tooling. I could go on and on...\n\nI did like the idea of the plot, too bad the execution was so terrible. Probably the only thing I really liked where the two big shootout scenes, you saw a bit of Heat&apos;s director Mann there:)\n\nUnsynced audio and weird changes in volume where also very annoying, something you don&apos;t expect from a $70mil movie.\n\nI&apos;m giving this a +1 because it tried to be authentic so a 4 bumps up to a 5/10 rating.",

The controversy all stemmed around the film&apos;s last 30 minutes or so, when Jesus imagines what it would be like to skip out on the crucifixion scene and live the life of a normal man. I don&apos;t know what everyone got so hot and bothered about -- though I&apos;m no Bible expert, wasn&apos;t the whole point of Christ&apos;s story that he suffered the same pains and was tempted by the same sins as mankind so that his sacrifice meant something? \n\nWell, whatever. As a movie, &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; is pretty good, and yet further evidence that though Scorsese is known for gangster movies, he&apos;s a quite versatile director. It&apos;s probably a little too long, and a tad sluggish, but it&apos;s well acted and directed, and well worth watching, whether you&apos;re religious or not.\n\nGrade: A-",

But the chemistry between her and the lead isn&apos;t really the best. It&apos;s also not the best walk on a line between comedy and romance. But still that could be called nitpicking. And why would you want to do that, if you can just sit back and enjoy this as a boyfriend/girlfriend movie experience, instead of thinking too much about it? \n\nI think I might have overlooked a few flaws, just because of the likability of Kristen and the charm of most of the cast.",

      "reviewBody": "Super Mario Bros. (1993), was another case of the source material, for a film idea, being too advanced for the cinematic technology of the day. CGI was just starting with Jurassic Park (1993), so the choice to do this film with practical, physical effects and live action characters was its major downfall. This prompted the story to be adjusted to fit the capabilities of the filmmakers of the day. It all culminates into a silly plot, that actually manages to make video game characters, caricatures of themselves. This however, isn&apos;t a knock on the special effects used in this film at all. The effects fit the pre-CGI era fairly well. They did a very good job with the special effects, art direction, set design and most of the costumes and make-up. There actually is a dinosaur in the film and the computer effects used for him are pretty good. For 1993, it is visually pleasant.\n\nDennis Hopper, as President Koopa (Bowser), looks ridiculous though. There also is this weird use of the fungus in the film. It looks bad technically and isn&apos;t menacing at all. Many of the characters are pail, empty and mindless, especially Samantha Mathis as Princess Daisy. It doesn&apos;t translate well, especially having to depict Mario (Bob Hoskins) and Luigi (John Leguizamo), running around Brooklyn. The attempt to make the film as real as possible backfires. I never got a chance to see this film when it was first released, but I had heard of the negative fallout that came after it was released. I remember when Siskel and Ebert gave it two thumbs down. Most film-buffs remember hearing, that Bob Hoskins hated the movie. This is probably why I never got around to seeing Super Mario Bros. (1993), until the 2023 film was announced. 30 years later I finally understood. This film is a failure, but I still recommend seeing it, at least once, as a curiosity, because you have to see it to believe it.\n\n3.9 (F+ MyGrade) = 4 IMDB.",

      "reviewBody": "City Slickers entertained me enormously when I was a teenager because it has some good, solid laughs. Nowadays, as I approach my thirtieth birthday with frightening momentum, it still entertains me but it touches me too. That&apos;s probably what makes it such a great film: the skillful intertwining of humour, emotion and action.\n\n New Yorker Mitch (Billy Crystal) has reached crisis point in his mundane life. Bored by his job in the lower reaches of radio broadcasting and frustrated by the alarming rate at which years seem to be passing him by, he senses that his life has been a failure. His two friends, Phil (Daniel Stern) and Ed (Bruno Kirby) buy him a two week vacation for his birthday. No ordinary vacation, mind... a fortnight driving cattle across the Wild West, just like in the good old days. And it is while on this extraordinary vacation that the three buddies learn how to make the most of their mixed-up lives.\n\n The performances are uniformly excellent, especially Crystal who is in sharper form than ever before (or since, come to think of it) and Jack Palance as the leathery trail boss whose simple philosophies are surprisingly insightful. The scripting is outstanding, giving all the stars a chance to do some good character development, while providing terrific laugh-out-loud moments too. The film works on other levels too: the music is stirring, the photography spectacular and the editting very sharp (especially in a superb scene in which Crystal tries on an assortment of ill-fitting cowboy hats, only to opt in the end for his trusty old baseball cap). City Slickers is great entertainment, and one of the truly timeless comedy masterpieces from its decade.",

It is, perhaps, the last good &quot;hacker&quot; film (well, 23 (1998) also comes to mind, but that isn&apos;t widely available in English).\n\nThe math is believable (Janek&apos;s lecture makes sense), as is the technology (except for the Hollywood-ish decryption displays -- but that&apos;s forgivable). The characters are among the most realistic in any of these movies (with the exception of Joey the lamer in Hackers (1995) -- most accurate character in a hacking movie I&apos;ve seen yet).  They&apos;re each composites of well-known people from the 80s security scene.  The techniques they use are the techniques of the business, especially in that era.\n\nNow that computers have become such a big thing, I don&apos;t think it would be possible for Hollywood to produce another movie like this.  Anything made now would have to be far more glamorous and unrealistic.\n\nWhat&apos;s this movie got, if you don&apos;t care about any of that stuff?  It&apos;s tremendously funny, cleverly written (every scene works overtime to say and do more than one thing), and beautifully shot and scored.  (The opening scene and transition is wonderful)  The acting is priceless. I&apos;ve never met someone who didn&apos;t love this film.  See it.",

These Mindhunters train in a multidisciplinary capacity , including highly demanding field training . They are stranded at an island where are finding various killings executed by a serial murderer . For seven elite profilers, finding a serial killer is a process of elimination. Their own. Have been killed one by one . Who&apos;s the killer?.\n\nIn the picture there are mysteries , frenetic action , tension , suspense and a little bit of gore when the murders happen . From start to finish the nonstop action is continued , it is fast moving and that&apos;s why it is entertaining enough . The film is a crossover amongst the investigations means of ¨CSI¨ , the ¨Seven¨ (David Fincher) thriller , the training risks of ¨The recruit¨ (Roger Donaldson) and the intrigue of ¨Identity¨ (James Mangold) . The motion picture is a stimulating whodunit where we are really intrigued in the twisted happenings from the presentation to final . The screenplay has a complex plot and the end has an extraordinary surprise . The Investigative Support Unit (&quot;Mindhunters&quot; is slang for the ISU) is the FBI&apos;s special force (similar to ¨Criminal minds¨ TV series team) , they&apos;re profilers that have assisted state and local police in cracking some of the United States&apos; most notorious serial murder cases . Mindhunters specialize in understanding and profiling the chemistry and mechanical workings of the brain in these serial criminals and have researched notorious series killers . The motion picture is only setting on two stages : the FBI academy and the island ; however , it doesn&apos;t make boring , neither tired , nor dull , but amusing . The pic was professionally directed by Renny Harlin . The yarn will appeal to suspense and dark atmosphere fans . Rating : 6.5/10, good . Well worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "The third sequel in the long-running series is set firmly in the world of the late 1980s: we&apos;re talking lame fashions, big hair, rubbery special effects and a rather uneven tone veering midway between comedy and horror. It&apos;s all about what&apos;s over the top, with everybody involved aiming to outdo the scares and FX of the previous movies, but in the end none of this can disguise the fact that by this stage the story was wearing very thin. This is nothing more than a supernatural slasher that virtually reprises the plot of the first three films in the series with different characters.\n\nOf course, watching Robert Englund hamming it up will always be a guilty pleasure, and I have to say that the special effects are also pretty impressive. In the days before CGI, the FX team here went all out in creating bizarre and inventive death scenes, most notably a moment involving a giant cockroach. Freddy&apos;s resurrection at the outset is gratuitously silly yet somehow still works, paying homage to the old Chris Lee/Dracula resurrections in spectacular fashion. There are lots of able technicians working hard behind the scenes, including Howard Berger and Screaming Mad George, and in a film this reliant on special effects their diligence pays off.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to review this title objectively, because watching it makes me nostalgic for &apos;80s cinema in all its tacky badness. But I think it&apos;s fair to say that this is one of the better sequels out there; it&apos;s not frightening in the least, but it is entertaining and it&apos;s one of few enjoyable Renny Harlin-directed movies in existence, along with DIE HARD 2 and DEEP BLUE SEA.",

Actually, all three of the stars were ideal, but Ford and Weaver seemed to be supporting Griffith. She just seemed to embody that empowered career woman who sheds her mousy constraints.\n\nAnd it is a romantic comedy, but a subtle one. The humor is expressed in the dialogue and I found myself laughing more than I&apos;d expected. It&apos;s an &apos;80s movie down to its very DNA and pretty much everything about it still holds up.\n\n7/10",

I&apos;ll start with the animation and visualization in this anime, it&apos;s better than &quot;your name&quot;, and it captures the metropolitan culture of tokyo&apos;s Japanese people very well, though i miss the depiction of japan traditional culture and rural area in this movie. About the music, they have similar aura with &quot;your name&quot;, moving moments in the movie are captured brilliantly with the music. Storywise though, &quot;your name&quot; was a better love story than this movie, and &quot;your name&quot; made more sense than this movie. It is still a very good movie though, but I think it won&apos;t top &quot;your name&quot; success.. I hope shinkai will make many more good movie after this, and with this much of quality, I think many people would still want to watch his future projects.. I know I would.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw the world premiere of &quot;Bernie&quot; last night at the Los Angeles Film Festival. I must confess, after Jack Black&apos;s run of &quot;Year One&quot;, &quot;Gulliver&apos;s Travels&quot;, and &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, I was starting to lose hope of ever seeing the &quot;School of Rock&quot; guy I fell in love with. When I heard Richard Linklater (School of Rock) and Jack Black were teaming up again, I felt a glimmer of hope. I am happy to report, I was not disappointed last night! Jack Black gives one of the best performances of his career in &quot;Bernie.&quot; Shirley MacLaine was the icing on the cake and Matthew McConaughey was the cherry on top. I loved this movie! &quot;Bernie&quot; is based on the true story of Bernie Tiede, an assistant funeral director and general do-gooder, who confessed to killing Marjorie Nugent, a very rich and mean old lady. Bernie was a bit eccentric but beloved by his entire community of Carthage, Texas. Jack Black nails this performance. He really shows us what he is capable of as an actor. It was such a pleasure to watch him transform into Bernie Tiede. Great moments of physical comedy and also some twisted, dark moments of catching a glimpse into Bernie&apos;s spiraling psyche. Shirley MacLaine was Marjorie Nugent who was known as a mean, bitter lady with no friends and a family who tried to sue her for her money. You can&apos;t go wrong with Shirley MacLaine – she&apos;s just brilliant. The chemistry between MacLaine and Black was fantastic. I truly enjoyed watching them on the screen together. Even at the world premiere last night they had great chemistry in person. It seems like they truly loved working together on this film. Matthew McConaughey was great as the D.A. Danny Buck Davidson, the character didn&apos;t seem to be a huge stretch for him, but who cares – he was great! I&apos;m not sure when it is due to be released, but I will be recommending it to my friends when it hits theatres.",

They find help from Miami police detective Maya Cruz (Olivia Munn). AJ is involved with villainous Antonio Pope (Benjamin Bratt).\n\nAfter the original, I thought the sequel has a chance. I thought the guys&apos; chemistry would make a good buddy cop comedy if they can turn friends. They&apos;re still not that friendly but I&apos;m still going to say I&apos;m wrong. Kevin is doing the same thing and it&apos;s getting tiresome. Maybe the repetition is getting to me. It&apos;s actually getting a little annoying. He may be losing me at this point. It&apos;s time he consider something different.",

      "reviewBody": "Okay it&apos;s not exactly the biggest stretch of casting to have Robin Williams playing a ten year old in the body of an adult. However, Jack is a pretty decent and funny movie. Jack Powell is born and he ages at four times the normal rate. For the first ten years of his life he is tutored at home and sheltered by his parents. Bill Cosby plays his tutor Mr. Woodruff. Diane Lane and Brian Kerwin play his parents who are reluctant to send Jack to public school because they fear the other children&apos;s reactions to him. When he does go to school, his teacher, played by Jennifer Lopez, welcomes him with open arms while, predictably the kids are both awed and afraid, and teasing soon follows. Jack gains acceptance when the boys realize that he is a natural for basketball, and he soon is running with a whole group of new friends.\n\nThe rest of the movie is basically about Jack and how his body is just naturally slowing down, leading to his withdrawal from school, his eventual return, and the epilogue at his high school graduation.\n\nJack was a pretty charming film and I liked the way that Robin Williams acted in his scenes with Diane Lane as the 10 year old with a strong bond with his mother, and her feelings of longing when he shows that he is pulling away when he gains friends his own physical age.",

      "reviewBody": "What was once startling and shocking is now more humorous than anything else. This early Cronenberg film delivers his usual brand, but it doesn&apos;t stand the test of time. Between the infamous early head scene and the big confrontation ending scene, there is a lot of boredom, though some of it is okay. Some of the cast is a problem as well. Stephen Lack lacks talent and the more famous Jennifer O&apos;Neill isn&apos;t much better and ludicrously looks like she stepped away from a magazine cover shoot. On the other hand, Patrick McGoohan overacts. I saw this when released and this was the first time I had seen Michael Ironside. He&apos;s rather effective here in a creep role that he would often repeat in his, thus far, whopping 282 credits listed here. The only other performers of interest here are Lawrence Dane &amp; Robert A. Silverman in a small role. The special effects (all gore) hold up pretty well and for the uninitiated, this is a must for horror buffs.",

      "name": "Engaging and thoughtful Pedro Almodovar drama with biographic elements, being well played by Antonio Banderas",
      "reviewBody": "It deals with an aging director called Salvador Mallo in the twilight if his long career : Antonio Banderas/Pedro Almodovar , suffering chronical illness . The mature Salvador has seeen better days and he self-medicates between his continuous depression . Along the way , he reminds his mother : Penelope Cruz , his absent father : Raúl Arevalo , his sweet childhood in a village , his first crush on an adolescent , their home at a cave , the search for cinematic hits and happiness and several others incidents .\n\nTypical Almodovar film with biographic remarks concerning a filmmaker , Almodovar alter-ego, who suffers ordinary pain and a mental blockade who impedes to write and shot movies . These incoveniences reflect on his life , as he reminds his past life , loves , shooting and finds old friends and a previous lover . At last , he has a reborn , and a creative salvation outbursts in the way of a self-biographic storyline . The plot happens between these two subplots , his childhood along with his mom : Peneope Cruz/Julieta Serrano and the longest : adulthood period in which Banderas/Almodovar has relations with other roles as Nora Navas playing his friend/helper , the stage actor played Asier Etxeandia , an ex-lover performed by Leonardo Sbaraglia , and a doctor interpreted by Pedro Casablanc. The magnificent cast give very good interpretations , Antonio Banderas is sensational imitating gestures , grimace and visage of Pedro Almodovar himself. And other actors as Etxeandia , Julieta Serrano as the aging mother , Cecilia Roth, Susi Sanchez , Cesar Vicente , Julian López , all of them deliver nice acting . And brief appearance by the great musical star Rosalía. Special mention for the colorful and evocative cinematography by Jose Luis Alcaine, Almodovar&apos;s regular . Being filmed on location in Paterna, Valencia, Aranjuez and Madrid . It contains adequate but sad musical score by Alberto Iglesias who has composed several soundtracks in Almodovar films . And , of course , adding Chavela Vargas&apos; songs .\n\nThe motion picture was well directed by Pedro Almodovar in his usual style , being produced by his brother Agustín who appears in a cameo, as usual, and financed by their Production Company &quot; El Deseo&quot; . Being nominated for 2 Acaddemy Awards , another 68 wins and 161 nominations . This new Almodovar realization got success enough at boxoffice . Almodovar is deemed to be one of the best Spanish filmmakers. He has got a lot of hits with his dramas , such as : &quot; Talk to her&quot; , &quot;Volver&quot; , &quot;The Flower of my Secret&quot;, &quot;The Sin I live in&quot; , &quot;Abrazos Rotos&quot; , &quot;Carne Trémula&quot; , &quot;Tacones Lejanos&quot;, &quot;Matador&quot; , &quot;Que he hecho para merecer esto&quot; . But Almodovar also has made comedies as &quot; Women on the Edge of Breakdown&quot;, &quot;Kika&quot; , &quot;I am so excited&quot; and &quot;Pepi, Lucía and Boom&quot; , among others . Rating 6.5/ 10. The picture will appeal to Pedro Almodovar enthusiasts .",

Halloween can be scary without having Michael Myers. I dare say that this movie is better than the original (which I didn&apos;t really like) because it&apos;s original and includes millions of people dying, not the few people in a house like in the other &quot;Halloween&quot; movies.\n\nDeaths were pretty cool and scary. That rich family getting killed in a few seconds and the misfire death was pretty unexpected. The driller death was also very disturbing.\n\nThe only thing that I didn&apos;t like at all, was the use of excessive science fiction. It was like watching a Terminator or Alien movie or something. The killer masks are one thing, but the robot guards and Stonehenge shooting some sort of laser is a bit too much.\n\nStill worth watching though. If you want to watch good Halloween movies, just watch this, the first two and H20, don&apos;t bother with the rest cause they&apos;re all awful. 7/10"

Eddie Murphy has a change of pace then the usual goofy character, but he has extremist views and in todays world it&apos;s plainly fine, if he had different colour skin I doubt it would have the same comedic affect. The film is about two different cultures coming together, however it&apos;s so obsessed with race issues it&apos;s seems to create more of a divide then a sense of coming together as one, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve watched a film where they compare black and white people so much, it did have some good laughs however and can be enjoyable for some.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;You ever feel like your waiting for forever to find out what your destiny is and when you do it&apos;s not really that exciting?&quot; After receiving a phone call from a wrong number Jeff (Segel) thinks that the call has a deeper reason. His mom (Sarandon) calls and asks him to run an errand for him. What starts as a simple trip to a hardware store begins to evolve and change the lives of everyone Jeff comes into contact with, including his brother Pat (Helms). This is another movie that is almost nothing like the preview. The preview made it seem much funnier then it was. While this did have some funny parts in it I found this movie to be more sweet and heartfelt then I expected. Some of the aspects of the movie are very serious but they are done in a way that tone it down. Segel is just about the perfect choice for this role because there is just something about him that you find disarming and comfortable no matter what he is doing. If you are looking for a typical Segel comedy this is not it. This one has more substance and heart and is very much worth watching. Overall, if you liked &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; then this movie is for you. I recommend this but this is again not your average comedy. I give it a B+.",

The Molly Ringwald styling was perfect, but again, would be lost on someone who didn&apos;t have their teenage years filled with John Hughes films.\n\nI liked the soundtrack, clothes, makeup, and hair that looked just like the 1980s.\n\nKiernan did a great job as Jamie.

The priest personifies the world&apos;s intense conflicts between the unstoppable forces of destruction (our planet, our relationships, the consequences of the Iraq war, the brutality of corporate polluters, slavery, churches more attuned to materialism than spirituality) and the receding forces of gentleness, compassion, prayers. This isn&apos;t a religious movie, though profoundly spiritual. It reminded me of Dostoyevsky, Camus and the anguish of existing in a universe so corrupted that even the thought of bringing a child seems like a sin to his father. Both Ethan Hawke and Amanda Seyfried are amazing to watch. And my admiration to Paul Schrader..",

      "reviewBody": "Victoria, I am sad to say, is largely overrated despite the truly mesmerising cinematography. Since the incredible one-take film became widely known, most of the critical consensus agrees that is a fantastic film. I found it only decent. Whilst there are moments of genuine breathless tension, the crime elements are superb, and the ending is good, it seems too often like it is trying to be - and I am loath to use this word - &apos;artsy&apos;. The script was apparently only 12 pages long (that&apos;s about 11 minutes of film per script page) which means almost all of the dialogue is improvised. Which is neat, but does not make for compelling viewing, as the characters apart from the titular protagonist (another positive would be Laia Costa&apos;s stupendous performance) just don&apos;t have enough depth to be interesting. Were it not for the unique cinematographic excellence this would be nothing more than an average thriller with some decent moments that tried too hard to rise above its station.\n\nBut talking of the cinematography...take a bow Sturla Brandth Grøvlen, you magnificent genius. This bests all the works of Emmanuel Lubezki and Roger Deakins, and is simply the best feat of cinematography I&apos;ve ever seen. Flawlessly transitioning from building to street to car to club to the intensity of a foot race and shoot out, all with the precision and careful craftsmanship of any great film. In fact, after only 15 minutes you&apos;re barely noticing it any more. After a while, you may realise that you&apos;ve literally followed these characters all the way from that club and the mind boggles. It&apos;s arguably worth watching just to witness this spectacular achievement - you&apos;ll most likely find an entrancing and ambitious effort that has a film tacked on to it with ideas a little above its station and a tendency to be too showy at times. 62/100",

Check out how many jokes are about acting, about every third one.\n\nAnd then check out what they did next, with &quot;Scary Movies,&quot; which takes the circle one more loop.\n\nI admit that I&apos;m a fan. They seem to be the only ones who can do what Zucker used to: serve up what are generally called spoofs.\n\nI think it is because they start knowing that the target isn&apos;t bits of movies, but the bits we use in inventing the stories of who we are.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

      "reviewBody": "I like it when I do know know how to feel! Herzog seems to start out by portraying a man, Timothy Treadwell, as a crazy, self-obsessed (NOT Grizzly-obsessed) individual who gets himself and his girlfriend killed for no purpose, in the Alaskan wilderness. Initially I thought that the story was a cross between &apos;Jackass&apos; and the Discovery Channel - you have a dopey, though he only sounds like it, blonde surfer type who likes to approach (awfully close) and make sweet-talk with 10-foot bears. Viewers might see Timothy as a reckless, selfish misfit, but as the film continues, your appreciation for his cause deepens - but what is his cause? Is it to work out personal demons? Absolutely. Treadwell clearly has mental/emotional problems, just listen to how many times he tells the wild animals &quot;I love you!&quot; or when he talks about his lack of success with &quot;human women.&quot; But his passion for the grizzlies and their wilderness is real. Herzog particularly commends him as a filmmaker, seizing unique opportunities and rendering priceless footage. Do not forget that TT lived close to the bears for 13 years (including the year he was killed) without harm; and that his success, his careful, intuitive, loving behavior was only partly self-aggrandizing.",

Debra Winger and Louis Gossett are also outstanding.  It is a movie that you either love or you hate and, over the years, the critics have very much wanted to play it down but there is no doubt in my mind that it is a classic tale well told with every aspect of &quot;the cinema&quot; used to its fullest extent"

      "reviewBody": "The executive Bob Munro (Robin Williams) is stressed, feeling threatened of losing his job and his lifestyle, since his abusive boss Todd Mallory (Will Arnett) hired the Stanford&apos;s geek Laird (Richard Cox) to work in their soda&apos;s company. Bob has promised his wife Jamie Munro (Cheryl Hines), his teenage daughter Cassie Munro (Joanna &apos;JoJo&apos; Levesque) and his young son Carl Munro (Josh Hutcherson) to spend vacations in Hawaii, but Todd demands him to prepare a presentation and attend a business meeting with the owners of a family company in a merging operation scheduled in the same period. Bob hides the truth to his family, rents a recreational vehicle and tries to convince his dysfunctional family that a road trip to the Colorado Rocky Mountains would be good to bring old values back to their family. After many incidents and while in the trailers parking area, the rookie Bob is helped by the bizarre but friendly Gornicke family. They escape from the Gornickes and initiate a journey of difficulties and leaning, retrieving their forgotten family bonds.\n\nWhen I decided to watch &quot;RV&quot; on DVD, I had lower expectations, but I am still laughing while writing my review. This hilarious movie has many unforgotten sequences, but my two favorites are in the very beginning, when Cassie promises to love her father forever, and when Bob complains that the family watches television in four different apparatuses and needs Internet to communicate among them. This family entertainment has good messages relative to family bonding, pressure in the job and true friends. There are some gross, but also funny scenes, and in the end I really liked this comedy. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Férias no Trailer&quot; (&quot;Vacations in the Trailer&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "The legion of female teenage fans who turn up in droves for this preview screening is probably testament to the drawing power of Zac Efron, probably Hollywood&apos;s latest heartthrob who&apos;s standing his ground with his alpha male status from the High School Musical series, to films like Hairspray and 17 Again where he plays a star basketballer who&apos;s life didn&apos;t turn out as he thinks. In Charlie St. Coud, a romance flick with its title named after his character (which tells a lot about his ability to marquee a film), he too plays a star sportsman (here it&apos;s sailing) whose championship potential got cut short by tragedy, which turned him into someone who can see and communicate with dead people.\n\nI kid you not if you think this was a Shaymalan picture, but it&apos;s more Disney friendly that you can imagine, with his powers only limited to communicating with spirits caught in limbo, and thus making him the town looney where it&apos;s best to leave him alone. His powers only came where he was pulled from the brink of death by a paramedic (Ray Liotta) some five years ago, where his babysitting of his young brother Sam (Charlie Tahan) turned out tragically in ways that&apos;s not his fault, because Zac Efon&apos;s the latest blue eyed boy of the industry, and his character cannot be all that negative (see uproar cause by 17 Again&apos;s premarital sex)\n\nFrom what would be the promise of sailing challenges and scholarships, Charlie becomes a cemetery caretaker in the same cemetery his brother got buried in, so as to be able to play catch with him every evening deep in the woods without fail, as his guilt made him succumb to not being able to let go and move on. To most he&apos;s a lost cause, that his second stab at life was wasted in doing something menial other than to change the world or something, but this doesn&apos;t bother Charlie so long as he gets to seek out his dead brother as a confidante.\n\nBut of course a romance movie will suggest to you that love will conquer all and set him free, and this comes in the form of Tess (Amanda Crew), his school mate admiring him from afar, sharing his same passion for sailing (not spook interacting) and is gearing up for the challenge of sailing solo around the world. Curious about Charlie and never hiding the fact that she&apos;s interested in him, they soon hook up, but there&apos;s more to this romantic angle that I will like to give it credit to as I didn&apos;t see it coming, feeling rather bored about the film until a spanner got thrown into its narrative to shake things up a little.\n\nThe one thing working against Charlie St. Cloud&apos;s favour is just how convenient things can turn out to be, especially in its final act involving shooting stars (told you it&apos;s far out) and stroke of lucks, but for fans of Efron these can all be overlooked so long as their hero gets plenty of screen time as a romantic lead spouting lines like never leaving you, and being together forever, anything that&apos;s swoon-worthy enough to appeal to his demographic fan base. It&apos;s not a perfect movie, but has enough to make it an above average date movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Likable Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) stumbles innocently into the role of a killer, guided along the way by his evil talking cat and benevolent talking dog.\n\nReading other reviews, you will find words like &quot;genre-bending&quot; or &quot;a mess&quot;, and indeed, the film is a bit uneven. The tone shifts a bit here and there, though it really is not all that bothersome and others seem to complain too loud.\n\nAlthough Gemma Arterton has been great in the past, she just does not make the character of Fiona even remotely likable. She is supposed to be the love interest of Jerry, but there is just nothing about her that suggests chemistry. Anna Kendrick, on the other hand, is excellent, and it is great to see that she has been maintaining a high profile after &quot;Up In The Air&quot;. She might have been the only actor to escape &quot;Twilight&quot; unscathed.\n\nReynolds should be praised for his range of voices (the cat sounds like Craig Ferguson and the dog sounds like Gary Busey). This could have been a weak point, but he instead elevates it to the next level. He also has the right personality to take a story that seems to combine the Son of Sam and &quot;Master and Margarita&quot; and make it fun.\n\nIf nothing else, there is a Chinese Elvis, and this may be the only movie able to claim that.",

I did find some parts were slow but overall I got some good laughs here and there. I&apos;ve watched Adam Sandler movies since Billy Madison came out in 1995. I believe this is the first movie with Adam Sandler and Julie Bowen since Happy Gilmore (1996) and I really enjoyed seeing them work together again after over 20 years. There are some Easter eggs hidden in this movie that connect some of Adams older movies, it was a nice stroll down memory lane when I noticed them, I don&apos;t wanna spoil them for you so see if you can spot them! If you&apos;re looking for an Oscar nominated picture possibility then this movie isn&apos;t for you. If you&apos;re looking for a movie that doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously and for you to have a nice Halloween laugh and mini scare here and there, then pop some popcorn and enjoy Hubie Halloween!

      "name": "Robert DeNiro&apos;s Acting is More than Fine...",
      "reviewBody": "Based on Guiseppe Tornatore&apos;s 1990 Italian film, Stanno tutti bene, writer/director Kirk Jones has brought some of the best work out of Robert DeNiro in decades. Everybody&apos;s Fine is a fascinating tale about Frank (DeNiro), a widower who wants to get his four adult children together for dinner, but when one by one they all cancel for good reasons or lack of a better word excuses, he decides against the advice of his doctor, to make a surprise trip to all their residences in New York, Chicago, Denver, and Las Vegas. What the trip brings him however, is a heavy realization that despite what his late-wife told him, maybe everybody&apos;s not fine.\n\nTreading heavy territory to resemble films like About Schmidt, Everybody&apos;s Fine is a heartfelt, emotional film that will leave you in tears. Though the narrative could come off a bit over-dramatic at times, there&apos;s no denying the warmth that the film conveys to family and loyalty. DeNiro is most effective in his role of Frank Goode, the hard-working father whose long hours putting up coating on telephone wire may have cost him more than he thought. Director, Kirk Jones makes some great artistic choices, especially in the final scenes of the film. One thing however that is surprising is how the film is being marketed. Portraying itself as a holiday-comedy is going to be quite unexpected to viewers as the film is weighty with emotion and less on the laughs. \n\nThe supporting players, in this case the adult children, are all beautifully cast. Drew Barrymore has never been sweeter in the role of Rosie, a dancer in Vegas with a &quot;Daddy&apos;s Girl&quot; mentality. Kate Beckinsale is stunning in looks and adequate in delivery as Amy, a top advertisement executive. Sam Rockwell, who is long overdue for Oscar attention, plays Robert, the musician who painfully seeks his father&apos;s approval. \n\nEnough can&apos;t be said about DeNiro who gives one of his finest performances of his career. Showing a softer side yet remaining in tuned with his fatherly instincts, DeNiro has redeemed some of his lesser works in the past years. He takes in some of the best and worst parts of all fathers&apos; across the world. Worrying yet too hard at times it spills over into his children&apos;s decisions. Where the narrative misses in some aspects, DeNiro makes up for with his devotion and commitment to the character. It&apos;s an outstanding turn for him in his late career.\n\nOver-dramatic, cliché, and a bit predictable, Everybody&apos;s Fine shows a beating heart. There&apos;s no stupidity or attitude in its form, just pure feeling. If you come from a family of secrets for the greater good (which may be the majority of us), this will speak volumes. \n\n***/****",

Its about the son of a scientist who is thrust upon him the quest of finding the Titan, the greatest ship ever built, and is humanity&apos;s last chance.\n\nThe movie begins with an awesome scene of the evacuation of earth, and caught me nicely off guard with some great 3D rendering of the Titan (when launched), and the escape ships. The imagination that went into some scenes in the movie, especially the cruising alongside the wake angels, and the ice rinks were fantastic. And the plot, though a bit unrealistic in terms of modern science, was thoroughly refreshing in concept. And its got just the right balance of action to move it quickly from a kids film to a good sci-fi show for slightly older audiences.\n\nTitan A.E is a great film. It has a story that&apos;s original and neatly executed. It brought about some great 3D rendering in a time where animation was primarily 2D. Its got good character development with a nice twist in the middle. And its also got a fine soundtrack, which I love to listen to.\n\nGo watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.",

      "name": "Classic Spongebob Returns",
      "reviewBody": "Spongebob Squarepants is one of the greatest animated television shows of all time. It sounds weird, but for some reason, it shaped the sense of humor of a generation and possibly one of the inspirations that helped exceed the imagination and creativity of many cartoon shows that came after. The show itself has been terrific in its first three seasons, but after its first feature film, it slowly loses its touch until every character becomes something else other than what they were once known for. This latest Spongebob film might be the end of its glory as it seemingly panders the audience into another lame Alvin and the Chipmunks/The Smurfs approach, but surprisingly that only becomes a marketing stunt, and it turns out that most of the movie is basically just like the show, but at its original form. It didn&apos;t need any grand or blockbuster type of plot to save the material, we just need to revisit the stuff that we truly loved about Spongebob.\n\nOther than its creative animation and zany undersea world, Spongebob Squarepants has always been known for its richly established characters and unique sense of humor. I haven&apos;t seen the show in a while, specifically the newer episodes, but I do remember how the ones that followed season four have become paler incarnations of the show. This feature film, while stuck in posing as a typical family movie fare, is actually meant to stay loyal to what really defines this show. The characters have gone back to their classic personalities (Spongebob can now be reasonable again than just a complete goofball) and the humor is smartly priceless in an ultimately unhinged way. The film doesn&apos;t offer anymore bigger plot than retrieving the Krabby Patty secret formula, it&apos;s all about fooling at the audiences as it messes with the logic and their senses, the Spongebob way, of course.\n\nThe mix of animation and live-action is definitely never a stranger to Spongebob, but its involvement is often taken as a joke. Here, it&apos;s supposed to be its central idea. Though, it takes so long for them to get out of the water, in spite of its title, but when they do, it still sticks to its own surreal, extremely ludicrous style. But their welcoming antics up there felt forced, in comparison. The 3D stuff really exists to attract the viewers who thinks it&apos;s gonna be a cute adventure with the characters as silly superheroes, but it&apos;s mostly just a small payoff to those who have that expectation. It kind of cheats them, otherwise it&apos;s a cool trick for instead luring them to what makes this material so enjoyable. But we don&apos;t have to underestimate this approach too much, because apparently it&apos;s still pretty fun when they are in the real world, giving the humans some hilarious reactions, like the one who&apos;s wondering if the Krabby Patty he&apos;s eating is hallucinogenic after encountering the gang as superheroes.\n\nAs feature film goes, it doesn&apos;t go beyond bombastic, if it does then it&apos;s all about the weirdness instead of epic proportions. This is basically just like a new episode on a length of an actual movie. And the cast has always been great no matter what. Out of all the cartoons Tom Kenny has been, Spongebob will always be his best and he once again brings the lovable charm to the character. While Antonio Banderas makes a fun turn as the villain, but his moments are the one where he interacts to talking seagulls which amazingly works for this character.\n\nThe Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is what the fans deserve. Not sure how the newcomers would exactly react to it, but this movie fully represents the true spirit of the show. It would be a brilliant surprise to the ones who missed this great side of Spongebob. It didn&apos;t need any deeper sentiments or darkness (unless we&apos;re referring to its twisted humor, because it gets a little close to that.) Sure it&apos;s not the best episode ever either, but it has so many elements that remind us why we loved this show in the first place. The out-of-water scenes weren&apos;t as bad as many fans were worried about, it&apos;s just some randomly crazy addition to an already fun ride. Overall, it&apos;s more nostalgic than groundbreaking, I do hope this movie would be the salvation of this show. It won&apos;t change anyone&apos;s life or anything, we just like Spongebob to be Spongebob again and that&apos;s already given too much to a fan like me who grew up with the cartoon.",

      "reviewBody": "As far as bizarre and uncomfortable art films go, Nicolas Winding Refn&apos;s Valhalla Rising is pretty tame. In fact, it is so comparatively tame that the film&apos;s marketers felt they could serve it up as an action-packed Viking film—a terrible decision that caused the film to be a horrendous flop; because after all, this is a bizarre and uncomfortable art film. When I say &quot;tame,&quot; of course, I do not mean it does not have an explicit evisceration scene—because it does—I mean it has a relatively discernible plot and characters with names.\n\nThe protagonist, One Eye (Mads Mikkelsen in a stark, fearsome performance), does not say a single word in the entire film. The other characters do a lousy job of filling in the silence, for I think I counted somewhere in the vicinity of twenty-four lines in total.\n\nIn addition to long periods of silence, the film also features clay-covered voodoo rock men, inverted dream sequences (I think), and a lot of existential symbolism—making it, without a doubt, a very bizarre and uncomfortable art film.\n\n(Disclaimer: The film features starkly beautiful cinematography and brilliant performances. Certainly worth watching)",

      "reviewBody": "It continually amazes me that Tom hanks will go down as one of the best dramatic actors of our generation and little will be spoken of how good a physical comedian he was before &quot;Philadelphia&quot; changed his career. Hanks made a string of movies in the 80s relying on his physical comedy ability, most notable &quot;Big&quot;, &quot;the burbs&quot;, &quot;dragnet&quot;, &quot;turner &amp; hooch&quot; etc. But I think that with the POSSIBLE exception of &quot;Big&quot; - &quot;The Money Pit&quot; is his best. Some of the scenes involving Hanks in this movie made me laugh so hard I couldn&apos;t breathe. This movie is intended to be a farce and it succeeds totally. The rest of the cast is not very strong - I have never, and I assume never will be, a Shelley Long fan - she doesn&apos;t do anything but provide a sounding board for Hanks anyway. But then again, she really doesn&apos;t need to. \n\nThis movie is definitely worth taking a look at if you haven&apos;t seen it - the first time you watch it, it is genuinely hilarious. I just watched it again after about three years without seeing it and found it to still  hold up. The scene when the chimney falls apart is my favorite. I wish hanks would do another comedy, but he&apos;s all serious now. oh well."

Buffalo 66 is one of the finest independent films that I have ever seen, and perhaps the most fascinating character study I have yet to see on film.\n\nChristina Ricci provides one of the year&apos;s best performances as Layla, the odd but tenderhearted tap dancer who provides Gallo&apos;s Billy Brown with the only true love he has ever received. Ricci&apos;s performance is brilliantly understated, and she relays just as much heartfelt meaning in one glance of her beautiful, dark eyes as Gallo does in his barrage of rapid-fire monologues.\n\nThere are also fine supporting performances from Ben Gazzara and Angjelica Huston, as Billy&apos;s utterly dysfunctional parents, Mickey Rourke, as a sleezy bookie, Jan-Michael Vincent, as Billy&apos;s touchingly loyal friend and owner of a bowling alley, and Kevin Corrigan, as Billy&apos;s slow but well-meaning best friend.\n\nBuffalo 66 is an incredibly moving and beautiful film. It provides some of the starkest movie images of blue-collar society to come along since the &apos;70s. The on-location Buffalo, New York sites are haunting in their bleakness, and the filtered photography emphasizes this all the more.\n\nOn top of all of this, Gallo provides a mesmerizing performance as Billy Brown-a man who has spent so much of his life pining for love and tenderness that he doesn&apos;t know how to deal with it once it is staring him in the face.\n\nSimply put, Buffalo 66 is a staggering achievement. Vincent Gallo is a fiercely talented filmmaker and a force to be reckoned with in the future."

The cute, girl next door role is traded for a mesmerising controlling role of Gangubai and she owns it. Excellent visual appeal, as you expect from a Sanjay Leela Bansali movie. The music is outstanding throughout. Dholida makes you fall in love with solo garba, and Alia&apos;s performance in that song is jaw dropping. Worth waiting for. Her final speech where she sits and delivers to an audience is Amtiabh Bachchan-esque. Ajay Devgan is brilliant albeit a cameo role. Worth a watch to see how well Alia delivers the Mafia Queen role!",

      "reviewBody": "In 1962, the world stood on the brink of World War III for &quot;Thirteen Days,&quot; a 2000 film starring Kevin Costner, Bruce Greenwood, Steven Culp and Dylan Baker, with direction by Roger Donaldson. The story concerns the &quot;Cuban Missile Crisis,&quot; when the U.S. discovered that the Soviets had placed missiles aimed at the U.S. in Cuba.\n\nAs someone who remembers the situation well, watching this was a profound experience in more ways than one. A good deal of dialogue was taken from actual Presidential transcripts, which made watching it even more impressive. Looking at it from today&apos;s eyes, &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; is a knockout.\n\nDonaldson focuses the film right where it should be - in the White House and in conference rooms, giving us only the subplot of Kenny O&apos;Donnell&apos;s family life. For those posters who commented that O&apos;Donnell was perhaps not a real person, yes, he was. It&apos;s impossible for me to believe that with a film that goes into so much detail and strove to be so factual, someone thought there was a made-up character. Try Google next time. Ken O&apos;Donnell headed up Kennedy&apos;s presidential campaign and was appointed his Special Assistant when Kennedy won the White House. He was the most powerful of the President&apos;s advisers.\n\nSeveral things become clear about the goings-on at the White House in 1962: None of the military leaders thought the Kennedy administration belonged in the White House; if it had been up to the military leaders, the situation would have caused World War III; JFK turned himself into a pretzel in order to pursue a diplomatic solution to the potential conflict. Though discouraged almost at every turn, JFK still would not allow the shooting to begin, pushing instead for an embargo against Cuba.\n\nThere is plenty of tension and excitement in this film. One of the best scenes is Commander Eckerd (Christopher Lawford) and his team low-flying over Cuba taking photos, and a U-2 pilot trying to avoid missiles chasing him. But most of the tension and excitement takes place in the meetings as the President and RFK struggle for answers and play for time. The mix is therefore ideal: drama, some aerial excitement, and a little humor as Adlai Stevenson gets the better of the Russians in an OAS meeting.\n\nThere&apos;s also a look at the reaction of the country - also very accurate. Yes, people piled into church, cleared the grocery shelves of everything, and stocked fallout shelters. We all watched the President on television. In fact, as he talked, my mother thought he was about to declare war. It was a terrifying time.\n\nKenny O&apos;Donnell&apos;s role in all of this may have been somewhat exaggerated to make it a palatable role for Kevin Costner. Costner does okay in the part. Boston accents are very difficult to do without them sounding put on. It&apos;s very difficult to do accents in general and make them organic to the character. A few have succeeded: Anne Bancroft in &quot;The Miracle Worker,&quot; Paul Newman in &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me,&quot; little Natalie Wood in &quot;Tomorrow is Forever,&quot; Travolta in &quot;Saturday Night Fever,&quot; and of course there are others. Jane Seymour and Joan Collins can easily pull off being Americans. All British actors can do a southern accent, since the southern accent started off as a British accent. Costner lays it on too thick and it&apos;s a distraction. But he certainly isn&apos;t bad in the role.\n\nThe casting people merely wanted to suggest JFK and RFK. In Steven Culp, they found a young actor with similar features to RFK. He does an effective job, given that it&apos;s tough going to portray such a famous person. The most successful in the film is Bruce Greenwood as JFK, who tries to keep the accent from overpowering the dialogue. In the President&apos;s television speech, I&apos;m sure he imitated JFK&apos;s every single inflection and pause, and it&apos;s perfect. His JFK is a listener, very dependent on his brother&apos;s advice, and one who takes the burdens of the country on his shoulders like a cross. One of the posters here mentioned something to the effect that &quot;we are led to believe that JFK leaned heavily on his advisors&quot; as if this is a negative. Of course he did. Of course any President does or should. The final decisions belonged to him, and he had to be sure of all of the ramifications. Only an idiot doesn&apos;t hear every single opinion of value before he decides to launch World War III.\n\nThe camaraderie between RFK, JFK, and O&apos;Donnell is as unmistakable as their arguments and frustrations.\n\nThirteen months after the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK would be dead and O&apos;Donnell would be riding behind him in the Secret Service Car. After a particularly tough meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, O&apos;Donnell insists that JFK sit for a minute, and JFK finally does. Worn out and not sleeping well, he laments about being President. &quot;I just thought there would be more good days.&quot; In the end, we - and he - would have settled for just MORE days.",

Thy visualization of the meetings in the web with other hackers are very good pictured.\n\nThe plot of who Am I is very complex. At the beginning it doesn&apos;t look so deep, but while it comes to conclusion the movie shows us his high-class.\n\nThe actors with a authentic Tom Schilling and the affected Elyas M&apos;Barek are also properly elected. The characters are very different, what creates varied dialogs. All in all Who am i is a must-see for all Germans and a very good movie for international thriller fans.",

We don&apos;t need to see a carriage load of soldiers cut down with machine guns in a choreographed ballet sequence, just the arcing laser sights through an open doorway. We don&apos;t need ultra evil bad guys who kill off their companions in sudden rages, just a compassionate man on a disillusioned mission for peace. We don&apos;t need the &apos;obligatory&apos; kiss between the co stars at the finale, just the promise of future things.\n\nPeacemaker is politically unbelievable, it has some seriously ill thought out moments. But at the end of the day it brings a freshness to sequences we&apos;ve all seen a million times before, it lets us feel the emotions of ALL the characters. Intelligent, stylish, and great fun to boot. Worth a couple of hours of anyone&apos;s evening.",

I have really enjoyed some of Steve&apos;s movies...&quot;Roxanne&quot;, &quot;Being There&quot;, etc. but he seems to have lost his touch in this one.\n\nThis movie is still very watchable mind you, but the &quot;former&quot; Steve is missing. It seems there were too many gags (ie; dog &amp; crotch, dangling from balcony) and not enough real comedy like we&apos;re used to from Steve (such as the nose jokes in Roxanne).\n\nAlso this movie has nothing to do with the 1950 &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (or it&apos;s original sequel &quot;Belles on Their Toes&quot;)...other than 12 kids of course. It seemed more akin to &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot; or &quot;Meatballs&quot;.\n\nThere were some cute scenes however: The two kids crush &amp; the dads both spying on them in the theatre, and nearly giving birth in a canoe I found amusing. It would have been a lot more amusing had she actually given birth in the canoe though.\n\nOddly my favourite actress in this was the little girl (can&apos;t remember her name right now) who had the crush on the little boy. She was really cute and engaging. I hope she appears in more movies.\n\nThankfully, I did not pay money to see this (thanks to the wonders of bittorrent) But I will definitely be buying the DVD. It is a good family movie, just not up to my expectations for Steve Martin.\n\nPossibly I should not endorse downloading, but movie-going is difficult where I live as it entails a long, costly ferry trip. Otherwise I probably would have seen this in a theatre.",

I have been to Marshall in my travels over most of the highways in Texas, I know about Paul Quinn College and Prairie View A &amp; M University. This wasn&apos;t even about my Daddy&apos;s Texas, as he was just a small boy at the time. It was, however, my Grandfather&apos;s Texas. he typified the characters in this film.\n\nWith Denzel Washington directing and acting, I expected an outstanding film. I was not prepared to be so emotionally taken in that I left the theater wiping tears from eyes. This was a powerful statement about the differences in American. Differences that were typified by Franklin Roosevelt&apos;s affirmative action program for whites - the New Deal; differences that would be repeated twenty years later after WWII when the whites again received affirmative action in the form of the GI Bill. Robert Eisele&apos;s story really brought home the pain and deprivation of being Black in America, and how some could overcome that deprivation with the right help, but could never overcome the pain.\n\nBesides Washington, there were outstanding performances by Forest Whitaker, Nate Parker, Jurnee Smollett, and Denzel Whitaker, as a 14-year-old in college.\n\nTears in my eyes, I will long remember this film as one of the best of the year and of many years.",

      "reviewBody": "The first SINISTER was a fairly scary &amp; very atmospheric Horror film but this sequel definitely wasn&apos;t scary in the slightest because it felt like a Children of the Corn flick &amp; a family drama mixed together.\n\nJames Ransone is very good again as the timid &amp; scared Duputy from the first film &amp; James is a very interesting actor &amp; is a very good actor &amp; i liked him more than Ethan Hawke in the first film. James was excellent in the brilliant &quot;IT: Chapter 2&quot; &amp; is genuinely a good actor who i like to see. Ransone definitely is the best thing about this sequel. His Deputy is a funny character with a good heart &amp; is now a private investigator working on the case of the Evil Supernatural Deaths after the horrific murders of the Oswalds family.\n\nThe Deputy meets a scared mother with her two weird sons that are on the run &amp; hiding out in a big old farm house next to an abandoned church that was the site for a families murder. The story is fine really &amp; the cast is decent with the super sexy Shannyn Sossamon as the boys weary mum with her own problems going with her abusive ex-husband &amp; now Supernatural goings on at her farm house. The weird skinny young boys are the target of a bunch of evil ghost kids that wanna persuade them to kill their family but one boy is good &amp; one is bad.\n\nThis does feel very routine for a Supernatural flick &amp; nothing stands out as scary, unique or even creepy at all. In fact SINISTER 2 felt like a Goosebumps episode or something similar. The fact you see the ghostly kids constantly &amp; the boys sit talking to them regularly that there is zero threat at all &amp; no tension or fear for the audience but it&apos;s still a fun &amp; entertaining supernatural film. Of course Sinister 2 was totally inspired by Stephen Kings Children of the Corn &amp; that&apos;s fine. I did like the rural setting with the big old farm house &amp; the corn fields.\n\nThe film is watchable &amp; fun but that&apos;s completely down to James Ransone keeping it all interesting &amp; fun because he&apos;s a good actor &amp; Deputy is a good character full of awkward charm.\n\nThe first Sinister was definitely more creepy &amp; atmospheric but i will say that Sinister 2 is much more fun &amp; i love that Duputy character.",

      "reviewBody": "The talanted horror/thriller director Jim Mickle (Cold in July; Stake Land) teams up with the rising star Boyd Holbrook &amp; brings to Netflix his newest piece - the exciting and entertaining mystery detective/killer flick &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot;.\n\n&quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot; starts like any other police thriller, introducing us to a duo of likeable cops, a damp city full of crime &amp; a mystery in the making. Through equal amounts of engaging drama, energetic action and time skipping we steadily move forward to the solution of the mystery, accompanied by the obsessive detective Lockhart who&apos;s got some heavy burdens on his shoulders. Boyd Holbrook, whom I first saw on &quot;Narcos&quot; (as I&apos;m sure many people did as well) gives a great lead performance as detective Lockhart &amp; the supporting cast helps him out well, especially Bokeem Woodbine &amp; Cleopatra Coleman. The revelation of the sci-fi twist &amp; the point of the mystery comes a tad bit too slowly &amp; doesn&apos;t quite have the impact one would wish for, but, nevertheless, while &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot; left me wanting more, at the same time the ending felt right. The themes of horrors and wonders of humanity &amp; family values are served well. We cannot forget that the movie also looks gorgeous, has a decent original score, well made action sequences &amp; even features a few bloody scenes for the horror fans. In summary, &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot; kinda looks like, feels like and plays out like a big-screen movie.\n\nI think this movie could&apos;ve been a little less convoluted, with a different, less straight forward mystery building structure, but the result is still engaging, handsome and thoughtful thriller piece. My rating: 7/10.",

The reason I&apos;m rating it so low is that it is ridiculous that the animal slaughters were done using live animals, (7 animals were killed in the making of this video, though only 6 are shown) which was completely unnecessary as they clearly had the skills to depict realistic murder/slaughter/rape/gore scenes as shown by all the gruesome events featuring humans. The only good thing to come out of this is that very few movies afterwards ever used real animals becausr of all the backlash this one received.",

      "reviewBody": "An old saying repeated in Ritesh Batra&apos;s charming The Lunchbox is that sometimes the wrong train will bring you to the right station. In this case, however, the train turns out to be a dabba (lunchbox), wrongly delivered by a dabbawala to a middle-aged government claims adjuster on the brink of retirement. It works out well even though, in reality, with about 5,000 dabbawalas in the city of Mumbai who deliver more than 130,000 lunch boxes each day, they rarely make a mistake. Written by Stefan Tomke in the mode of You Got Mail, Ila (Nimrat Kaur), a young housewife dutifully prepares a lunch for her emotionally distant husband every day and has it sent to him via the courier.\n\nOn the advice of her upstairs Auntie, Mrs. Deshpande (Bharati Achreka), Ila tries to have her husband notice her by putting more spice in the food. When it is wrongly delivered to Saajan (Irrfan Khan, Life of Pi), however, a series of unintended consequences unfold. What begins with a short note from Sajaan to Ila that &quot;the food was salty today&quot; develops into a series of exchanges passed back and forth in the lunchbox everyday in which the two open up to each other about their lives, memories, and their hopes and dreams for the future. A subplot involving Aslam Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), an aggressively upbeat successor to Sajaan, adds a touch of humor to the proceedings but also serves to draw a contrast between himself and the grumpy Saajan.\n\nBoth Aslam and Sajaan become more endearing, however, as the film progresses. While the ending may thwart expectations if you are used to having all the pieces neatly fit together, The Lunchbox mixes food and romance in a very appealing combination, removing any doubt that Ila and Sajaan have moved to a new level. Impeccably acted and beautifully realized, the film provides an honest appreciation of what it is like to live in Mumbai without exploiting its poverty for Western audiences. Though the wrong train may indeed bring you to the right station, ultimately there is no wrong train and no right station. As The Lunchbox demonstrates, there is just the train and the journey, and it&apos;s all perfect.",

This leads to that and that leads to something else and that leads to this and so on. What is special about this film, is that everything is connected. This is not Tarantino nonsense, that has no point and simply tries to rely on gimmicks and witty dialog. This is a clever thriller. The story centers around Corky, Violet and Caesar, who in one way or another, are involved in a plan to scam the mob. Of course, scamming the mob is never a good idea. Issues of trust, loyalty, love, violence and everything else are covered. There are very arousing sex scenes and scenes of disturbing violence, utilizing pruning shears. All of it choreographed beautifully by two very talented brothers. However,it is Joe Pantoliano who steals the show. He plays a wiseguy that gets caught in a downward spiral that can only finish one way, but he does his best to delay it. How he was omitted by the Academy is beyond me. To the pompous nitwits that peck away at this film, I have one question. What Hollywood films in the last ten years can you reel off that were nearly as clever as this film? Yeah, I thought so. **** out of ****, a simply brilliant motion picture.",

Hasn&apos;t been a box office hit or getting much in the way of good reviews, but if basic alien invasion is your cup of tea, you will probably enjoy it too. I liked the aliens, not your usual lot, and the Moscow sets. The cast gave decent performances as well. I would have liked to see more of the invaders and would have liked a few more battle scenes, and could have enjoyed it just as well without the 3D effects. All things considered, I will add it to my collection when it&apos;s available on disc. Catch this during a matinée if you must, but you&apos;ll probably like it a whole lot more on a theater&apos;s big screen than waiting for HBO.",

That&apos;s one thing I have to say: Just because we have computer effects, doesn&apos;t mean we have to use them. But, so far, hoping there will be no more sequels, this was a good ending. I think.

      "reviewBody": "Eighty American workers in Bogota get locked inside their office building and an announcement over the intercom gives them half an hour to kill any two of the employees. When they don&apos;t comply, the rules are amped up, and an American Battle Royale (down to the &apos;collars&apos;) ensues. \n\nThe Belko Experiment managed to accomplish the difficult feat of never being boring, not even for a minute. It takes almost no time getting going, and at any given moment it is either action packed, or taking a break from action and descending into dark humour. Both of these were well-executed, with one particularly memorable action piece (the end of round 2, so pretty), and a spattering of interesting side characters, a lot of them hilarious in either attitude or demeanor. With that, it managed to entertain throughout, making it worth seeing. \n\nHowever, where it fails is originality. The Battle Royale formula has been done time and time again, and here we get the straightest form of it, with zero deviation from the norm and zero unique perspective. Where a movie like Circle tries to infuse some kind of basic examinations of social themes, here there is no higher level to the killings. And for this, the movie never once surprises with a thought or an event. The characters are just shells of people; the bad guys are caricatures of evil, the protagonists of good. There is never ambiguity of character, in a movie where so much moral ambiguity should be present due to the situation. So from minute one you know exactly who will be a villain and who will be a hero, and the end game is obvious from the start. It&apos;s a waiting game for the movie to arrive where you know it is going, which makes it very unsatisfying once the action is over.",

      "reviewBody": "If aliens exist, and if they have access to the films made from Earth, they would likely make a mental note to remind themselves that should they visit our planet on terms other than a hostile takeover or annihilation, to avoid landing in the USA at all costs. Hollywood has enough dough to continuously churn out effects laden science-fiction movies, and most of them are big budgeted action fests like Independence Day and Men In Black, which don&apos;t exactly paint a good picture of the extra-terrestrials. Aliens who have more benign intent, would be frightened by how trigger happy and violence prone the US is toward illegal aliens, even if popular culture meant the landing zone for extra terrestrials is the USA and not other larger countries.\n\nRace to Witch Mountain being Disney fare means the toning down of practically everything to ensure that it is safe for the entire family to experience together. Dwayne Johnson seems right at home in family friendly flicks like The Game Plan (also directed by Andy Fickman), and I guess his action days on screen will be few and far between, especially when he gets to flaunt his dramatic and comedic flair. Woe is the fan boy like me who have grown up with The Rock, but there&apos;s no more people&apos;s eyebrow, and we should start to get used to seeing our idol in a different light on celluloid.\n\nJohnson plays a Las Vegas cab driver Jack Bruno who has a colourful past that he tries to bury, in order to earn an honest living to buy his dream Mustang featured in the Steve McQueen movie Bullit. In a confluence of the stars he picks up a scientist who specializes in extra terrestrials, before chancing onto two of them when they boarded his cab without his knowledge. The brother and ssister aliens  Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) and Seth (Alenxander Ludwig)  are here on a noble mission, and are in hot pursuit by the shady government agents led by Henry Burke (Ciaran Hinds) as well as something like a Terminator from many light years away.\n\nThis naturally gives rise to your standard set action sequences where we get to see the alien twins exercise their rather innocent demeanour (&quot;they&apos;re only kids!&quot;) to their advantage, behind which hides the immense powers they possess such as Telepathy and Density manipulation, which I thought was a very cool power to have. Imagine being able to pass through walls, yet having tremendous strength in the form of a road block, literally. AnnaSophia Robb whom I felt did a fantastic job in The Bridge to Terabithia, stars as the female child, and because of her character&apos;s ability, she brings forth a more trusting, and empathetic character, in direct contrast to the other alien Seth (The Seeker from The Dark is Rising is all grown up now), who&apos;s more direct, commanding, aloof and untrusting of humans in general, no doubt their initial experience was in having their space ship confiscated to Witch Mountain, and being chased for the conduct of experiments.\n\nCarla Gugino, last seen as the aged Silk Spectre in Watchmen, got active only in the last third of the show, which was somewhat of a pity because she shared great chemistry with the rest of the cast, and got involved quite late into the thick of things. But of course if there&apos;s any consolation, like how the bits during the end credits would suggest, and depending on the box office results, there might be room for more in a sequel, if it comes. \n\nThere are references galore in the film given that there&apos;s a science-fiction convention event featured in the movie, and you can&apos;t help but also think about the potential for theme park rides with the yellow cab being pursued and pretty banged up. In fact I was wondering each time the cab got put through an action sequence, that it would make for a great 4D ride in Disneyland. You can&apos;t help it because it was quite in your face, with the sequences designed in that manner, deliberately or otherwise.\n\nDespite some glaring plot loopholes, Race to Witch Mountain has all the ingredients for a great family outing. The story doesn&apos;t try to be more intellectual than it can handle, and doesn&apos;t let the special effects run wild and take over everything else. For being such a sentimental fool, the ending also got some brownie points from me, as it&apos;s tough not to shed a tear or two given the trials and tribulations from which a solid bond is formed amongst all the characters. Recommended for a family outing, but don&apos;t go expecting something out of this world (pun not intended), as everything&apos;s pretty formula.",

The visual aesthetics and period recreation are praised, but the script is noted for its simplicity and lack of subtlety. Overall, 'The Apprentice' is a mixed bag with strong performances and themes, yet significant storytelling and character development flaws.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Apprentice&quot; doesn&apos;t hold back. It doesn&apos;t try to be objective or find nuance where there is none; instead, it dives headfirst into the rise of a young Donald Trump, portraying him as a man shaped by manipulation, lack of scruples, and relentless ambition. This isn&apos;t a traditional biopic-it&apos;s a reconstruction of how his mindset was forged, leading him to become a figure who would later leave a profound mark on American politics.\n\nSebastian Stan takes on the challenge of portraying Trump without resorting to caricature or exaggerated imitation. His performance is unsettling because he captures not just the speech patterns and mannerisms, but also the calculated opportunism that defines him. Alongside him, Jeremy Strong plays Roy Cohn, Trump&apos;s mentor and a pivotal figure in his development. Strong&apos;s presence is magnetic, making it clear that Cohn&apos;s influence was instrumental in shaping Trump&apos;s worldview.\n\nAli Abbasi directs with a firm hand, avoiding unnecessary embellishments. The film works as a stark examination of corruption, power, and the dangerous alliances that can transform an individual into a media monster. It&apos;s a raw depiction that makes it clear that impunity and cynicism are essential tools in the world it portrays.\n\nIf The Apprentice has a flaw, it&apos;s that it doesn&apos;t always delve deeply into the psychology of its central character. It presents the events but sometimes lacks a more detailed analysis of his inner motivations. However, the emotional impact is undeniable.\n\nIn the end, the film accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do: it unsettles. There is no redemption, no unexpected twists-just a stark exposure of a transformation where anything goes in the pursuit of power. If you already despised Trump before watching, by the end, that feeling will have only intensified.",

      "reviewBody": "Edward Norton has Tourette&apos;s Syndrome, which comes out when he is stressed, which does not include driving a car, or getting into a gunfight or walking into a strange location when you expect them to kill you. He works for Bruce Willis, who runs a detective agency out of Brooklyn. Willis gets kidnapped and shot, so Norton is the man in the shop who is supposed to track down the killer. This leads him on a tour of an alternate 1956 New York City, which seems to be populated by great actors like Willem Dafoe, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Cherry Jones, Bobby Cannavale and Alec Baldwin as a megalomaniac closely modeled on Robert Moses. One of them is the bad guy. Guess which and why.... I had it figured out four minutes before Norton did, but then, I don&apos;t have Tourette&apos;s. Still, that means it&apos;s a fair mystery.... not who, but why.\n\nMostly, though, it&apos;s a chance for actors to strut their stuff, and none more so than Norton, who besides having Tourette&apos;s has an eidetic memory, smokes pot to control his symptoms, and will never be rich. No one seems to be put off by his tics, including touching women, making comments which are mildly lewd, making noises while jazz musicians play, and in one scene where he is trying to light a lady&apos;s cigarette, repeatedly lighting a match and blowing it out before it can get to the cigarette. Everyone is astonishingly enlightened, except, of course, Baldwin. Being evil, he hates poor people, and Blacks in particular.\n\nGood acting, but when I want to visit 1956 New York City, I don&apos;t want everyone there to be from 2019. Still, some great acting, some great locations, and the CGI recreation of Penn Station revives my anger towards the morons who tore it down.",

      "reviewBody": "The Woman in Gold is based on the true story about a woman, Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren), and her lawyer, Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds), as they attempt to reclaim ownership of an extremely valuable painting (along with a few more) form the Austrian government nearly fifty years after it was stolen by the Nazis. This film has three distinct parts that intertwine through the duration of the show. First, there is a family dynamic that focuses on the emotional stress of the current situation on everyone&apos;s personal lives. There is a strong connection between Randol and Maria that grows over time and is given time to grow in these segments. Second, there are flashbacks that dive deeper into Maria&apos;s past and emphasize the importance of the artwork as well as explore parallels between the past and the present. Finally there is the trial itself, which is where the action of the conflict lies. This is the least important, yet still necessary part of the story. The percentage of time given to these segments would be around 40/40/20, respectively. While you might be surprised how much of the story takes place in the past, it really does drive the plot. There are many white-knuckle scenes and heart wrenching moments that really add to the film. The past is just as important as the present in this movie, and that is exactly what the film is trying to say. Helen Mirren, as always, was amazing in this film. She was subtle and drove many of the scenes that required raw emotion. Ryan Reynolds was also very good and his role in this film might have been his best performance (from what I have seen). Actually, all of the actors did a fantastic job here. Everyone was on there A-Game and gave it everything they had. There was great chemistry between Mirren and Reynolds which made their characters&apos; connection even more compelling. Reynolds was able to subtly change his character as the case slowly changed his motivations. While, yes, there are a few clichéd scenes that were put in there for emotional levity and drama, but they don&apos;t really take much away, if anything. This was an excellent film and I highly recommend it.",

      "name": "Achieves Excellence!",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; is a movie which has achieved excellence.  The story line is fast-moving and packed with nuance.  Various elements of the plot overlap and blend for a harmonious whole.  It is not a series of action scenes played primarily for visual impact, but a compelling story which demands attentive viewing.\n\nFlashback scenes are intentionally cartoonish, so that the audience, like the character of the boy Walter, is left wondering whether the fantastic tales of the old uncles&apos; adventurous youth are really to be believed. Uncle Garth tells the stories, which we see through Walter&apos;s imagination.  We see in the flashbacks what Walter envisions as he hears the stories, and Walter doesn&apos;t have the age and experience to see anything other than the caricatures which appear in the flashback scenes.  It&apos;s not a photo-accurate rendition, it&apos;s what a youngster imagines while listening to oral storytelling.  For instance, a twelve-year-old Texan in the 1950s wouldn&apos;t have been likely to know what a really angry Sheik would have looked like in the 1920s.  These flashbacks, and the ways in which they are depicted, are central to the plot of the movie.  Through his storytelling, without realizing it, Uncle Garth nurtures a creative potential in Walter (who will grow up to become a cartoonist).\n\nChristian Kane is a magnificent casting choice as young Uncle Hub (the younger incarnation of Duvall&apos;s character), displaying just the right kind of spark for the daring adventurer.  Kyra Sedgwick is eerily believable as Walter&apos;s shallow and self-absorbed mother.  The family of hick relatives is superbly annoying.\n\nHaley Joel Osment delivers a solid portrayal of Walter.  Sometimes his voice sounds like that of a boy, sometimes like that of a young man, as would be expected in a male of Walter&apos;s age.  Sometimes Walter cries like a child, sometimes he displays stoic maturity, as would be expected from a boy who is in the transition of becoming a man.  We see Walter unsure of himself in the beginning, but later finding his footing.  Not too sugary, not too hard-edged, Haley Joel Osment is ideal for the role.  He may be overshadowed by Caine and Duvall, but actually holds his own reasonably well, working between these two living legends.\n\nMichael Caine&apos;s accent as Uncle Garth is a perfect portrayal of a Texan who has lived outside Texas for much of his life.  Garth is no bumpkin hick, but a man who has traveled the world, and in light of his experiences it would not have been credible to give this character a strong country drawl. Even though, as the plot progresses, we don&apos;t know how much of Garth&apos;s fantastic storytelling we should believe, there is never a question of whether Garth has ventured outside the Texas borders.  (Education and travel tend to have the effect of diminishing regional accents.  I have lived in Texas for twenty years, and have known many older native Texans whose diction is much like Garth&apos;s.)  Michael Caine gives Uncle Garth just the right combination of toughness and tenderness, and treads the fine line of allowing us to see Garth as a trustworthy character regardless of his adventurous stories.\n\nThe uncles are very realistic characterizations, and Texas holds many characters like them.  The aging uncles had, as young men, gone away to find adventure, and lived on the edge for much of their lives.  Then they returned home to retire in a rural Texas setting which they were finding to be just a little too tame, no longer remembering much about Texas country life except for acquiring the obligatory too many dogs.  The uncles don&apos;t say much to each other because there is no need to say much, they understand each other perfectly.  Confronted with age, they seek out reckless behavior, unwilling to sit still and get older, unable to overtly give up on life. Walter&apos;s presence suddenly requires them to adapt to new purpose, and to take care of themselves, too, as they are faced with the issue of providing appropriate male role models so that their young nephew might one day become an appropriate man.\n\nDespite the studio&apos;s description, this is not a &quot;heartwarming&quot; movie with a happy, fluffy resolution for all concerned.  The characters must make choices, and not always easy ones.  The valiant tales of adventure don&apos;t always conclude with happily-ever-after fairytale endings.  It is not purely a comedy, but instead probes the depths of emotion.  The adult audience will probably appreciate this movie the most, but it is an appropriate movie for pre-teens as well.",

It&apos;s Almodovar&apos;s meatiest and most complex script in years. Although you may be confused early on as you&apos;re trying to figure out whats going on, its all revealed later and very satisfyingly. Gael Garcia Bernal is outstanding in his multi-dimensional, multi-character performance. Alberto Iglesia&apos;s music is wonderful--a homage to Bernard Herrmann.\n\nThe film is rated NC-17, which has more to do with the MPAA Board&apos;s homophobia than anything else. Sure, its a sexy drama with elements adult plotpoints, but had the sex scenes in this film been between a man and a woman, rather than two men, this would have easily gotten an R rating. All of the sex scenes are artfully filmed (there is no frontal nudity) and even the subplot concerning a pedophile priest is handled with care."

      "reviewBody": "The parallels between this film and The Exorcist are obvious even from the trailers, so I won&apos;t go too far into that. Just suffice it to say that The Possession contains none of the impact or shock value that The Exorcist has. In short, it&apos;s just not as good of a film.\n\nHowever, in its own right, it&apos;s a pretty competent horror movie. The story of the central characters is kind of cliché. Husband and wife have divorced, they share custody of the children, there&apos;s a new boyfriend/girlfriend in the picture, etc. This type of set up is always convenient when dealing with a &quot;messed up kid&quot; film. That way whatever is wrong with the child can inevitably be blamed on the fact that the child is just not dealing well with the break up of his or her parents. And that&apos;s exactly what happens in The Possession; except there is actually something VERY wrong with the youngest daughter and it has absolutely nothing to do with her parents. Without giving away too much, the plot centers around an ancient wooden box the youngest daughter finds at a yard sale. Of course she wants it, and so she gets it. And there begins to occur some rather strange phenomena; most of them downright spooky, a couple kind of hokey.\n\nAll in all, I was pleased. This film has got good pacing, decent acting, and exceptional cinematography. There&apos;s not much I can find as a fault here. If I had to name my major complaint about this and similar movies it would be this: I&apos;m not thrilled about the influx of PG-13 horror films. I&apos;ve a suspicion this is due to a need to bring in a wider audience (younger viewers/teenagers), and make more money on ticket sales. Because of this the final product tends to be a little too watered down for my tastes. The Possession shows a lot of promise, but I can&apos;t help but wish the writers/director would have pushed the envelope a bit more; fleshed out the story. Then it would have been great. As it stands now, I&apos;ll just say it&apos;s a &quot;good&quot; little horror film. Nothing that will be talked about this time next year, but I consider my money well spent.\n\nMy rating: 6.5/10",

Joan and Jack agree to go their separate ways. Ralph (Danny DeVito) seeks revenge against Jack for getting left in prison. They are met by Tarak who has just tried to assassinate Omar.

Omar blows up Jack&apos;s boat and Tarak warns him that Joan is in danger.\n\nI love &apos;Romancing the Stone&apos;. This sequel has lost the original&apos;s charm. It&apos;s stupider and less funny. The joy is mostly gone. Jack and Joan start off on a sour note and is mostly separated in the first half. There are flashes of the old chemistry for the couple. However, even that isn&apos;t enough to make this a good movie. It&apos;s a sad sequel to a great 80s movie.",

It is a tongue in cheek take on old school martial arts films and I for one enjoyed it a lot. The fight scenes were outrageous and rightfully so. If you appreciate the beauty of Asian women then you are in for a real treat with this film. The plot wasn&apos;t deep but it wasn&apos;t meant to be. It is just a bit of fun and nostalgic for the films made by such production companies as golden harvest. Sometimes a guy wants to watch a movie and not have to think and this is the perfect film for that.\n\nI found it interesting that Russell Crowe was in this film. He must have quite a sense of humour. Casting Batista I thought was pretty good as the character suited him well. Lucy Liu is always sassy and I the other actors brought some much needed humour to the movie."

      "reviewBody": "We all know that Yorgos Lanthimos can make great movies, and he has proven this several times in the past. While his films are often uniquely creative and explore fascinating themes, they are also vastly different from the majority of other movies and therefore not for everyone. The best example might be Kinds of Kindness, which is so bizarre and radically different from most other films that it&apos;s almost unbearable.\n\nThere might be people who enjoy this type of movie, and I can certainly appreciate its unique perspective, which results in a one-of-a-kind piece with many intriguing elements. However, the overall experience was not entertaining for me at all. The production is undeniably stellar, featuring a stacked cast, all of whom deliver great performances.\n\nThe movie is structured as an anthology, split into three stories, with the main actors appearing in each story as different characters. While this approach has been done before, it remains a risky choice because it can easily confuse the audience or weaken the overall narrative. The themes explored are interesting and yet, paradoxically, not engaging at all. Each of the three unique, distinctive stories has an intriguing premise, but none of them truly deliver.\n\nIn the end, not one of the three stories was satisfying, and all concluded rather uneventfully. While there may be viewers who genuinely enjoy this movie, it is certainly not for everyone. If the first 30 minutes don&apos;t appeal to you, it&apos;s unlikely the rest will either. Additionally, there was no justification for this film to be stretched to almost three hours, as much of it could have been cut. Ultimately, the final result felt boring, pretentious, and frustrating. [5,1/10]",

There are many intense scenes throughout the movie, and Norton and Farrell match them with their own intensity. Voight is believable and realistic as the patriarch of the family of cops and the chief, trying to keep his family in order as he thinks it should be.\n\nDespite the inspired performances of the main characters, however, Pride and Glory falls short due to awkward pacing, pointlessly convoluted side-stories revealed in equally pointless scenes, and a general lack of focus. Pride and Glory tries to tell two or three stories at once, but fails to really punctuate any one of them, leading to a fairly emotionless climax and no discernible, unifying theme. The result is a forgettable movie and a hint of buyer&apos;s remorse; if you&apos;re a big enough fan of Ed Norton or Colin Farrell and want to see either of them put on a great performance, catch the matinée, or even still, wait a few months and rent it.",

One doesn&apos;t feel deeply about the movie&apos;s rather sketchily drawn characters, weakening the dramatic moments, and the comedy, while more hit than miss, does miss more than one would like.

Like Rocky Horror Picture Show, Congo and Jingle All the Way, Flash Gordon is a sort of guilty pleasure of mine. The costumes are quite extravagant and the sets are exotic. Then you have an irresistibly killer soundtrack from Queen, who also brought us the classics We Will Rock You and Bohemian Rhapsody. The direction is pretty good and the acting is surprisingly great. Sam J Jones is bad with his cheesiness but he was fun besides, thank goodness he wasn&apos;t bland like Justin Whalin from Dungeons and Dungeons, and Melody Anderson is charming and alluring as Dale. Brian Blessed is very hammy as Vultran but he is great fun regardless and Topol, who was so superb in Fiddler on the Roof, is memorable as Dr Hans Zarkov. And while Ornella Muti is a wonderfully witty and sexy Princess Aura, it is Max Von Sydow who walks away with the picture, pantomime of course but sinister as well and I appreciated that. Overall, not perfect and camp personified, but very enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

This is definitely not a film to miss when it is released. Lee Tamahori is a skilled director who has his flaws when it comes to his films, but overall he has a very good record behind him (Next, Die Another Day, Along Came A Spider). The acting in this film is good (especially Dominic Cooper), the deliverance is spectacular, and the overall tone and feel for the characters and setting is very realistic. With great effects, cinematography, and writing, this film is, hands-down, one of the best Indie films ever created. I&apos;d see this in theaters twice, given the chance to. I&apos;m sure Latif Yahia will be satisfied with this Indie masterpiece\n\n8.5/10 Stars****",

The non-linear narrative is ambitious, offering fresh perspectives but occasionally disrupting flow. Emotional depth and poignant moments are frequently praised, though some find the story predictable or pacing uneven. Cinematography and score enhance the emotional core. Despite mixed opinions on structure and predictability, it is generally seen as emotionally resonant.",

Even Pedro was underwhelming in this role. It felt as though Celine Song was attempting to make this film have an incredibly deep and moving message, but it didn&apos;t come across as she intended. They marketed this movie as a rom-com, disappointing me when I realized it wasn&apos;t. It could have been redeemed by a compelling story but the poor acting and awkward conveyance of a boring intended message proved the film irredeemable. Anyone other than Dakota Johnson would&apos;ve worked better. Next time cast Daisy Edgar Jones.",

      "reviewBody": "I thought this movie had an interesting premise to work off of- the enmity between cats and dogs. However, one problem I had with it (besides its general low quality) was the fact that the cast the cats as the criminal buffoons. (Bear with me please - I&apos;m at least half serious). I mean, dogs as the smart ones? Come on. Cats taking over the world is believable, but casting most of them as the not-so-smart, criminal stooges was going a bit far. Cats are smarter and more, hmm, elegant than dogs. Face it, in a showdown between cats and dogs that wasn&apos;t purely reliant on mass or strength, cats would own the dogs.\n\nNow if they had cast the dogs as the villains of the piece...that would be better. Cats like the position they&apos;re in - pampered and very little required of them- why go to the trouble of taking over and running the world when it already serves you? Another thing- dogs are the ones who chase the cats, very rarely the other way around- bit of insecurity or jealousy perhaps? Dogs also often have to actually perform, exercise, do handy things or otherwise. If they would play it as the dogs trying to oust all the freeloading superior cats....that could have been real fun.",

      "reviewBody": "Thankyou to Richard Attenborough for this film.  I watched it many a time and enjoyed both the biographical aspect and the comedic one but it has also increased my interest in silent comics of this great era.\n\nThe film begins by exploring the early life of Charlie, his Brother Sid and his Mother as they try to scrape a living.  Thankfully Attenborough doesn&apos;t concentrate too much on this deprived part of Chaplin&apos;s life. However it does reveal interesting facts about Charlie that he never forgot during his rise to superstardom.\n\nAlthough Chaplin is played by younger actors at the begining it is the arrival of Robert Downey Jnr which Chaplin fans will anticipate the most. He puts in an amazing performance, his London accent is excellent and ability to do slapstick even better he also really makes you believe that the great man is alive and on the screen again.\n\nThe film rightly concentrates on the private life of Chaplin and the development of the cinema.  Whilst others may want to see the film concentrate on Chaplin&apos;s great pictures e.g The Kid, Gold Rush, and the Great dictator Attenborough blends the creation of these films into specific turning points in Charlie&apos;s life.  For example Modern times is used to show Chaplin&apos;s sympathy towards victims of the wall street crash, as he knew what it was like to be extremely poor.  His Jewish connections are also highlighted by the Great dictator,  which shows his sensitivities to the European Jews were more at heart than just a making a heap of cash by having a laugh at Hitler&apos;s moustache and goose stepping troops.\n\nThe film doesn&apos;t get bogged down by Chaplin&apos;s hectic love life, as Dickie explores Charlie&apos;s political beliefs and how J Edgar Hoover was convinced of he was a communist party member.  By doing so it shows how Hoover was one of the most twisted individuals to hold public office,  with a dangerous obsession on peoples private lives and background.\n\nThe film does a good job in showing how important silent stars were and how we should not forget that they were the true greats when films were developing all the time from shorts to feature length, from silent to sound.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Friday the 13th&apos; may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror&apos;s most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all of.\n\nLiked the first two &apos;Friday the 13th&apos; films, despite not exactly considering them great. Had mixed feelings on the third film, but it is one of the more watchable follow-ups. This fourth instalment for me is the second best of the sequels, and although one knows that it was not the &apos;Final Chapter&apos;, the general consensus is that it should have been and that there was no need for the rest. Have to completely agree with this, to me &apos;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&apos; was the last average and above of the series. \n\nIt may not be a great film, neither were the previous three. The story is paper thin and there is not much new. Again, while actually the best acted film of the whole series, some of the acting is far from what one would call good. \n\nThe dialogue, as can be expected (the &apos;Friday the 13th&apos; films are not to be seen for the script), is awfully crude, cheesy and simplistic, and most of the characters are as dim-witted and underdeveloped as ever (though other sequels did this aspect far worse). There is some unintentional humour here and there that dissipates at times the generally very well done atmosphere.\n\nHowever, there are three performances that are actually the best of the whole series. Corey Feldman in his prime is appealing, showing that it was a shame that his personal life went as down the toilet in the way that it did since. Crispin Glover is lots of fun in his role and Ted White is one of the scariest Jasons.\n\nVisually, &apos;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&apos; has grit and professionalism and the effects and make-up are simply terrific and steal the show even more than Jason. There is plenty of suspense and tension that was missing in the third film, with a return to deaths and moments that are creative and unsettling. The film contains the best ending of the series, certainly of the sequels, truly nightmarish. There is far less padding too. \n\nOverall, decent, one of the series&apos; best and the last one to be average or above. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

However, Cliff finds a package hidden by one of the gangsters with a rocket with belts and they find that the device allows man to fly. Meanwhile, his beloved girlfriend and aspirant actress Jenny Blake (Jennifer Connelly) succeeds in an audition to make a small part in a movie of the great actor Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton) that is ranked the third in box-offices. During a flight exhibition, the mechanic Malcolm (Eddie Jones) has an accident, and Cliff uses the rocket to save him, being called Rocketeer by the public. With his picture in the front page of the newspaper, Cliff is chased by the FBI, the gangsters and German spies that abduct Jenny and forces Cliff to rescue her.\n\n&quot;Rocketeer&quot; is a delightful adventure that recalls those classics from the old times of Hollywood. There is a handsome hero, a gorgeous heroine, gangsters, Nazi spies, betrayals, in a pace of cartoons with a magnificent art decoration, cars and costumes recreating Hollywood in the late 30&apos;s. The story has great lines and uses real characters, like Clark Gable and Howard Hughes, in fictional situations. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Rocketeer&quot;",

It is atmospheric, with excellent cinematography and a very beautiful classical soundtrack. The story weaves from one relationship to another without getting confusing, even though they do not occur in chronological order. The emotions portrayed are rich and varied. I am particularly impressed by Ziyi Zhang&apos;s performance in the film as a woman who makes the transition from being strong willed and independent woman to being desperately in love. The plot is complex and will require many viewings to understand what it is about. There is a lot of imagery in the film, and many of them I have not been able to spot if I had not read the other comments here. This film is really a piece of art!"

      "reviewBody": "People who know Xavier Dolan know what they&apos;re walking into when they buy a ticket for Mommy. While he has a loyal fanbase that seems to grow more passionate about him by each film, some don&apos;t like him at all. This is my first of his films and I can immediately see the case for both sides. However, as Mommy is being called his most mature work yet, I take pause to imagine how infantile his previous films are as this has its moments of worrisome juvenility, though the &apos;mature&apos; moments have a gutsy weight. At only 25 years old and on his 5th film in as many years, there&apos;s a cathartic energy to the way he approaches cinema that is quite refreshing to see. He throws everything at the wall and sees what sticks. Some of it does, but I regret to say, much of it doesn&apos;t, and what falls off drags the film down. \n\nFrequent headliner for Dolan&apos;s previous films and having starred in 4 of the 5, Mommy stars Anne Dorval as the titular character Diane &apos;Die&apos; Despres, in a whirlwind performance of tantalizing vigor and sensitivity. She&apos;s a widowed single mother who takes her thuggish son Steve, played by Antoine-Olivier Pilon, back home after his time runs out at a delinquent center due to an incident where he caused another boy to be seriously burned. Arguments in their house always escalate to the point of violence, but they find solace in bonding with their stuttering but kind-hearted (with a lioness bouncing inside) neighbor Kyla, enticingly played by Suzanne Clement, who begins to tutor Steve so he can have the potential for a future. \n\nImmediately you can feel Dolan&apos;s hand ready to sculpt the film beyond reason. It begins as an unnecessary fantasy set next year with a fictional law to serve the plot. Perhaps it needs this disconnection from reality. It&apos;s wired with high-strung melodrama that escalates outrageously. Granted, that is the point of the film, that a little spark can ignite a forest fire, but it crosses a line where it ceases to be involving or convincing, and nor is it darkly comical. At first it&apos;s difficult to invest in the film, the characters are so unlikeable and unsympathetic, victims of their own tempers and ignorance. Dorval wins you over handedly, channeling Marisa Tomei better than Tomei herself. She&apos;s grounded enough to make the drama work. However, Pilon overdoes the irritation to the point where you sincerely don&apos;t wish him to succeed and that&apos;s a major problem with the performance and the way Dolan treats him. It&apos;s unbearably obnoxious. \n\nBut when it&apos;s finally toned down in the tense calms before or after the storm, it&apos;s really great. It&apos;s thoroughly embroiling, enrapturing and heart-breaking drama, or a complete joy depending on the scene. That&apos;s the flipside of a film that&apos;s heightened to 11 on either end of the scale. It was constantly losing me and winning me back. Eventually, the losses were weaker and the wins were stronger. Sometimes the stylistic indulgences were enjoyable and added to the tone. Otherwise they disrupt the flow of the film entirely, with the use of slow motion, out of focus shots and unnecessary interludes of music videos. Those of which were poorly chosen iconic tracks that I can&apos;t tell whether Dolan actually knows how done to death and unsalvageable the Dido and Oasis songs are for instance. He exercises zero restraint – but he does not care. There&apos;s somewhat of a charm to his contrarianism. \n\nWhat&apos;s most fascinating about the film and what particularly sets it apart given the familiarity of this type of melodrama is the aspect ratio. It&apos;s boxed in at an unusual 1:1, imprisoning the characters so they feel crushed by the weight of the stresses of their personalities and consequences of their actions. It occasionally breaks free of it when hope floods back into their lives. It&apos;s an incredibly expressive way to use the space of a frame, much more emotional than the intellectual way Wes Anderson did it this year for The Grand Budapest Hotel. As such with a melodrama, the cinematography is vibrant with alluring colour, making good use of that voyeuristic box we watch the story from. Fortunately, when Mommy hits the sweet spot, it&apos;s utterly overwhelming. Dorval is the only consistent aspect in an unashamedly bloated, indulgent and messy film. It could be too polarizing to be a serious contender for the Foreign Language Film Oscar, but a nomination remains to be seen. \n\n7/10 \n\nRead more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)",

It&apos;s dialogue-faithful, the tone is good, and really, if they&apos;ve gotten Conroy and Hamill as the two leads, you know they&apos;re taking this seriously. And that infamous scene is incredibly effective.\n\nBut it&apos;s that first half-hour that doesn&apos;t work. It&apos;s tacked-on and certainly doesn&apos;t do Batgirl or Batman any favors (the latter of whom just seems a tad creepy). This is (for better or worse) the Joker&apos;s origin story, incendiary though it is, and I can understand why they&apos;d want to flesh out Barbara&apos;s character; but it still doesn&apos;t work because Batman doesn&apos;t recall her horrific fate later on in the movie. She&apos;s no longer relevant beyond the shock value. The intentions were there, but it could&apos;ve been done better.\n\nWithin this running time, there are 45 minutes of good movie.

      "name": "Beautifully Made Drama from Poland",
      "reviewBody": "This superbly shot and acted black-and-white drama from Poland is a worthy film from Pawel Pawlikowski. It doesn&apos;t quite live up to his outstanding previous film &quot;Ida,&quot; but it comes close. Like &quot;Ida,&quot; this film runs a fleeting 90 minutes and is shot in black and white using simple (but gorgeous) cinematography. For a film of such short runtime, &quot;Cold War&quot; is deeply ambitious, and for the most part, the ambition pays off. It is set over a considerable period of time both inside and outside of the Iron Curtain, and centers on a love story between a man and his student who meet at a state-run music academy in communist Poland.\n\nThe film&apos;s use of a variety of filmmaking techniques to depict the history and culture of postwar Europe through using historical context is outstanding. The simple and very powerful music is beautiful, as is every key shot in black-and-white. The two leads both give excellent performances, mixing desire for purpose in life with an intense feeling of passion that is prevalent among ambitious individuals in the era. Some of these strengths in the movie are even combined together to excellent results, such as a chilling scene when young women from the state music academy sing songs pledging absolute loyalty to Stalin on stage in performance. The juxtaposition of the different scenes in the movie is also done very well, as each scene simply cuts to black before the next major scene (set in a different region or area of Europe) begins. The only real complaint I have about this film is that while I really appreciated the ending for the most part, the tone of the film&apos;s finale felt slightly anti-climactic. Otherwise, this is a gem. Gladly recommended. 8/10",

But beneath the visage is something even more sinister than he could have possibly imagined.\n\nIt comes under the horror genre, I question that. Is it really? Thriller seems to suit it better.\n\nStarring Michael Sheen in a truly excellent performance by him this grisly, dark, moody little film really got my attention early on but by about half way it seemed to have lost its way. Like the writer had a good idea but didn&apos;t know how to follow through with it.\n\nI&apos;m not saying Apostle is a bad movie, it has some great themes and looks great but from an entertainment perspective it finds itself somewhat lacking. I&apos;m not a person who needs everything spelling out for him, I don&apos;t mind things being left open to interpretation but there is a fine line between that and just leaving things a tad too open.\n\nApostle is a watchable effort with some nice ideas but as for what they were actually aiming for I think it&apos;s a swing and a miss. Shame.\n\nThe Good:\n\nLooks the part\n\nMichael Sheen\n\nA few decent ideas\n\nThe Bad:\n\nDoesn&apos;t really come together very well\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nConcerningly that lifestyle (Minus the religion) oddly appeals to me\n\nChristian torture devices are the stuff of nightmares",

      "name": "Murder in Comfort",
      "reviewBody": "Rating: 6/10\n\nSummary: The Thursday Murder Club feels like a cosy mystery built for an older audience, packed with Oscar-winning talent but light on real intrigue. More about charm, quips, and the eccentricity of its cast than the murder mystery it sets up, it works better as a gentle comedy about retirement-home sleuths than a serious whodunit. If you go in expecting a soft, inoffensive ride - something your parents or grandparents would happily enjoy - it lands well enough. If you expect something sharp or tightly plotted, it falls short.\n\nFull Review: I found this one quite jarring at first, coming straight off Mobland and suddenly seeing Pierce Brosnan and Helen Mirren sharing the screen again, especially with Geoff Bell appearing briefly too. It took me a while to adjust.\n\nThe Thursday Murder Club is an odd film to place. Right away, I&apos;d say it&apos;s a movie I think my dad - who&apos;s nearly 80 - would love. That&apos;s not a criticism so much as a reflection of who this film is really for. And honestly, that&apos;s fine, because it doesn&apos;t pretend otherwise.\n\nWhat&apos;s curious is the weight of the cast: Helen Mirren, Pierce Brosnan, Ben Kingsley, Celia Imrie, Tom Ellis, Jonathan Pryce, and David Tennant - directed by Chris Columbus, no less. With names like that, you&apos;d expect something sharper, maybe even prestige-level. Instead, it plays like a cosy Sunday evening watch, designed to be as inoffensive as possible.\n\nThe story itself is a little muddled. It starts with a cold case, then shifts to a current murder, bouncing between the two while trying to juggle smaller character beats. Some of those beats - like Tom Ellis&apos;s subplot - feel unnecessary, padding out the runtime without adding much. There are fun gimmicks and jokes sprinkled throughout, but a lot of them feel more like sitcom humour than anything driving the mystery forward.\n\nTonally, it&apos;s closer to Only Murders in the Building than something like Knives Out. It even nods in that direction with a podcast joke that feels like a direct wink. But where Only Murders manages to keep its core mystery engaging across seasons, this film never fully commits to its own. You don&apos;t need to think too hard, and when it does try to redirect suspicion, it feels forced rather than clever.\n\nWhat works best is the atmosphere. The retirement community setting is almost utopic, with its castle-like flats and eccentric residents. When the film leans into that vibe - older characters navigating friendship, mischief, and meddling in police work - it&apos;s genuinely fun. The murder plot, oddly enough, feels like the least interesting part.\n\nIn terms of performances, Mirren is the anchor, Brosnan gets a bit more to do through Ellis&apos;s character and family ties, Kingsley is barely used, and Imrie pops up enough to leave an impression. Tennant is reliably entertaining whenever he appears. No one is phoning it in, but they&apos;re also not given much to sink their teeth into.\n\nFor me, it ended up being more enjoyable as a vibe than a story. It&apos;s not really a murder mystery in the classic sense; it&apos;s a light comedy with a mystery tacked on. And as that, it succeeds - it&apos;s exactly the kind of film that parents or grandparents will love, the kind that goes down easily on a quiet night in. But for anyone expecting something sharp or layered, it&apos;s just okay.",

      "reviewBody": "If you read this one exactly as it&apos;s written and take out the Depp character it can play accurately. It would never be a big movie like that (it wasn&apos;t big anyway) but it would be consistent and good. But insert Depp&apos;s character (and Depp&apos;s way of playing this character) and you have something entirely else. The title holds only if you don&apos;t have Depp in the movie - for this movie is all about Depp. He literally steals the show. I don&apos;t know much about Depp, what I&apos;ve heard he is a somewhat weird character, but if you look at what he&apos;s done - Scissorhands and this movie as two examples - you have to wonder if you&apos;re not looking at one of the truly great actors of the day. The diner scene with the two dinner rolls, the tray of dinners, the Wurlitzer and Julianne Moore; the kitchen antics; the jack-in-the-box scene - simple but still; the &apos;mail a letter to momma&apos; scene - look how Depp totally creates his character; and the park scene: this is great stuff. Is it about Benny and Joon and their ability to cope with their situation? Maybe. But moviegoers might remember this essentially &apos;feel good&apos; movie as only another incredible Johnny Depp performance."

      "reviewBody": "I have to be biased here: I love Meth and Redman&apos;s music. Whether it&apos;s solo, in collaborations with others, or when they do an album together. these two are among the premier rappers in the industry. So despite the films heavy emphasis of promoting marijuana use, which I&apos;m not sold on, I had to see this movie, because I&apos;m a big fan of rap music and would rather see these guys in films over the likes of Britney and Mariah any day.\n\nHow High is hilariously funny, but it&apos;s not for everybody. You have to be fans of these fine gentlemen or have a crazy sense of humour. The rappers play Silas and Jamal, two young men who live for their pot and sexing. One day, after a friend of Silas was killed in a hilarious accident, Silas and Jamal are smoking a potent type of pot that gives them a high that allows them to &quot;see dead people&quot;, namely Ivory, the man who was killed in the accident. He is able to give them the answers to all the questions on their SATs and that allows them to go to any college they want, and so they pick Harvard.\n\nThe film has them doing their thing, turning Harvard upside down with their decidedly different attitude and angering the dean (Obba Babatunde, with his name as Dean Cain, after the actor from Superman:The Series).\n\n There are some crazy scenes in this film, such as when they run out of the special pot and they go to a graveyard to dig up the body of President John Quincy Adams, hoping that his brain could help them pass the courses or that weirdo who passes out tickets reacts to seeing his bicycle being destroyed. This film is so out there!\n\nThe acting is actually good and the characters have vibrancy. Also in the film are another great rap group, Cypress Hill, and former NBC alums Anna-Marie Horsford (Amen), Fred Willard (DC Follies), and yes, Lisa from Saved By The Bell (Lark Voorhies).\n\nThe DVD contains a lot of stuff, from the usual documentaries, music videos, commentary, etc to neat things like the &quot;Hide The Stash&quot; game where you have to find Meth and Red&apos;s pot by clicking on the correct 420 and there&apos;s even a preview of Eminem&apos;s &quot;8 Mile&quot; film. All in all, a lot of fun; if you&apos;re like me in my mind frame, see it. This film might be a cult rental like Showgirls and The Doors are for me."

Sure there were some implausible things: the speed of the counter-action, the strange fact that a complete change of the aerodynamics of a stealth bomber seems to cause zero disturbance... But all in all it was well within bearable limits. Don&apos;t expect to see a 100% realistic plot in a movie that is supposed to contain heros! In reality, they usually get shot or explode before they have the chance to become one :-)\n\nCritical Decisions has a more than adequate mix of suspense, better-than-horrible acting, plot twists and mild humor to relieve the tension. Whereas a lot of movies in the same genre totally screw up one or more of those aspects. I&apos;m thinking about the terribly balanced &quot;humor&quot; in The Rock, for example. Killing all tension and involvement..\n\n8/10\n\nJoH",

Jay Baruchel nailed his character with an all around great performance, as did Glenn Howerton. For that matter, all casting and performances were spot on, as was the cinematography and score.

Its no Oscar-winner, the constant moaning of the girls kinda irritated me a few times but overall...scary, but not in an &apos;average shark movie&apos; way, some nice twist and just fun!\n\nSo why this kinda dull review? Well, I read a lot of reviews on IMDb, never feel the urge to write one. But there is something with IMDb reviews which bothers the hell out of me. Allow me:\n\nThere is this guy here (he must be so much fun at parties), who wrote a review presenting 14 reasons or so, why the diving in this movie was impossible/not logical/not realistic or whatever. Therefore, the movie received one star. This bothers me. Why? Allow me again:\n\nSo, I do not dive, but I teach at University. Not really movie material, but let&apos;s say a movie is made about the life of a University teacher (why would you do that you ask? good question). Let&apos;s say in this movie, ALL details about the very complex and technical nature of &apos; University teacher&apos; are impossible/not logical/not realistic. But, the movie is fun and entertaining. Why, oh why in Gods name, would I feel the urge to write a review to correct all these &apos;mistakes&apos; related to something I happen to be an expert in?\n\nIn other words, why do so many reviewers here feel this urge to correct the impossible/not logical/not realistic with regard to something they happen to know a lot of? Just enjoy the movie (or not, if its s*cky), but over-analyzing it from your &apos;expert view&apos;? To be honest, most of us don&apos;t really care about that and just want to enjoy the movie...",

However this film takes so many bizarre twists and turns which I&apos;m not sure all worked. Trust me you have a lot of questions after seeing this film.\n\nVisually stunning I must say though and I love the fact that this is a really ballsy film, 100% original for that matter!! However I think it might have helped if now and then it was just a little boring or normal hahaha!\n\nI mean its an experience I wont forget but then again I wont rush to see this film again any time soon, I think I need to let my brain process this all. I completely understand why a lot of people would hate this film, it really is not for everyone!!\n\n70% out of 100, I&apos;m stunned and shocked how this turned out and the fact that someone thought of this idea for a film.........are they ok?

When you have two major action stars such as Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone one might expect that the testosterone level on the big screen would get a bit heavy especially considering the movies theme is about two old and retired fighters who come out of retirement after 30 years to put the gloves back on and get back in to the ring to settle a very old score since both fighters won one of their two previous matches while in their prime back in the 1980&apos;s.\n\nRobert DeNiro plays Billy &quot;The Kid&quot; McDonnen. Now Billy has a very big ego and since his boxing career ended prematurely 30 years ago he has done pretty good for himself owning his own car dealership and a successful bar called the Knockout. There is one scene in the film that I just grinned from ear to ear as Billy did a stand-up comedy routine in his bar with a puppet dressed as a prize fighter sitting in his corner as Billy bantered back and forth with the prize fighter dummy. The scene is less than a minute long but I give it full credit for the originality.\n\nSylvester Stallone plays Henry &quot;Razor&quot; Sharp. Now Razor was the guy who decided to hang up his gloves in the prime of his fighting career and we eventually find out why he retired. No spoiler alert, you will have to wait and hear it from Razor himself why he chose to retire from the ring. Razor&apos;s life has been kind of frozen in time these past 30 years, and he now works as a laborer in a factory, goes home to an empty house with no TV, cable or internet, and eats canned tuna and over ripened bananas to make ends meet. Razors life seems very depressing. Something is bothering him and the audience gets interested in finding out what makes Razor tick. I would have thought a boxing genre film would have been easier to figure out but the screenwriters did a good job in keeping the plot a bit deeper than most boxing films and we gradually grow to like Razor&apos;s character and think less of Billy the Kid&apos;s shallow and selfish personality.\n\nThere is also a good supporting cast of characters such as Kevin Hart who plays fight promoter Dante Slate Jr.. Dante&apos;s deceased father used to promote Razor&apos;s fights and Razors&apos; memories of Dante Slate Sr. are not very good as he recalls being ripped off of his prize fight earnings. So Razor instantly is not prepared to go back in to the ring with Dante Slate Jr. holding the purse strings. Eventually Dante convinces Razor to put the gloves back on, but only for a fight simulation video for a software video company who agrees to pay him $15K. The movie is worth watching if for nothing else but seeing Stallone and De Niro dressed up in their head to toe lime green leotards game gear costumes so the techies can video their fight simulation. Did I say fight simulation? Well once Billy and Razor are within ring distance of each other the brouhaha goes viral on the internet and &quot;the fight is on man!&quot; We eventually get introduced to Kim Basinger&apos;s character Sally, who plays Razor&apos;s old love interest. Something happened to split Razor and Sally apart 30 years ago and we find out why Razor is a bit disenchanted with his life. When Razor eventually does agree to fight Billy for the grudge match of the decade he asks his old and trusted trainer Louis Lightning Conlon, played by veteran actor Alan Arkin. Louis is currently in a wheelchair and residing in an old age home, but Razor still wants his old and trusted friend Louis to get him back in to fighting shape. Razor is an honorable man and true friend as part of his income is used to pay for his friends nursing home costs. \n\nThere are a couple of scenes that remind us in a fun way of Stallone&apos;s Rocky films that just add to the films humorous theme. Billy on the other hand goes through a few trainers including LL Cool J who plays Frankie Brite, and Billy eventually settles on having his long lost son BJ played smartly by Jon Bernthal to train him.\n\nBefore you know it, we are witness to the fight of the decade in front of 18,000 fight fans split between who they want to win the fight. Most film goers always have their own prediction on who will win the main event. Will Razor win? Will Billy the Kid win? Or maybe it will be a draw? As I said no spoiler alert coming from me, so let&apos;s just say the ending is a good one. No, let me rephrase this..., I would say the ending is even better than I anticipated it would be. I Give Grudge match an 8 out of 10 ranking for the 10 rounds that Grudge Match went. Watch it and you will not be disappointed. It&apos;s a knockout hit.",

But I liked &quot;White Chicks&quot;, I proudly admit, and I like the Waynes brothers, wither you want to admit it or not, they give you a few good laughs in most of their films. So, I figured to just try to give Little Man a chance, what harm could it do? Honestly, it wasn&apos;t that bad, I actually had a decent time watching this.\n\nCalvin is a two foot criminal on the run with a hundred thousand dollar diamond and while running from the cops, puts it in a lady&apos;s purse. Cal and his partner follow the couple and since Calvin is so little and the couple, Darryl and Venessa, wants a baby, Cal dresses up as one and the couple takes him in. Thinking it will be for a short while, Cal does this hoping to get the diamond and run, but it won&apos;t be easy since Darryl is dedicated to being a good dad.\n\nLike I said, I was expecting something really bad, but I had a couple laughs during the film. I honestly don&apos;t understand what people have against the Waynes brothers, while Little Man is in no way Oscar material, it was a silly comedy with a few light hearted laughs.\n\n5/10",

As others have said this film does what it sets out to do, make you laugh, and that it does and then some.\n\nIts stupidity is great and the abuse that Joe (David Spade) receives is just fantastic. If you like watching a lovable loser get abused then this is the movie for you. Lots of laughs and memorable sayings, its a classic, &apos;Life a garden, dig it&apos; and &apos;you can&apos;t have no in your heart&apos; all coming from a white trash loser with a mullet who announces on the radio that he was &apos;jerkin his gherkin&apos;makes for a laughfest.

The film, in my opinion, perfectly captures the homophobia, bigotry, ignorance and curiosity that the LGBT community deals with showing the spectrum of opinions using the right amount of humour. While I can&apos;t speak to the accuracy of the time, I can see my own experiences with LGBT friends of mine and curious people painted across the screen.\n\nThis is a must see movie that will show how hate can harm and will also reinforce your faith in humanity.\n\nThe actors&apos; performances were all amazing and flawless, from tears to dance sequences.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the kind of movie that just pisses me off to no end because it has so much potential, but somehow it comes off as exceedingly mediocre. Jennifer Aniston plays a woman who discovers her family was the model for the novel and film The Graduate. She never saw how she fit in with her family, so she wonders if maybe the model for Benjamin, a rich man named Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner), is her real father. She&apos;s wrong, but in the process of this discovery, she ends up sleeping with the man, thus continuing the tradition of her mother (deceased) and grandmother (played here by Shirley MacLaine). This in turn ruins her relationship with her loving fiancé (Mark Ruffalo). I remember seeing the trailer last fall and thinking, &quot;This is a great idea.&quot; I laughed pretty much constantly during that preview. Unfortunately, it contains most of the film&apos;s best moments. The actual film is more of a romance (or perhaps a better term would be &quot;chick flick&quot;) than a comedy. It gets somewhat sappy, and the whole thing lumbers on and his never very strong. This is especially annoying, as all the actors are actually very good. Aniston proves once again that she is a very good actress (if only she could land some great material). Costner gives his second excellent performance of the year (I thought his performance in The Upside of Anger was perhaps the year&apos;s best performance from an actor). He was so mediocre earlier on, it&apos;s kind of cool to see that maybe he is just now hitting his peak. Mark Ruffalo is very funny, as is Mena Suvari, who plays Aniston&apos;s younger sister. And MacLaine&apos;s role is absolutely golden. She also had a very good performance elsewhere in &apos;05 (In Her Shoes), but she has even more to do here and she flexes her comic muscles. With all that goodness, it really pains me that it&apos;s so hard to muster any enthusiasm for this somewhat lame film!",

For those who don&apos;t know the plot, basically a British student, Anna, falls for Jacob, an American student. They fall for each other right away, and spend the summer together. However, she violates the stay of her student visa, and when she tries to return to L.A., she is denied. Thus, our two lovers are separated by distance and multiple levels of bureaucracy that prove to be most unfair. Can they make it work, and should they? Some have compared it to &apos;500 Days of Summer,&apos; and there are a few similarities. The major difference is the lack of any unique narrative devices and that it is, in fact, a love story. First and foremost, let me say that Felicity Jones as Anna is a revelation. She owns the screen and was utterly charming and devastatingly beautiful. There&apos;s a scene in the first 10 minutes after they spend their first evening together, and they sit on her bed, and a sense of tension but young awkwardness that fills the room. When the conversation falters out, she gives him a look that was filled with such delicate longing; fueled by the power of young love and the possibilities before them. It was in this moment that Anna, and Felicity, won me over. The chemistry between her and her co-star Anton was realistic and powerful. Much of the film was improvised; the director said he would often leave the camera rolling for twenty to thirty minutes at a time just to capture them together. It shows. I felt myself hoping and wishing for them to work it all out, to end up together.\n\nThe music is fantastic. It provides the heartbeat to the film and is a wonderful compliment. It&apos;s well edited - the film ultimately takes place over what seems to be a couple of years. Unlike early versions of the film, title cards have been removed and a series of jump cuts progresses the time. You have to pay close attention at times to have a firm grasp on the passage of time. There are moments when they are happy and together that are so iconic. Walking the streets of London, at times they looked like the cover of a Bob Dylan cover. Quick cuts of them together whether in LA or London are quite beautiful.\n\nThis film was obviously made based on real experiences, and the filmmakers admitted that it was the combination of many of their experiences. It&apos;s a realistic film. Things aren&apos;t easy. You will smile and laugh and other times feel just as much despair as our characters. There are no easy answers in this film, and your ultimate interpretation and perhaps enjoyment of the film depends on what you bring to the table, and your feelings on love, and just how much you believe in it. This film should make Felicity Jones a star in the way that &apos;An Education&apos; benefited Carey Mulligan.",

      "reviewBody": "I appreciate certain actors differently as time goes by. For me Michael J Fox has been on the upswing while others, like Steve Martin, are headed in the other direction. There&apos;s nothing particularly unique about any of the elements of this movie except maybe the combination of all of them. Fox finds he can transform into a werewolf with superhuman powers - his &quot;problem&quot; makes him the most popular guy in high school and creates a winning basketball team. Forget that the wolf playing Fox on the court must be twice his size and four times the athlete, this movie is just a lot of fun to watch, helped considerably by Hampton as the understanding dad and Ursitti as the under-appreciated girl friend. Very rewatchable.",

      "reviewBody": "War tends to find its way in movies the way a car chase, love triangle or training sequence does, as a backdrop for profound introspection (Apocalypse Now) or profound absurdity (Battleship). &apos;71, directed by Yann Demange, which screened at the New York Film Festival, does not concern itself with the impossibility of unraveling the politics behind violence, or implant an over-the- top action sequence, but uses the Northern Ireland conflict of the late 60&apos;s and early 70&apos;s as context, not base.\n\nThe Catholic/ Protestant, or even English/ Irish conflict is not covered in great detail which allows the film to construct its own sensibility: a netherworld where an English soldier sent to Belfast, Gary Hook (Jack O&apos;Connell), must find trust and a way back. Houses are not homes, but bunkers for families supposedly hiding guns and trying to raise children. Bombs are the weapons of choice and children are the only ones with answers, creating a sci-fi texture to the film. This is a thriller and the plot is something you can find out about when you actually see the movie.\n\nWar, conflict (whatever you want to call killing a bunch of people) is an abyss not just of death, but of trust—who values my life? No one. Yet Demange does not attempt to make an affected statement about war, and focuses on the grey of the conflict with Gary as his sharp, contrasting center. As Gary slowly emerges through the desolate streets of Belfast he is greeted by a boy (Corey McKinley) who seems to be his only salvation. The boy struts, demanding respect as he cusses out his fellow &quot;comrades&quot; in a scene that could be strait out of Blade Runner.\n\nDuring the Q&amp;A after the film Demange recalled not wanting McKinley to rehearse too much, he didn&apos;t want an actor, but a real boy who in such a setting needs an armor of bravado to stay alive. McKinley, who Demange found at a boxing ring (he&apos;s 9), preferred boxing to rehearsing in between scenes, and it paid off. Besides O&apos;Connell McKinley is the most memorable actor in the film. O&apos;Connell, who made a mark with This is England and the series Skins, recently burst into films consciousness with the prison drama Starred Up, and is about to find himself in epic American waters with Angelina Jolie&apos;s directorial debut Unbroken. At only twenty-four years of age O&apos;Connell has managed to create a provoking and mature persona. With a gruff low voice and edgy exterior, O&apos;Connell brings a swagger which is unparalleled as almost every scene belongs to him and the film works because of him.\n\nI am a bit afraid after his American debut, O&apos;Connell will somehow loose his edge, but he comes across as smarted than the Hollywood unconsciousness. He has a lot to give us and this is only the beginning, handle with care (300: Rise of an Empire, yeah he&apos;s in that). Although thrillers tend not to be my cup of tea, I like developed characters and layers of plot—&apos;71 takes place in the span of 24 hours—it is still an exceptional piece mainly due to O&apos;Connell&apos;s masterful performance, Demange&apos;s restrained direction and Tat Radcliffe&apos;s stylized cinematography.\n\n&apos;71 is still making the festival rounds and does not yet have a U.S. release date, but will be released in the U.K. on October 10th.\n\n@MeMontgom filmnoises.com",

      "name": "My Bloody Valentine 3-D A Deadly Blind Date",
      "reviewBody": "The use of three dimensional effects have not been a part of cinema for over twenty years, with IMAX the exception, but now it is back and better than ever in 2009. During &quot;My Bloody Valentine 3-D,&quot; the audience will experience large pickaxes, flying bullets and tree limbs coming out of the screen and into your lap. At times the effect seems gimmicky as the story forces the occurrence of projectiles moving through the air and other times the three dimensional effects hit it just right. When you see the film you will know when the effect works; the mesmerizing visuals are sometimes jaw-dropping, literally.\n\nWriters Tom Farver and Zane Smith keep the pace up throughout &quot;My Bloody Valentine 3-D,&quot; right until the end when it appears that a miner, with grievances will take on a whole town. Right from the beginning the story starts off with a woman on the run from a mysterious figure, behind a breathing mask who seems to delight in wrecking other people&apos;s good time. The start to the movie is explosive and the film does not back down from creating a suspenseful horror flick that is simply out to horrify and be fun. At times the dialogue or introduction of characters into scenes comes off as slightly campy, but the delivery of lines in each scene is generating intensity for the final climactic act.\n\nThe plot of this horror film is somewhat conventional with Tom Hanniger returning to his hometown in order to heal some past misgivings at the hands of a bloody serial killer. &quot;My Bloody Valentine 3-D,&quot; mostly centres on the character of Tom Hanniger, with Sarah and Axel Palmer supporting. Adding enough smaller characters to keep the story complex and creating enough diverging plot lines to keep things tight &quot;My Bloody Valentine 3-D,&quot; does a good job of keeping the killer&apos;s identity mysterious while piquing viewer&apos;s curiosity. Instead of going for a closed box Hollywood ending the film slightly steps it up by leaving the ending open for a sequel. Some of the most successful film franchises come from the horror genre and &quot;My Bloody Valentine 3-D,&quot; might be trying to capitalize on future returns by delivering a plot twist that slightly disappoints.\n\nLighting, environments, and music are all spot on, only the overacting of certain characters distracts from an otherwise excellent horror film. Many of the scenes within &quot;My Bloody Valentine 3-D,&quot; take place in darkly lit mine shafts or the interiors of houses, at night and the overall tone feels like a thriller while showing enough gore to entertain horror fans. The music in the film is subtle enough while picking up the pace slightly during action sequences. On the other hand, the musical score of &quot;My Bloody Valentine 3-D,&quot; could have been much more eerie in order to build up further tension. The acting of Jaimie King comes off as pretentious and somewhat naive while Kerr Smith, appearing to take his role of a small time sheriff a little too seriously displays some awkwardness. The rest of the actors including veterans; Tom Atkins and Kevin Tighe play their smaller parts well; Jensen Ackles, could have taken a darker approach to his character, in order to truly deliver a role of someone who is struggling with the trauma of past brutal events but the portrayal is still good.\n\nOverall &quot;My Bloody Valentine 3-D,&quot; delivers an entertaining ride through dark alleys, mine shafts and the evil minds of writers Todd Farmer and Zane Smith. Slightly on the lighter side of the horror genre this film develops enough jump scares, with the help of three dimensional effects to deliver a fun and fast 101 minutes. See this one with a friend and laugh out loud when a 20&apos; branch comes screaming at your head (and try not to duck)! 6 Mesmerizing Skulls out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Admittedly, I was surprised. This isn&apos;t the type of movie that normally appeals to me, and yet I was really quite taken with it on a number of counts. It could be described as a very gentle movie (even mildly spiritual in some ways) full of sage advice about life and how to handle the disappointments that naturally appear, and - being somewhat stereotypically Italian in its presentation - it has a lot about love and romance and flirtatiousness in it. It even packs a bit of humour. Not a typical guy&apos;s movie, but still very pleasant viewing. What I particularly liked was the premise that essentially started the whole thing off. Frances (in a great performance by Diane Lane) discovers that her husband is having an affair, and they end up divorced - and, she being the primary bread winner - he gets the house and alimony. The lesson? When your life falls apart, move on to something completely different and start picking up the pieces. Frances buys a villa in Tuscany and restarts her life, with us watching. Her problems aren&apos;t solved. She seems to think that everything revolves around finding a man and romance, but - as her friend Martini points out near the end of the movie - she ends up with everything she wanted - just not in the way she expected to get it.\n\nAt times, it&apos;s a bit slow-paced, and it&apos;s not &quot;exciting&quot; in the way we think of the word, but it&apos;s got a quality that draws you into it. As far as the story is concerned, my only quibble might be the introduction of the character of &quot;Ed&quot; right at the end of the movie. Everything to that point had led to the understanding that Frances didn&apos;t need romance to be fulfilled; she had found her fulfillment with the people she had assembled around her, who had become a surrogate family. I suppose it&apos;s nice that she found someone to love, but the movie on the whole would have been more satisfying if it had ended with the gathering at the dinner table with all her friends - without Ed! That was an unsatisfying intrusion into an otherwise satisfying story. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "The &quot;animation&quot; genre now has a common trait: it is known for broader gags, bullet speed pacing, and eye candy visuals, but out of many animation studios out there, Laika Entertainment could be the only one that stays loyal to their own direction. Aside of the stop- motion animation and love to the horror movie camp, their storytelling and themes are equally unconventional, though charmingly daring at best. The Boxtrolls is no different from their last two movies, except this one might be gentler, but the strangeness is still there intact. And by those merit, the experience becomes special.\n\nIt might get immediately be assumed that the film has the same moral of 2012&apos;s ParaNorman. It does have that feeling: strange people being treated as outcasts by everybody and describes their fear to them out of caricatures. But the film tends to explore more messages beneath besides of that, if you can get behind with the whole rescue plan stuff, you may also get to notice that it&apos;s really about separating people&apos;s common views and expectations from the reality; like the Boxtrolls they&apos;re against with aren&apos;t actually bad creatures, or some fathers turn out to be not as supportive as they&apos;re supposed to be, or even the difference between being good and bad. The sentiment may sound a little familiar, but the delivery here is often steady and bitter to acknowledge its sincerity, and it indeed makes it remarkable.\n\nAs for the animation, there&apos;s no hiding for the love of the horror movie aesthetics. The world already looks magnificently whimsical as the filmmakers transcend their stop-motion animating abilities by making grander and crazier set pieces and physical comedy, but when it comes to featuring its creature and character designs, the camp just brings lots of it to life, some parent might find it a little creepy for smaller children, but if they don&apos;t even bother then there is no denying how beautiful they&apos;re designed anyway. In another angle, it offers a larger extent of warmth compared to many family movies today. The nearly wordless montage of the Boxtroll Fish raising young Eggs is one of the sweetest things you would see in recent memory, while the sadder montage at the middle act could surprisingly be affecting. These storytellers just know how to drive emotions. Among the voice actors, Ben Kingsley predictably becomes the best. He brings the main pizazz as both the villain and his hilarious drag disguise. Isaac Hempstead Wright and Elle Fanning are great as well, giving their characters the personalities they need. There are more big names (mentioning the favorites like Simon Pegg and Richard Ayoade) that bring the extra fun of the film.\n\nThe Boxtrolls is probably going to be the least attraction for the animation genre this year, mostly because it&apos;s nearly apart from the comfort zone of today&apos;s entertainment. If you don&apos;t care about trends, then this movie is a treat, and as usual from its studio, the overall film is dark, campy, but visually stunning and eventually endearing. They still haven&apos;t changed and I hope it always stays that way, especially the monster movie tribute and strong heart and perspective towards things. The Boxtrolls proves that these types of animated films shouldn&apos;t be antique yet, there is a huge value to its quality and moviegoers should once again encounter it.",

      "reviewBody": "Oh my Galoshes, there&apos;s a lot to say about this movie. I&apos;ll try to polish over both good &amp; bad, so at times I might sound like I&apos;m Flip Flop-ing. But rest assured my overall experience was positive, and I came out of the theater feeling pretty Pumped.\n\n&quot;The Cobbler&quot; is an entertaining flick that&apos;s good wholesome fun for you, your family and your Keds. My one &amp; only criticism is I don&apos;t think it fully explored the moral lessons it could&apos;ve presented, nor did it delve too deep into the characters. Instead, it deliberately took the route of being a plot driven story, and so it ended up being more of a comedy crime caper than an intimate moral tale. I guess you could say this shoe flick strikes a New Balance between action and heart.\n\nFirst let&apos;s talk briefly about the plot. Adam Sandal-er plays the cobbler Max, a 40-something loser whose life has very little meaning. One day he stumbles on the power to transform himself into any person whose shoes he wears. The story is a clever &amp; original take on the moral lesson: &quot;Don&apos;t judge anyone until you&apos;ve walked a mile in their shoes&quot; (because then you can talk smack about them, and you&apos;re a mile away and you&apos;ve got their shoes). Or something like that.\n\nThe entire production is very well done, and all acting performances were excellent. With a supporting cast of legendary talents like Dustin Hoffman, Steve Buscemi &amp; Ellen Barkin, you&apos;d think &quot;The Cobbler&quot; would be a Shoe-in for movie of the year. But I can&apos;t help but think it missed a great opportunity to explore the aforementioned moral. You&apos;d think this would be a great way to delve into social prejudices as Max learns what it&apos;s like to experience the lives of people of different races, genders and social status. But the film doesn&apos;t touch upon that at all, instead remaining rooted in the story of a man who uses his special power to take on the bad guys. That sort of Suede my opinion against the film.\n\nComedy is sparse &amp; low key but effective. If you&apos;re an Adam Sandler fan, you probably know that he doesn&apos;t always play the wisecracking comedian, but his serious roles are every bit as good if not better (&quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot;, &quot;Funny People&quot;, etc). It&apos;s definitely interesting to see him take on the role of Max. He has a way of giving the character a personal touch so you can really Fila lot of emotion. The character is a man of few words, but we can still learn a lot about him through his fleeting interactions and Converse-ations.\n\nSo there you have it: a mixed review but overall positive; I wanted to give you an idea what to expect if you watch &quot;The Cobbler&quot;. Hopefully Adidas all a favor. This is a nice, breezy movie that&apos;ll entertain you for 99 mins, and it has a nice surprise twist that might make you want to hur-Reebok to the theater and watch it a 2nd time.\n\nAnd as I&apos;m completely out of cheesy shoe puns, I think I&apos;ll end this review. See ya Laces!"

It&apos;s got a fun theme: Wild west, and it is kind of a superhero movie. If you look at the new movie: Cowboys &amp; Aliens, then Jonah Hex looks way better. Also the actors were great. There are quit some famous actors, like Megan Fox, and the roles are also being played very well.\n\nThe special effects I can describe in one word: Awesome. Every special effect is well done, like the huge explosions. Also the clothes and view is very western and good.\n\nThe story is well thought. There is a real storyline, not like there isn&apos;t in some other movies, like scary movie 4.\n\nThe only thing that is a bit of a pity is that the movie is only one hour and nineteen minutes. That is really short.\n\nSo there for I give the movie as rating: 8"

      "reviewBody": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\n&quot;Poltergeist&quot; (2015) is a poor remake of a good original movie, but it is not the worst flick on it&apos;s own. That said, &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (2015) is kinda nicely acted, although i didn&apos;t buy Sam Rockwell&apos;s performance - he was miscast or maybe he new this is going to be poor movie so acted just for fun, but it is clear that this wasn&apos;t his favorite job to say the least. Kinds did OK job, especially one who played Griffin, and Rosemarie DeWitt&apos;s performance was probably the best in this movie.\n\nAs a horror movie, &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (2015) features tons of clichés, and there aren&apos;t true scary moments, you can see &quot;jump scare&quot; scenes from a mile. What i enjoyed about this movie was not the horror elements, but simply family scenes especially during first hour of this movie, but when so called &quot;horror&quot; starts, movie started to drag and by the end i was watching left time like each 5 min.\n\nOverall, &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (2015) isn&apos;t good, but it isn&apos;t particularly bad. If you loved the original, it is nice for seeing it once just for nostalgia, but if you are looking for a decent horror movie, this isn&apos;t the one.",

It certainly looks gorgeous, but that&apos;s almost regrettable in a film that&apos;s otherwise so utterly, grindingly, gone-to-hell stupid. Awful performances (except by Gabriel Macht as Our Hero, who looks great with his wide earnest eyes and buff physique, and handles the lines about his love for the city with fine, tough conviction), jaw-droppingly overdone dialogue, what seems like hours of totally unnecessary comic material ...man, it&apos;s just dreadful, and a great disappointment to me. If I ever buy the DVD I&apos;ll only watch it with the sound turned off.\n\nPoor Will Eisner must be spinning in his grave tonight.",

I&apos;ve had the misfortune of watching many movies that were either too unrealistic or too westernised which made them lose that special magical Indian touch.\n\nThis movie had that touch. Kareena proved that she can indeed act without over-acting and the chemistry between her and Shaheed was incredible. Shaheed also proved that he can be taken as a serious actor.\n\nI loved the songs and the simplicity of the sets. there were no over-budgeted scenes of Indians living abroad. This movie was all in all Indian in its essence and that&apos;s what made it a big hit.",

DO NOT see this movie and DO NOT believe the advertisements for this movie as those scenes were the best parts of the film. I admit, I laughed during the Napoleon Dynamite skit, but that was probably the only funny scene in the whole film.\n\nThis film is stupid, but not stupid in a funny way. It is stupid in an EXTREMELY boring way. The only (barely) entertaining parts of the movie were in the first 10 minutes. The rest of it was filler as the scriptwriter probably ran out of dumb ideas.\n\nI, along with probably most of the audience, felt like leaving on the spot.

      "reviewBody": "Absolute Power may not be an overly special film but it was the first movie I saw in the cinema after leaving high school. I was certainly not the target audience but it had my attention from the first scene and maintained the suspense for the during of the running time, even if it doesn&apos;t build to much.\n\nClint Eastwood plays Luther Whitney, an expert thief who targets billionaire industrialist Walter Sullivan (grouchy old EG Marshall, in his last theatrical movie) while he is off on vacation. While in the midst of cleaning out the vault the President of the United States (Gene Hackman) enters the room with Sullivan&apos;s wife. Whitney hides in the vault, which has a two-way mirror, and witnesses the President get a little too rough with the woman, which ends in her fighting him off and being murdered by the secret service. The Chief of Staff concocts a plan to cover up the murder not knowing that Whitney is watching the whole thing. As the group leave he escapes, taking a crucial piece of evidence with him.\n\nInitially unsure what to do, Whitney decides to taunt the President, though it&apos;s not clear what his complete plan is or even if he&apos;s just free-forming. If one should fault Absolute Power for any reason it&apos;s that it establishes a lot of plot and potential but never really does anything with it and ends with an anti-climactic cop-out.\n\nWhere it succeeds is with the small cast of characters who really make the dialogue and relationships work. Ed Harris as the confused but dedicated cop investigating the case, Laura Linney as Whitney&apos;s resentful daughter, and the austere Scott Glenn as the self-doubting agent make every scene effortless even when there&apos;s not much happening.\n\nAdapted from (and streamlined and improved in the process) the bloated novel by David Baldacci (I call them &apos;Airport novels&apos; – those 600-page bricks with generic covers featuring nothing but the title and author in giant gold letters in a tacky font) the screenplay makes many changes but they are all for the better. Eastwood&apos;s direction is slow and steady – or &apos;mature&apos;. The pace and framing is the antidote for anyone bored to tears with the nauseating aesthetic of today&apos;s comic-book movies and CGI nightmares.\n\nA curious thing about the beginning of the movie is that Clint Eastwood only has 2 lines of dialogue for the entire 35 minutes. I don&apos;t understand why he didn&apos;t cut them out and remain silent, which would give the film a peculiar edge.",

There are no films like this that are both entertaining and emotional.

      "reviewBody": "The cult of celebrity is brilliantly examined in Andrew Niccol&apos;s `Simone.&apos; Al Pacino plays a washed-up `art film&apos; director who is fed up with the spoiled leading ladies with whom he has to work. After his latest leading lady (Winona Ryder in an excellent performance) walks out before the end of production, Pacino is left with an unreleasable film. He is approached by an adoring fan, a `computer geek&apos; dying from cancer, who offers him a solution to his difficulties. Pacino rejects the offer, but the geek sends him a computer disk containing `Simulation One.&apos; When Pacino activates the disk, up pops a stunningly beautiful female,&apos; who is a programmable simulation. Pacino adds personality ingredients from famous actresses of the past, and, viola, `Simone&apos; is created. \n\nInserting Simone&apos;s image and voice into Ryder&apos;s footage, Pacino completes his film. However, Pacino&apos;s work is overshadowed by his creation. Simone becomes a world famous celebrity, a cult goddess.\n\nCombining the cult celebrity of Garbo, Princess Di, Farrah Fawcett and Pamela Anderson, with maybe a little Britney Spears thrown in, Andrew Niccol has created a sharp satire of hero worship. Lacking an ego, Simone is the projection of everyone&apos;s desires; men want her and women want to be like her. Even more fascinating is Pacino&apos;s revelation that he is jealous of his creation, even when he has no need to be. Niccol  sustains his sharp satire of celebrity until the very end of the movie.\n\nWhere `Simone&apos; stumbles is its flat romance between Pacino and his former wife, Christine Keener. I&apos;m sorry, but for me Keener lacks anything resembling sex appeal. Had this role been given to Kim Basinger, Rita Wilson, Cybil Shepherd, Ellen Barkin or Lauren Hutton, the `younger beauty/aging beauty pathos could have been examined. As it stands, `Simone&apos; lacks the kind of conflict which could have given it real spark. Nonetheless, `Simone&apos; is a fun, funny movie and is definitely worth seeing. I give `Simone&apos; a `7&apos;.",

Owen Wilson was funny and sweet (and looks pretty good naked!) I didn&apos;t recognize the three young boys but they were great in their roles. Owen Wilson and Josh Peck were the only two actors I recognized. But I can see the other three boys being cast in other movies like this. They were believable in their roles (as much as the idea of kid&apos;s hiring bodyguards could be, on par with missing the plane and staying HOME ALONE. I was pleasantly surprised. All of the actors were great and I was surprised at how the time flew. The ending surprised me it wasn&apos;t what I expected at all! I would definitely recommend this movie. Enjoy!",

    "summary": "Reviewers say 'The Watchers' delves into themes of duality, transformation, and folklore, inspired by Slavic mythology and Celtic traditions. The film's atmosphere, set design, and cinematography are lauded for their eerie and tense mood. However, the script, character development, and pacing are criticized for being lacking and predictable. The twist and ending receive mixed reactions, with some finding them surprising and others deeming them poorly executed. Dakota Fanning's performance is noted, though opinions on its effectiveness vary. The adaptation from the novel is often discussed, with many reviewers comparing it unfavorably to the source material. Overall, 'The Watchers' is seen as a mixed bag.",

      "reviewBody": "I went into this film with fairly high expectations, intrigued by the trailers and the interesting concept. I recognized only one actor, Georgina Campbell, the lead from &quot;The Barbarian,&quot; a film I quite enjoyed. I was also eager to see how Ishana Shyamalan&apos;s directorial debut would turn out.\n\nTo start, I think the film was very well directed, featuring some really cool and creepy shots that effectively conveyed the story without relying heavily on dialogue. The initial concept of the creatures was interesting; I assume they are based on a real mythical creature, which adds a nice element of realism to the horror genre. However, that&apos;s where the positives end for me.\n\nThe acting felt mediocre. Despite what I&apos;ve seen online, I had no issues with the accents, being from the UK and accustomed to Irish accents. The acting, however, often felt forced, and I didn&apos;t find the relationships or the characters&apos; dread believable. The only scene with commendable acting involved Georgina Campbell.\n\nMy main issue with the film is the twist. Without giving away spoilers, I found it incredibly obvious and poorly thought out. It felt like a placeholder from the first draft, something that should have been replaced with a more refined idea.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s an okay film. Not something I&apos;ll rave about, but if you&apos;re looking for a short horror movie to watch over the weekend, it might be worth a try.",

      "reviewBody": "The 1977 &apos;Pete&apos;s Dragon&apos; was a favourite as a child. As far as by today&apos;s standards, while not a great film and not as good through adult eyes (plus there are better live-action Disney films, especially the timeless &apos;Mary Poppins&apos;), it&apos;s still well worth watching.\n\nDespite having some really talented names on board, expectations were both of great interest but feeling dubious. It did have potential to be better than the 1977 film, and still stand very well on its own, or it could have been a lazy and pointless cash-grab. While it is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, it proved to be a better film than anticipated.\n\nNot one of the best live-action Disney re-imaginings like &apos;Cinderella&apos; and &apos;The Jungle Book&apos; (much better than &apos;Maleficent&apos; though), but still for a re-imagining &apos;Pete&apos;s Dragon&apos; was a good one. It is let down by the final act, where the darker and more action-packed tone jars with what was happening before in the film and at this point the film starts to feel rushed. The villain just felt very shoehorned in and out of place, for the sake of &quot;needing&quot; an &quot;obligatory&quot; villain for conflict (that to me wasn&apos;t necessary), not helped by the hammy performance of Karl Urban that just feels out of kilter with the rest of the cast.\n\nWhere &apos;Pete&apos;s Dragon&apos; especially soars is in the very charming and touching friendship chemistry between Pete and Elliot, essentially the heart of the film. Speaking of Elliot, he is a very lovingly crafted creature with not just beautiful details to him but also with a personality that wins one over in how endearing he is.\n\n&apos;Pete&apos;s Dragon&apos;, apart from some overly grim lighting in places, looks great visually, the splendid scenery being especially good complemented beautifully by cinematography that&apos;s atmospheric and picturesque. The music is lovingly whimsical and fits the film well when it could easily have not done.\n\nScripting serves its purpose well and doesn&apos;t hurt the atmosphere or the central friendship at all, weakening only with the villain and when the film gets darker. David Lowery directs very capably and balances the various elements well. Although it won&apos;t work, and hasn&apos;t worked, for some (with criticisms of it being thin narratively, slow-moving and either too sentimental or cold), for me the story (radically altered with a more sombre tone for example) was immensely charming and appreciated the calmer, straightforward, more gentle and deliberate nature of the story which allowed the friendship to resonate. Never found it mawkish and thought that there was enough emotion without it overshadowing things, though admittedly there is not much that is particularly new.\n\nUrban aside, the acting is good. Oakes Fegley and Oona Laurence are very appealing, while Bryce Dallas Howard is luminous and compassionate and, while not being on screen for long, Robert Redford achieves the right balance of the grizzled and the sympathetic. But essentially it is Elliot and the friendship between him and Pete that carry the film, and, as they should, captivate most strongly.\n\nIn summary, while with its foibles &apos;Pete&apos;s Dragon&apos; was a much more impressive re-imagining than expected after mixed expectations. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

But even today, &apos;Mousehunt&apos; remains as a fun fare, that hasn&apos;t lost its touch.\n\n&apos;Mousehunt&apos; Synopsis: Two stumblebum inheritors are determined to rid their antique house of a mouse who is equally determined to stay where he is.\n\nDon&apos;t ask questions &amp; I can assure you &apos;Mousehunt&apos; will prove to be nothing else but fun. Its twisty plot, coupled with the series of unfortunate events that happen to its protagonists, bring the house down on numerous occasions. Made with heart &amp; joy, this 1997 box-office hit doesn&apos;t run out of gas, despite a few hiccups in its Screenplay. \n\nAdam Rifkin&apos;s Screenplay, despite a few bumps, is a riot overall. Gore Verbinski&apos;s Direction is typically solid. Cinematography is grand. Editing is well-balanced. Art Design is comment-worthy.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Nathan Lane is stupendous, pitching in a genuine comedic performance from start to end. Lee Evans supports Lane, admirably. Christopher Walken is deliciously weird in a bit role. Vicki Lewis is first-rate. \n\nOn the whole, Wanna laugh &amp; relax on a lazy weekend? Watch &apos;Mousehunt&apos;. You won&apos;t be disappointed!",

If it were co keep to the original premise of the E. A. Poe short story with a more suspensfull direction it might have been better. As is, it is a sort of OK, but forgetable film.",

      "name": "An anti-war shag?  In the Loop",
      "reviewBody": "There is something about British comedy that resonates with me. I don&apos;t know if it is because we in the States experience so little of it, or maybe because Hollywood rapes and pillages the material for their own water-downed versions, but the humor just seems fresh, uncensored, and hilarious. When I first came across the new political black comedy In the Loop, I will admit to being less than interested. The marketing materials were using the whole Obama silkscreen poster look and I really wasn&apos;t interested in a movie about how the US and Britain decided to go into the Middle East. But then the buzz started. The realization that the film was shot with a penchant for improv, a desire to entertain rather than teach, and a cast of characters looking as though they are in a Christopher Guest movie, soon turned that preconception around. This is a fantastic film that never lets up on the laughs or one-liners. I just hope people go into it knowing that this isn&apos;t how it actually happened  but then who knows? Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction.\n\nThe back and forth dialogue is so quick that I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes when I read a quote from the director about it all being about 80-85% scripted. He says that he gave the actors leeway to break course and even do takes without scripts at all, but when culling everything together, most of what stuck actually maintained the verbiage laid out by its five screenwriters. Each of these men, including director Armando Iannucci, has been working with British television and all have collaborated on the show &quot;The Thick of It&quot;. I will say now, if I get a chance to check it out, I most certainly will. Political satire is not necessarily my favorite thing in the world—I&apos;ll watch the odd &quot;Daily Show&quot; episode—but after viewing this laugh-riot, checking out a spoof on the British political system, of which I know very little, could be a ton of fun. Heck, just the inclusion of Peter Capaldi will get me to stop surfing when I reach the BBC. This guy steals the show without question.\n\nCapaldi plays Malcolm Turner, a Brit on the frontline of politics as an aide to the Prime Minister, spinning everything and anything to save face. With no time to spare on his running across the Atlantic to put out fires wherever his compatriots start them, you will have to forgive his abrasive, sarcastic, and just plain mean demeanor. The idea of war is being bandied about on talk shows, behind closed-door governmental meetings, and all over the media machine, and it is up to him to keep a lid on it by walking the party line, neither stating a fight is inevitable or unforeseeable—two terms that the buffoon who is British Secretary of State for International Development Simon Foster, played beautifully by the ever capable Tom Hollander, loves to utter. Foster just has to open his mouth to cause a stir felt around the world, and each time, of course, Malcolm Turner is there to chastise and humiliate his stupidity.\n\nThe film ultimately revolves around the journey Hollander&apos;s Foster takes in trying to enhance exposure for himself. Partaking in talk shows or talking out of turn when enlisted to just be &quot;room meat&quot;, some of the Americans begin to see him as someone abroad that shares their sentiment that war is a bad idea. While David Rasche&apos;s Linton Barwick—a hardcore proponent of battle, even using a live grenade as a paperweight—forms secret committees to discuss strategies for war, Mimi Kennedy&apos;s Karen Clarke and James Gandolfini&apos;s Lt. General George Miller are looking for ways to get into that meeting and shut it down. As a result, those two dissenters try to get Foster at every event to awkwardly express his stance of war being unforeseeable, hoping to deter any people on the fence that may be in attendance. So, Malcolm must run back and forth through England and DC spinning things his way and lambasting anyone that gets in his line of fire. Either Foster is too oblivious to care about the verbal assaults thrown his way or he just feels he can blame his Director of Communications Judy, who he makes stay at home while he globe-trots with his new young adviser Toby, (Gina McKee and Chris Addison respectively). Toby and Foster are so similar in their awe of America and lack of experience that their adventures make for good cinema, taking camera phone pics out their limo and speaking about getting hookers for the ride.\n\nIn the Loop is expertly acted and, for the most part, I have to credit that to the intelligent script being utilized. Whether the actors are improvising or not, the original text they are sticking to or springboarding from needed to be strong. By using all the jokes and imbecilic actions we associate with politicians, the writers have crafted a plausible, if not entirely idiotic, account of the days leading up to our countries&apos; joint invasion. Documents are leaked, words are twisted, and supposed partners are stabbed in the back. But through it all we have Capaldi doing his best to keep Britain&apos;s stance as noncommittal as possible. And, truthfully, the way in which he does it makes for what has to be the funniest role of the year. Every word out of his mouth is acerbic and full of double meaning. With the f-word spewing at will and demeaning name-callings going left and right, make sure your head is clear if British speech sometimes troubles you in the comprehension realm. Understanding his words definitely pays off, keeping what would otherwise be a slightly bloated and meandering plot grounded in comedic excellence.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Breach&quot; is slow - slow enough to recommend waiting to rent for most people. It is a good story, but the material requires the methodical pacing that will bore viewers hoping for car chases and gun fights.\n\nThe most authentic part of the movie is its attention to detail. The interior shots look like the drab, boring government offices they portray. This wonderfully realistic touch will be lost on those that haven&apos;t toiled in such holes; it is nice that a movie finally depicts a governmental office that looks like one, instead of a futuristic, gleaming movie version that has more in common with the starship Enterprise.\n\nIntentionally or not, the drabness goes beyond the office spaces (apologies to - yeahhh - Gary Cole). Laura Linney&apos;s hair is flat and dull, and she&apos;s as pale as a ghost. All of the exterior shots are cloudy with a 70% chance of showers, like DC all winter long. The somber look of the movie enhances theme, but will probably leave some viewers with a bad taste.\n\nAs a retired intelligence analyst, I enjoyed this movie because it reminds us that traitors exist, and they cause damage to our national security. Like &quot;United 93&quot; it isn&apos;t easy or enjoyable to watch, but the subject matter is thought provoking.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;IP MAN 3&apos;: Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nMartial arts biopic sequel, to 2008&apos;s &apos;IP MAN&apos; and 2010&apos;s &apos;IP MAN 2&apos;. All three films chronicle the life of legendary grandmaster Yip Man (also known as Ip Man); who is famous for introducing the martial art Wing Chun, to China (and the world). This installment was once again directed by Wilson Yip (who also helmed both other movies); and it was written by Edmond Wong, Tai-Li Chan and Lai-yin Leung (Wong and Chan also co-wrote the first two flicks). Donnie Yen also returns to play the title role (for the third time). The movie also features Jin Zhang, Lynn Hung, Mike Tyson and Kwok-Kwan Chan (as Bruce Lee). Chan also played Lee in the 2008 TV series &apos;THE LEGEND OF BRUCE LEE&apos;, and a 2010 film (of the same name). &apos;IP MAN 3&apos; is definitely not as good as it&apos;s predecessor (which many consider even better than the original film), but it is a fun martial arts flick. \n\nThe story, this time, deals with a ruthless American property developer, named Frank (Tyson); who&apos;s trying to gain control of a Hong Kong school, in 1959, that Ip Man&apos;s son attends. Ip (Yen), of course, comes to the school&apos;s defense. He also must deal with his wife (Hung) becoming ill, with stomach cancer, and a new Wing Chun grandmaster challenger (Zhang). A young martial arts student, named Bruce Lee (Chan), also wants Ip to train him.\n\nThe movie has some pretty impressive martial arts fight scenes; I also especially enjoyed the battle between Donnie Yen and Mike Tyson. Tyson actually makes a good menacing villain; considering he didn&apos;t have to say much (that was a very wise move, of the filmmakers). Other than the action, the movie doesn&apos;t have a lot to offer; I don&apos;t feel like I actually learned much about Ip Man, and the story is kind of a mess. &apos;IP MAN 2&apos; is a much better movie, but this one isn&apos;t bad.\n\nWatch our movie review show &apos;MOVIE TALK&apos; at: https://youtu.be/n2qWxeZ0Tck",

I rented it a few days later, and let me say this is one of the greatest foreign films I have seen.  While the historical and political substance of the film is largely missed by me, the story is strong enough that I connected emotionally with it.  The humor of the film is very refreshing, being used to war films that are too heavy or dull to make me laugh.  I recommend this film to anyone who appreciates a well told story.  You will be rewarded with a beautiful picture."

Then one night when a female friend named &quot;Holly&quot; (Dominik García-Lorido) is brutally raped and beaten he decides to help her get revenge--even though he knows it is going cause him big trouble once everything is said and done. Even worse, this particular problem also spills over onto an innocent client by the name of &quot;Cyrus Kinnick&quot; (Michael Angarano) who has hired Nick in order to avoid trouble. Now, rather than reveal any more I will just say that I happened to like this film because it had a decent plot, nice action and a couple of likable characters who happen to be mired in a dismal situation and are struggling with their own insecurities and inner demons. At least, that is how it seemed to me. In any case, I thought this was an enjoyable film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",

      "reviewBody": "There is nothing better than the original starring Lon Chaney. There is no two ways about it. This film is however outstanding. The plot centers on Will Randall (Nicholson), an aging, past his prime publisher, who is struggling to keep his job as Chief Editor at a publishing house which is being taken over by a wealthy investor name Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer.) His marriage is also on the skids and he is contending with a pompous, brown-nosing, sleazy protégé (Spader) for his future at the publisher. While on a business trip to retain a client on a snowy road in Vermont, Randall hits a wolf and is bitten. After his encounter and assurances from his doctor Randall notices heightened senses and finally gets a hold on what is going on in his life. Along the way he meets a mysterious and interesting woman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and seeks the advice of an alternative healer (Om Puri.) This movie is not terribly scary or really very horrifying, it portrays the wolf as being like mankind, &quot;...evil if the person who is bitten is evil...&quot; And in the dog-eat-dog world of business, really speaks about the urban jungle that is work and business every day. (Who are the real monsters? Werewolves? Or is it the people who wear suits and decide the destinies of people who work in corporate America?) Action comes in at points in small doses and culminates in the end with a final showdown. Overall the makeup was good; it was reminiscent of the classic, and done in the spirit of being an good homage to the original, and thankfully, it didn&apos;t come off as too campy. The dialogue was fair and what little profanity there was didn&apos;t seem necessary. Overall, a good film, I like to watch it from time to time. It will be too slow for viewers who do not appreciate a more dramatic thriller.",

I must confess that I had seen &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;&apos;s Joe Wright (2005) like thousands of times and zombies don&apos;t bother me so why not? well the movie was just Lovely! Seen this girls as a powerful warriors, seen our beloved Lizzie fight it against zombies without fear, with grace and elegance was great! There are some things make me doubt but is refreshing, have some action, some brains and of course Mr. Darcy the personification of charming prince doesn&apos;t disappoint is sexy in his own way.\n\nThe landscapes are beautiful, some great actors around and zombies are OK. It&apos;s not the movie that will change your life but if you are a big fan you&apos;re going to smile you&apos;ll thrill every time Mr. Darcy and Lizzie&apos;s eyes meet and with every interaction. it doesn&apos;t matter if are zombies, plants, aliens or whatever. This is one of the biggest love stories of all times."

      "name": "It could have been just as good as the first",
      "reviewBody": "It was obvious that with the successful release of the Ninja Turtles comics, cartoon TV series and first theatrical release, that another story of the turtles was asking to be told. As told by the released date, it seems that the production of the next installment was already being set up very quickly after the first film. This is OK if everything is thoroughly prepped but most of the time, this isn&apos;t the case. The product becomes rushed and comes out nothing like it&apos;s predecessor. From the trailer it may seem like nothing changed, when in fact there are, and its rather distracting.\n\nThe story takes place after the events of the first movie. So it seems like along with this setting, all the characters should be back too right? Actually, it&apos;s a bit of both. Some require explanations for both the missing and the present. Fans will appreciate that their four turtles still look the same and voiced by the same actors. However, a new actress named Paige Turco has taken over for the role of April O&apos;Neil. Although she fits the look of the character more, she isn&apos;t given much to do this time. Her character hangs more on the sidelines than anything else, than actually helping her turtle friends fight crime. Also, where is Casey Jones? He&apos;s not to be found or even mentioned once throughout the film. Not to mention, the writer behind the screenplay worked on the first movie. How&apos;d he miss that?\n\nAnother issue that comes into question in this installment is the return of The Shredder. In first movie, audiences witnessed him being crushed inside a garbage truck compactor. How in God&apos;s name did he survive that? The continuity is lacking here and it&apos;s very unclear. But the piece of the movie that fans will not appreciate is the fact that for action sequences, the turtles no longer use the weapons they carry. It would be one thing if they didn&apos;t carry them at all, but in every fight they do and they never decide to use them. This particular aspect was something that fans enjoyed about the first one. Why upset the fans? It all comes down to money sad as it is.\n\nWhen it came to other parts of the screenplay, the whole plot behind the &quot;secret&quot; of the ooze, pardon the pun, didn&apos;t contain enough substance to really expand upon anything that wasn&apos;t already known. This is rather disappointing because the setup behind the first made it feel like there was more to be told. Yet when viewers arrive at the sequel, the explanation to this setup feels almost washed over like there wasn&apos;t anything to begin with. With all this said though, there are still a number of redeeming qualities. First and foremost are the turtles themselves. Although they don&apos;t use their designated weapons, they still are fun to watch rolling around, have kicks flying and throwing fists. It seems that even the facial expressions move more fluidly too which is a good thing.\n\nIt&apos;s also nice to see that Splinter is still included in the movie. Even David Warner, better known as Ed Dillinger from Tron (1982) plays a scientist who understands the toxic ooze. And most possibly, the most surprising of them all is seeing Vanilla Ice performing the most nostalgic of all raps, the Ninja Rap. To think that the first movie had music that dated it is now and understatement. With Vanilla Ice chanting his &quot;Go Ninja Go&quot; lyrics, there&apos;s nothing to think except that THIS is the dated movie now. The composer is also the same for this movie and it is understood now that John Du Prez&apos;s themes from the first movie are still kept in tact for this movie as well. At least now, there&apos;s an official theme. Surprisingly, it still entertains with all its issues.\n\nIt still contains fun action sequences and the same turtles but on the whole, the story feels like an empty shell of the first movie. Not to mention, there are a number of things that go unexplained.",

It has everything I want from a thriller: Stellar performances (Willa Fitzgerald freaking killed it), top-notch cinematography, great original scores and sound mixing, simple yet interesting plot, story structure that is similar to Christopher Nolan&apos;s Memento in nature and it subverts my expectations at every turn. Every time you think you know the answer, the movie just does a complete uno reverse; not that it&apos;s that creative, original or unconventional, I just believe Strange Darling is one of those thrillers told in the most memorable, fun and artistic ways, and I assure you it is not easy to please me as an enthusiastic cinephile. It reminds you a lot of Drive 2011.\n\nNothing else to say, go watch it already. One of the most immersive 1 hour and 30 minutes.",

They changed so much of the story that they will be unable to make any of the other books into movies without changing them completely also or remaking this one.\n\nThey totally trivalized the debate between Akasha and her &apos;children&apos;.\n\nMarius (who did not make Lestat btw) in the chronicles is the great reasoner of the Vampires.  In the book he had a long argument for Akasha.  In the movie all he says to her is &quot;Akasha, please&quot;.  He was never jealous of Lestat drinking from Akasha (he himself had many many times) and didn&apos;t try to hide Enkil and Akasha from Lestat. They turned the Vampires from sad and beautiful creatures of the night who only kill the evil-doer into blood hungry wanna-bes who eat whatever mortal wanders by. Maharet&apos;s twin, Mekare, isn&apos;t even in the story.  Mekare crawling out of the jungles after thousands of years, insane and single minded, to fufill the curse she spoke to Akasha in her court in ancient times was a major plot point. Anyway, my point is that a very well thought-out and seductive story was turned into a joke of a movie.  Honestly, don&apos;t bother seeing the movie, read the book."

And, while the sex is mostly served in dialogue-form and not a single shot of nudity is present, there is some graphic lying and some explicit videotape. Kinky, right?\n\nWell, not really. &quot;Sex, Lies and Videotape&quot; is Steven Sodenbergh&apos;s first film and it&apos;s not a bad one. It&apos;s just not entirely worthy of the praise it received, at Cannes for example. The situations in the film do create a fair amount of tension that moves the story along. But then, it&apos;d be hard not to have some tension in a film about a woman whose husband is cheating on her with her sister, while she starts interacting with a stranger who is the husband&apos;s old college roommate and has a strange videotape fetish and may or may not be a pathological liar. (How do you believe someone who just confessed to having been a pathological liar to not being one anymore? The film doesn&apos;t really riddle that one for us.)\n\nClearly, these characters clash together. But it&apos;s not as heated or interesting as it was in later Sodenbergh&apos;s films like the spectacular &quot;Traffic.&quot; The dialogues in &quot;Sex, Lies and Videotape&quot; range from good to incredibly awkward. But the real strength of the film is the actors. While James Spader clearly stands out - I have never seen him deliver such a subtle performance where every scene simply works for him - Andie McDowell is phenomenal, Peter Gallagher playing the scummy, treacherous husband yuppie lawyer type is great and Laura San Giacomo as the vulgar sister / lover is fabulous. Their performances make the script work, which, under normal circumstances with inferior actors would have seemed rather silly.",

      "reviewBody": ". . . considering Halloween 4 came some eight years after the previous Myers-inclusive Halloween, considering Carpenter had even less influence, considering the plot took a slightly different direction, considering most other franchises really suck before they even get to 3 sequels.\n\nThe problem I have with most horror sequels is the fact it switches over to new characters every film, and none of the characters really get much sympathy.  I dunno if I ever cared about anyone in Friday the 13th.  But in the Halloweens (1,2,4,and 5), they&apos;ve always taken the time to get to know the main characters first and stick with them for at least one sequel.  Also in Halloween, we had a staple character besides Myers - Donald Pleasence - who returned to battle Myers every time until his untimely death. \n\n I really liked the Jamie Lloyd character (I mean, getting decent actors in horror is difficult enough, but getting a good child actor in horror?  Look at Child&apos;s Play!  We struck gold with Danielle), her storyline, and the rest of the new characters for Michael to stalk.  Oh yes, and of course, Donald Pleasence.      \n\nAlan Howarth parts with Carpenter, and takes the score solo, playing some fun twists to the main Halloween and the stalking theme, giving Jamie a theme appropriately derivative of Laurie&apos;s theme and intermingling all the themes in various places for an original sound with music that&apos;s been with us for 2 movies now.\n\nHopefully the viewer won&apos;t remember the end of Halloween 2 well enough to recall Laurie shooting Michael&apos;s eyes out, and him stumbling around slicing blindly as blood ran down his mask--wait, this is horror, everyone&apos;s accustomed to inconsistency with horror.  Nevermind.  Besides, compared to the plot holes of Curse of Michael Myers and then H20 neglecting Halloween 4 &amp; 5, who cares about that minor detail.  \n\nDespite the new look, new characters, new tweaks, Halloween 4 can&apos;t escape the fact that it is a sequel slasher and so despite everything that&apos;s new (that works) . . . it&apos;s all the same.  That&apos;s where my problem with the film lay, and that&apos;s why I can&apos;t rank this up there with some of my favorite horror films of all time.  It&apos;s a good Halloween sequel, but there are better, more original films, within this series and especially in other series.  Oh well."

In his more spirited films, Slacker, Dazed and Confused, and now Everybody wants Some; Linklater finds a way to make you enjoy a film that doesn&apos;t necessarily have a plot. In each of those 3 amazing movies he&apos;s directed, the movies just follow the characters as they develop, without a generic or mainstream plot. It&apos;s extremely refreshing to get kind of a lackadaisical, orderless and adaptive type plot.\n\nThe movie follows a bunch of college baseball players who will fully commit and do anything to have a good time. Everything they do becomes a competition between themselves.\n\nIt won&apos;t be everyone&apos;s type of humor, but this movie is hilarious and it&apos;s an easy watch. I highly recommend this movie!

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll get the major cons out of the way first. This movie suffers from the usual problem Hollywood film always seem to have -- no money to afford electricity. Most of the movie is shot entirely in the dark, so goodness knows what happened in those scenes. Also, one or two key bits of dialogue that explain what&apos;s really happening are totally lost to mumbling.\n\nHowever, overall, this film really did improve on second watching. Once you know what the story is, you spot all sorts of little bits of detail that make the whole thing make sense. But more than this, my empathy with Grace, the protagonist and victim, grew exponentially during this second watch. She comes over as an almost wholly sympathetic character. Little things like the carefully wrapped presents she brings and hides make her rather loveable. Her love for her dog and what he represents to her is very moving. She&apos;s a very damaged person, but unfortunately for her, she gets entangled with other very damaged people and hell hath no wrath like grieving children.\n\nThere&apos;s only one jump scare in this movie, but it&apos;s a good one. The rest of the film is a more slow psychological horror about the power of grief and early childhood trauma. And human fragility.\n\nI highly recommend this to anyone who likes their horror thought-provoking and real rather than shock-horror jump scares. This clearly borrows from Hereditary: almost shamelessly copies much of the atmostphere of that film with the dark house, the dolls&apos; house, the cult, the dolls, the camera work inside the dolls&apos; house distorting our perceptions.\n\nPretty good movie with strong performances all round.",

      "name": "Pumpkin men, Weird Al, and a ghost horse; Halloween II is one bizarre movie",
      "reviewBody": "It was quite the dilemma deciding whether Halloween II was a good film or a bad one. One thing is certain: it&apos;s a &quot;weird&quot; film, undoubtedly the most bizarre major studio release of the year. Rob Zombie&apos;s sequel or &quot;vision&quot; – as it&apos;s being touted – seems to have been envisioned with the aid of various hallucinogenics and mind-altering substances, withering away whatever was left of the original John Carpenter Halloween mythology after Rob Zombie&apos;s remake and leaving a nonsensical, uber-violent mess in its wake. This isn&apos;t a so-bad-it&apos;s-good movie, nor would I call it a just-plain-bad one; this is a so-weird-it&apos;s-good movie, a blood-drenched collage of absurdities and irrationality, which like a train wreck (a term some would use to refer to previous Zombie efforts), is hard to look away from. Little of the iconic original Halloween is left here – all that&apos;s left is Michael Meyer&apos;s mask, which itself is less recognizable beneath the grime and torn pieces – but perhaps it would be foolish to try to match the original masterpiece anyway. Zombie has crafted something entirely different; something quite frankly silly, dumb and, for lack of a more politically correct term, &quot;retarded&quot;, but nonetheless entertaining, not in spite of, but because of this.\n\nPicking up where the remake left off, Halloween II sees Laurie Strode recovering from her ordeal with psychopath Michael Meyers. Mentally-traumatized after both the Halloween day massacre of nearly everyone she knew and her own dispatching of Meyers – by way of shot to the head -, Laurie finds herself dreading the one-year anniversary of the serial killings, plagued with the irrational fear that the deceased Meyers will return to small-town Haddonfield to finish her off. Well, low-and-behold, Meyers is alive, and he makes it his mission to track down Laurie and finish what he started.\n\nThe general plot outline is as generic as can be, but it&apos;s hard to fathom or comprehend the insanity that occurs. Michael Meyers, the original mask-wearing soulless psychopath, the &quot;pure evil&quot; murderer, the &quot;Big Cheese&quot; of all horror movie villains, has now been transformed into a homeless vagrant who randomly eats dogs. Yep, that&apos;s right, he&apos;s a hobo that eats dogs now. When a film is remade, one expects some alterations, but this is akin to remaking Indiana Jones and turning him an extraterrestrial who molests children. There is practically no semblance of the original character...and the new ones just messed. As well, Meyer&apos;s is followed by his deceased mother, himself in child-form and a gigantic white horse, seemingly all figments of his imagination. Except they interact with Laurie as well...making them ghosts? Except Meyers isn&apos;t deceased, so it makes absolutely no sense for there to be a ghost version of him. Maybe Laurie is inexplicably psychic and seeing into Meyer&apos;s mind? Or maybe Zombie just ate a few too many shrooms. Either way, this mom-boy-horse trio follows Meyer&apos;s around as he kills various victims, instructing him on what to do next. It&apos;s as stupid as it sounds.\n\nDr. Loomis has also been changed significantly. The remake hinted at Loomis profiteering slightly off the Meyers incident, but here it has been taken to ridiculous proportions. He&apos;s now a prima donna celebrity who travels around in a jet black limo with his publicist, throws hissy fits at reporters and threatens to beat on woman. One sequence has Dr. Loomis appearing on a talk show alongside Weird Al Yankovic, with the famed disc-joker lampooning the doctor and Michael Meyers (making puns about whether this is the same guy who starred in Austin Powers) until Loomis finally explodes with anger on air at the hosts assertion that Meyers is a shark. If it sounds like this has nothing to do with the film, it&apos;s because it doesn&apos;t. This irrelevance not only pertains to the Weird Al scene, but all of Dr. Loomis&apos;s scenes. His entire role is a completely separate, unrelated tangent in which he gallivants around the country promoting his book. For that matter, even Laurie and Michael have about ten minutes in the way of plot. Laurie, up until the last fifteen minutes, never encounters Michael. The near entirety of Halloween II is Michael fighting random people – farmers, strippers, tough-guy scumbags – while Laurie lives her life as per usual.\n\nThe rest of the film is a compilation of pumpkin people, vans running into cows, &quot;golden showers&quot;, discussions about fornicating with corpses, and sex with a guy in a wolf costume who sounded suspiciously like Michael Cera. It&apos;s weird, undoubtedly convoluted, but in the end it&apos;s pretty entertaining. It&apos;s punctuated with displays of head smashings, throat slittings, and other displays of excessively graphic violence. Nudity is slightly down from the first one, but there are still several scenes involving bared breasts. In the end, between all the nonsense, gore and nudity, Halloween II is a big-budgeted, toned-down Hollywood stab at a Troma movie. In other words, a pretty fun movie.\n\nI&apos;m one of the few who actually enjoyed Rob Zombie&apos;s remake of Halloween – a lot. For reasons I won&apos;t get into here I enjoyed it immensely, but at the same time I could completely understand why so many disliked it. It took some of the things that made the original Halloween so great in many people&apos;s eyes and switched them around completely. Those who despised the first Halloween for that reason will likely loathe this second installment with a passion. However, if one can go into Halloween II not expecting a Halloween movie – or even a reasonably scary horror – they might just have a good time. It&apos;s not &quot;bad&quot; per say – although it&apos;s hard to say what Zombie intended it to be – but it&apos;s enjoyable in its bizarreness.

      "reviewBody": "Sinbad the Sailor, probably the greatest anti-hero of the Arabian Knights, has seen many incarnations over the years. This time a new animated film from DreamWorks delves into the myth with some celebrity voices in tow.\n\nSinbad (Brad Pitt) is a happy pirate bent on retiring to Fiji after stealing the legendary Book of Peace. The only problem is that his childhood friend Proteus (Joseph Fiennes) stands in his way. Sinbad finds himself in a conundrum when he fails to obtain the book and ends up following his friend back to his palace where he is introduced to Proteus&apos;s future wife Marina (Catherine Zeta-Jones).\n\nWhen Sinbad is eventually framed by Eris (Michelle Pfeiffer), the Goddess of Chaos for stealing the Book of Peace, Proteus defends his friend for the crime. Proteus puts his life on the line so that Sinbad can sail into uncharted territory and retrieve the book. Unbeknownst to Sinbad, Marina tags along. Can Sinbad wrestle with a goddess and get through uncharted territory in time to save his friend?\n\nSinbad has always been an epic character and one of my favorites from classic literature and myth. He has inspired so many other multi-layered adventure characters over the years. I was first exposed to his adventures when I was a child and obsessed with seeing more movies from legendary creature creator, Ray Harryhausen. The Sinbad trilogy from Harryhausen still has a soft spot in my plethora of movie favorites. I loved the magic and vastness of worlds that inhabited Sinbad as a character.\n\nIt was that knowledge and foundation that made me so excited about seeing a new incarnation of a classic character. I had the same reaction when Disney re-invented `Tarzan&apos; in their animated film. I was half-hoping that there would be a great musical score like that of Disney&apos;s `Tarzan&apos; or `Aladdin&apos; but what I did end up seeing wasn&apos;t your typical animated cartoon. That was a whole new blessing unto itself.\n\nDreamWorks&apos;s Sinbad was definitely a whole re-envisioning of the character but also quite a bold project on its own. I loved how the film seamlessly melded standard animation and computer graphics. There hasn&apos;t been an animated film yet that has been able to make such a successful fusion. The backgrounds were utter eye-candy. I also really enjoyed how smart and delectable the dialogue was between these characters. The humor and drama were very involving and extremely enjoyable. As with every Sinbad movie, you always want to see more far off lands and more creatures. That allure and mystery is alive and well in this version.\n\nWhat was probably the most interesting was that this was the first time an animated film had a character fall in love with his best friend&apos;s future wife or that an executioner is ready with a giant axe to slice off a character&apos;s head. Even some of the tongue-in-cheek humor was more aimed at adults than children. I liked that because it acknowledged that you don&apos;t have to be under 12 years old to enjoy animated films.\n\nMy only wish for Sinbad would be that it had a grander score or a memorable song. I wanted some epic music for such a grand character. A bolder score would have made the animated film feel big enough to encompass what Sinbad is. I liked how DreamWorks used music in both `Spirit&apos; and `Road to El Dorado&apos; but seemed to have dropped the ball for this one.\n\nSinbad is a charming animated film with the DreamWorks edge but it needed to be bolder and bigger to do justice to such a legendary character. I just wanted more. (4 out of 5) So Says the Soothsayer."

First thing I have to say is that I am a man, so this review is done from my point of view. I thought the first movie wasn&apos;t as bad as I was expecting, but to me it was just cheesy and actually pretty much what I expected. I do remember there was enough comedy in it to keep me interested. This movie seemed to play on the women will watch the hell out of this so it doesn&apos;t matter what we do. As far as that thinking goes, it worked. My wife really liked it, but I&apos;m not sure if she liked the movie or just liked watching the movie. This is a movie that is pretty much review proof, either you want to see a movie about male strippers or you don&apos;t. Not much else to say. Overall, not as good as the first one, mainly because this one had no real story. On the other hand I am a guy, not the target audience, and the only reason most women watch is not for the plot.

      "reviewBody": "This was the semantically richest and emotionally deepest film experience I have had in years. And since I am different now that I was five years ago, it could qualify as near my favorite. It will likely not be so for you, at least to approach the way I did. It seems that you have to be my age, and have lived through the events the wrap this. Also, you have to have invested some part of your personal poetry in that of this man. And finally, you have to be sufficiently cineliterate to follow the amazing shape of the eye-concepts that are serially birthed.\n\nOften I say that essentially all films are about other films, rarely reaching life. This does that, reaching life, but by going through, punching through art by force. It presents a collage of images in such a way that we can see through the space in them to truth. Its an amazing feat. But in order for it to work, you have to have those patches sparkle for you.\n\nSo for instance you have to have internalized Fellini&apos;s one masterpiece, and be yearning for decades to escape the now close confines of the imagination set then. Of course when it was new, it was a wild ramble in the jungle, but now turn to tethers in the park. You really have to chafe at what passes for cinematic art, and dream of the next film, the one that will do for us what &quot;8 1/2&quot; did then. \n\nYou also have to have lived through the blasphemy of the Vitenam war and ideally have been on the &quot;right side&quot; throughout and still bear the pain of it. You have to  seriously, even though the director is too young for this  have had your life ruined by the revelation of a lying government, coupled with the spinning parade of false hopes from artists, many of whom we still admire. You have to have built your life taking into account mistrust.\n\nBut you also have to have had this particular dancer as a focus. This man who split into so many men, most of whom were designed to charm, all of whom weren&apos;t men at all but crystallized paths to salvation. You have to have invested in a few of these paths yourself enough so that it cost you more than it ever could Dylan.\n\nIf you have all of these traits then you already have the web on which this tarantula dances. And this will seep into you like some exotic solvent carrying subtle hallucinogens. And it will haunt you forever. Oh, you&apos;ll be able to slough it off and pretend that this is merely a clever puzzle of kinematic trivia. But this will hurt. It will hurt a lot, but only because of memories now defused.\n\nIt will make you soar as well, because it is so massively glorious. Many Dylans, well of course. Different ages, races, sexes. My, surely true.\n\nStories about films of one in another, about hiding from each other, about having sex with and spatting with each other. About disowning, and writing about each other. About one being another&apos;s blood, who is the hidden eyebrow of another in a Joycean web, but one that makes sense because it is made out of the stuff that made us.\n\nWhat impresses me so much is that even before this was conceived the filmmaker had to know something like this fabric of selves existed. And he had to  without having lived it himself  develop deep intuitions about how this specific soul danced upon us in music and images. He had to understand how to borrow and bend those images with the music in ways that would make Julie Taymor blush: &quot;Thin Man&quot; used not for confused sexual tension but the conflating of superficial dylanology with artistic expiration. &quot;Pat Garrett&quot; as the context for a world rather than the escape from one. Over and over again the juxtapositions of life events, image and music (often performed by others in strange deviations) are all wrong but so right.\n\nAnd then this artist had to see it all cinematically, to send it directly into our soul. I suppose this is a particularly broad leap because of the disconnected way this must have been made. \n\nI celebrate this. You might wonder if it worked for someone, somewhere. It sure did for me.\n\nCate understands the whole enterprise, from the outside, all the way through every layer. What a soul!\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this."

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Who among us isn&apos;t intrigued by a real life &quot;unsolved&quot; murder mystery? Throw in a very wealthy New York real estate family, a never-discovered body, an executed friend, and a horrible childhood trauma and it is certain to draw the attention of filmmaker Andrew Jarecki. Jarecki&apos;s film &quot;Capturing the Friedmans&quot; won numerous awards and is among the best documentaries ever made. He has a knack with dark family secrets.\n\nIn the film, Ryan Gosling plays David Marks, disenchanted son of Real Estate mogul Sanford Marks (a powerful Frank Langella), who witnessed the grisly suicide of his mother when he was very young. David meets the energetic and affectionate Katie (Kirsten Dunst) and the two dreamers escape Daddy&apos;s clutches and head to Vermont to open a health food store. Finally wilting under pressure from Sanford, the couple returns to the city and David joins the family business. The good things are soon to end.\n\nSince much of the real life story is still a mystery, Jarecki does a nice job in assembling pieces from the trial records. Along the way, we meet David&apos;s friend Deborah Lehrman (Lilly Rabe), an acclaimed writer who seems to always be there for David ... as he is for her. We witness the transformation of David from loving husband to mentally disturbed murder suspect.\n\nJarecki gives us some guidance on what might have happened and how the plan could have been executed, but we&apos;ll never know for sure. What we do know is that there was not much happiness associated with this family, despite the wealth and 42nd Street real estate holdings.\n\nThe acting in the film is tremendous. Gosling, Dunst and Langella are top notch. Yes, Ms. Dunst provides what is easily her best screen performance ever. Support work from Lily Rabe, Phillip Baker Hall, Nick Offerman and Kristen Wiig is all strong and believable. This one will give you the creeps ... and rightly so.",

      "reviewBody": "Ichi the Killer is definitely not a film for people who have weak stomachs or who are easily offended. This film contains some of the most shocking images you&apos;ll ever see and includes some very disturbing characters that won&apos;t be forgotten in a hurry. It is always a very brave move for a film maker when they decide to adapt from a manga as manga often has aspects within it that can not be replicated in to a live picture. Takashi Miike makes the transition possible and blows away all walls of reality with an outstanding and totally unforgettable film.\n\nThe plot involves Yakuza boss Anjo going missing with a huge stash of cash, his gang members investigate and a classic game of cat and mouse is involved. This seems simple enough but what is out of the ordinary is that the leader of the investigation, Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano), is a major masochist and Anjo&apos;s killer, Ichi (Nao Omori) is the ultimate sadist with a tormented soul. This is where Ichi the Killer&apos;s shocking and graphic imagery really come in to force. Miike is uncompromising in his approach with regards to what he delivers on screen. There are no subtleties, no off camera goings on; it is all there for the audience to see, in full detail! The torture scenes, and their results, are especially horrific. If this film had been made in America or Europe, it would have been banned within a second of being made, it&apos;s that graphic. What disturbed me more than the disgusting imagery however, were the characters. Ichi&apos;s character I found genuinely terrifying as whilst he often comes across as a cartoonish character, there is a disturbingly real quality to his character. Ichi&apos;s childlike naivety draws many parallels to past psychotic killers that have existed in real life and his sexual excitement at causing pain and death is incredibly unsettling. Also unsettling is the character of Kakihara. His badly scarred face and clips either side of his lips immediately make him appear a scary figure and the only thing more disturbing than his pleasure for torturing others and watching their pain is his unparalleled love for being beaten and tortured himself.\n\nWhat I like about many Asian films is that the acting is often very good and Ichi the Killer is no exception. Tadanobu Asano is brilliant as Kakihara. His performance is charismatic and terrifying, he does a great job of making the role his own. Nao Omori plays Ichi perfectly. The way that he can act tormented, childish and merciless all in one scene is incredible to watch and, as I said before, gives the film a genuinely disturbing edge rather than just immense gore. Alien Sun is very sexy as Karen and the way she speaks more than one language in an almost random fashion adds further mystery to this film. The fact that Karen is the only character who has Ichi&apos;s past explained to her from Jijii makes the audience able to empathise with her character more than anyone else. Shinya Tsukamoto is also very good as Jijii. His character is unravelled throughout the film and Tsukamoto is very convincing in his portrayal of what turns out to be a very complex character.\n\nThe purpose of this film is to shock and it achieves its goal to the point where you almost can not watch. With extremely graphic gore and some intense surrealist imagery that Salvador Dali himself would have been proud of, Ichi the Killer will never be forgotten and deserves to be watched by a lot more people (even if they can only watch it once!). Miike is very clever with his direction. The way he blends Kaneko&apos;s flash back sequences with the present does wonders to keep the audience&apos;s attention. The ending is also done with great style and is very effective in ending the film so it is down to interpretation of the audience.\n\nDespite being very hard to palate, Ichi the Killer is a fantastic film. Directing, acting, writing and score are all spot on and the quality of the film is very good. Not a film I could handle watching too regularly but definitely a film I&apos;ll want to watch a few more times in the future.",

      "reviewBody": "They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery - When the Last Man standing first came out, it was hard not to make the connection between that film and Yojimbo (since Yojimbo&apos;s script was credited -although not the original source for Yojimbo, an American crime novel, red Harvest, by Dashiell Hammet - Yojimbo&apos;s Kurosawa also forgot to credit in his film). But even a critic as astute as Roger Ebert only thought the film was only &apos;similar&apos; to &quot;Fistful of Dollars&quot; even though the plots of the two films have more in common than that of this film and Yojimbo.\n\nSince then, I have watched all the films several times. Now is as good a time as any to reflect on the matter again. \n\nThe Last Man Standing does not hold up as well as I had hoped; the saturated sepia tones of the film now appear to be a mannerist affectation. It was certainly a transitional film for Willis - the role is pretty heavy - but the Sixth Sense rewrote the book on Willis far better than any of his other off-cast roles could, since (unlike the others) it never made any pretense at being an action film. The voice over is a little pretentious. And its clear that Hill let the Gothic tone of the film overwhelm his efforts at black comedy. And oddly enough, despite its violence the film could use more action.\n\nYet the film remains historically important, if nothing else, because it now appears to have been the last of a cycle. Although even Jean-Claude Van Damme actually appeared in a &quot;Yojumbo&quot; clone - &quot;Desert Heat&quot; - and there have been other attempts to revive Hammett&apos;s essential narrative (e.g. the &quot;Doom&quot; robot film by Albert Pyun) the fact remains that the nameless outsider quick on the draw is fast slipping into the realm of pure 20th century myth. He doesn&apos;t really belong in the era of Computer graphics, invasions of Iraq, wars against non-existent terrorism. His blood is part whiskey, but it&apos;s human blood; and he may be a killer, but he won&apos;t be a party to genocide. He&apos;s too real, and yet too good, for the 21st century rushing in on us.\n\nI take the darkly sepia-toned Last Man Standing as a final farewell to a hero of the previous century, just as Hitchcock&apos;s 39 Steps effectively said farewell to the romantic adventurer of the 19th century. Every era has its heroes; and it is sad that Sanjuro/John Smith/the Man with No Name can no longer be one of ours. It&apos;s probably too much to ask, but hopefully someone better - or at least as good - will come along. \n\n-E. J. Winner.",

      "reviewBody": "This is unfairly forgotten sports comedy . It&apos;s far better than the more famous and overrated &quot;Major league&quot;. I&apos;m not exactly a fan of sport comedies , but this one is one of the best I&apos;ve seen.\n\nThe movie really heavily on the trio of stars : Kevin Costner (&quot;Dancing with the wolves&quot;) , Susan Sarandon (&quot;Dead man walking&quot;) and Tim Robbins (&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;). Each of them shines here. Costner is charming and very likable as the smart and bitter old baseball player. Sarandon is incredibly funny as the woman obsessed with baseball and sex . Robbins is very convincing as the incredibly talented , but stuck up young baseball player.\n\nI like that this movie doesn&apos;t follow a typical &quot;from zero to hero&quot; story that is so often (TOO often) seen in this type of movies. Instead we got here a story about love triangle between two baseball players and baseball fan . The movie is a character comedy and it&apos;s fun to see how the characters interact with each other and change during the movie. There is great chemistry between them.\n\nI love the wisecracks from Costner&apos;s mouth , Sarandon is HOT and Robbins is adorable when he throws into the bull.\n\nThere is some great music here . Soundtrack is full of great songs like: Bill Haley and The Comets &quot;Rock around the clock&quot; , Edith Piaf &quot;Non , je ne regrette rien&quot; and &quot;La vie en rose&quot; , Ike and Tina Turner &quot;I idolize you&quot; , The Everly brothers &quot;When I will be loved&quot; , Los lobos &quot;I got loaded&quot; and Joe Cocker &quot;Woman loves a man&quot;.\n\nThe only thing that I didn&apos;t like is the religious approach to the baseball. I&apos;m not a fan of baseball and I couldn&apos;t really relate to it, but the baseball fans probably will be happy.\n\nA very pleasant , charming and enjoyable comedy. Good way to spend your time. I give it 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Aaron Sorkin sets a snappy pace for this classic romance/comedy/Cinderella Story, utilizing the White House, the President, and his staff as the conduit for his dialogue writing prowess.\n\nClearly, this film helped influence the creation of &apos;The West Wing&apos; TV Series four years later, even using the same Oval Office set shown in this film. The sets and atmosphere are presented in immaculate detail, and authentic looking, surpassing anything ever portrayed in film other than the Whitehouse itself. I&apos;ve been in the real Whitehouse, including the Oval Office, and have also sat at the faux Resolute desk on the set of West Wing (same desk used in this film). There was a tremendous investment made to recreate the real thing in this film, and Reiner pulled it off perfectly.\n\nIn Sorkin&apos;s screenplays, self-confidence, keen intellect, superior communication ability, and one&apos;s ethics-compass are at the core of the protagonist&apos;s persona.\n\nMichael Douglas portrays Democratic President Andrew Shepherd with the same believability and deft touch as he did playing Gordon Gecko in Wall Street.\n\nAnnette Benning is the ideal girlfriend of the widowed Shepherd, and engages the audience (and Douglas) in one of her most charming performances.\n\nA first-class supporting actor ensemble are up to the task of portraying Sorkin&apos;s crack White House staff, adding immensely to making this film a feel-good romance that is believable and fun.\n\nThe plot doesn&apos;t delve deeply into the emotions or feelings of Shepard nor Benning&apos;s lobbyist charecter Sydney Ellen Wade, but highlights the witty repertoire one would expect from a US President and Capitol Hill lobbyist. The deft skill and movie-star quality each actor has developed in their respective acting careers are showcased with Sorkin&apos;s writing in telling this Whitehouse Cinderella story.\n\nIf the film went deep into emotions, it would have just gotten in the way of a story of a widowed relatively young President falling in love at first sight with Sydney, and the fun of seeing her being thrust into the White House staff and press fish bowl.\n\nThere is a definite Frank Capra influence to the film.\n\nIt all works better than it might seem on paper, and we get to enjoy another Rob Reiner classic: A director whose movie-making style and subject-matter is as diverse as anyone in the business.",

      "reviewBody": "The highly anticipated Pushpa 2, the second installment in the Pushpa franchise, delivers a mass-market spectacle but falls short in certain areas.\n\n1. Content: While the movie is crafted for mass appeal, the storyline could have been more refined and engaging.\n\n2. Action Design: The fight sequences and chases resemble a video game, which might work for some but feels over-stylized.\n\n3. High-Voltage Moments: There are predictable, high-energy sequences that generate excitement but lack depth in terms of narrative integration.\n\n4. Plot Development: The movie consists of several whistle-worthy moments, but these individual blocks lack cohesion and fail to develop into a compelling plot.\n\n5. Entertainment Value: Pushpa 2 is positioned as a &quot;paisa vasool&quot; mass entertainer but falters with two weaker songs.\n\n6. Performances: Rashmika Mandanna delivers a solid performance.\n\n7. Character Intensity: Fahadh Faasil&apos;s character lacks the seriousness or intensity seen in the first part, making his role less impactful than anticipated.\n\n8. Villain Arc: The absence of a strong antagonist makes the hero&apos;s victories feel one-sided, with the actual conflict seemingly reserved for Pushpa 3.\n\n9. Dialogues: The one-liners and punchlines are effective and add to the entertainment quotient.\n\n10. Characterization of Pushpa: Allu Arjun&apos;s characterization remains strong but doesn&apos;t offer anything new. The decision to save key scenes for Pushpa 3 dilutes the impact of this sequel, leaving room for fillers instead of substantive content.\n\n11. Overall Appeal: While the film is a mass-market hit and delivers on entertainment, it might leave discerning audiences, including those paying premium prices for tickets under government-supported initiatives in India, wanting more in terms of content quality and storytelling.\n\nIn conclusion, Pushpa 2 is a high-energy, crowd-pleasing entertainer but lacks the narrative strength and depth that could have made it truly exceptional.",

      "name": "Flashdance clearly provides what many viewers want",
      "reviewBody": "There are already many comments on this film in the IMDb database, and I had no intention of writing another until to my surprise I noticed that it was frequently being replayed on several different local TV channels. Flashdance is a very outdated movie that has never appealed to most film critics, so I felt this was sufficiently unusual to justify an attempted explanation.\n\n\tSince the DVD of Flashdance was released, it has appeared for hire in many small local convenience stores and service stations that only maintain a very small rack of films for hire Clearly although it is now very much of a period movie, it continues to retain an enormous appeal for many of those who have seen it before. Personally I have watched our tape of Flashdance more often than most of the other tapes we have at home. This is not because it would be my first choice, but because it is a film that my wife loves to watch again and again; whilst I find I can view it repeatedly more readily than many of her other favorite tapes, so when we are discussing what to view and have rejected a number of other possibilities we tend to turn back to Flashdance. This reinforces the comments already made in your database about Flashdance being a &quot;feel good&quot; movie for which most people seem able to ignore the faults and just enjoy the music, the dancing and the romance. (It also features &quot;Grunt&quot;, a very appealing dog, who remains one of the reasons why my wife is always ready to rewatch this film.) As a film Flashdance is therefore something of a paradox. Originally the final product was not very highly regarded by the studio and only received a limited release. This was severely panned by most of the critics, and  not surprisingly the film initially received very little support from the public. The reviews and the low attendance led to plans to withdraw it from circulation early, but before these were implemented the audiences started to grow and continued to increase until cinemas showing the film were mostly packed out. Clearly those few who saw the film at an early showing started telling their friends to ignore the critics and see it. This escalated exponentially until the film finished up as a major hit. In commenting on this film it would be equally invalid to ignore the very real concerns of the critics or the equally real appeal it had, and still seems to have, for most of the public.\n\n\tThe story is trite - a female welder in a steelworks dreams of being a ballet dancer and practices her dancing in one of the local bars at night. Here she meets and starts to fall in love with her fairly young divorced boss. With his support she is able obtain an audition with a major dance company who are essentially only interested in her dance training, and lose any interest they may have had when she says she has never attended a dance school. However she proceeds to audition for the very bored selection committee and gives an electrifying free dance performance that in true fairy story tradition brings the committee to its feet. Some critics have complained that doubles replaced the star Jennifer Beals for this sequence, but this is surely not important - the real question is how effectively the film plays, and this sequence has rightly been very widely admired. About the time the film was released, modern dance companies were being formed alongside traditional ballet companies in many major cities in North America and this sequence certainly added to the appeal of the film at the time, but it is decidedly not the only reason for watching it.\n\n\t\tI could spend pages criticizing the screenplay in several different respects, but other comments in your database have already done this, and these criticisms are ultimately not damming. The important thing is that the film maintains an ongoing flow which sweeps most viewers along and earns it a place as one of the finer musical comedies to have been released in the past quarter century. The object of a film is to entertain the public and in ranking Flashdance I feel I must base my rating on its undeniable success in doing just this. So 7 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Child&apos;s Play 2 picks up not long after where its infamous predecessor left off, and straight into the film, the original Good Guy doll housing the spirit of the Lakeshore Strangler is being fixed up and Good Guys are back in action. While unfortunately, Chris Sarandon and Catherine Hicks do not return, they are at least mentioned, and given plausible reasons as to why they could not be in the movie. Innocent Andt Barclay (Alex Vincent) however returns, and is once again at the mercy of Chucky (voiced by the classic Brad Douriff) when Chucky traces Andy down to where he is living in foster care. From there, the typical mayhem follows, with plenty of doll-style murders, witty lines from Chucky and a great finale at the Good Guy doll factory.\n\nWhile the original Child&apos;s Play is a terrifying classic, part 2 is somewhat of a step down, only because one knows what to expect, for the most part. However, the cast are a great asset to the film. Alex Vincent is right on the mark in his role as Andy, Christine Elise is terrific as his foster sister Kyle, and Jenny Agutter adds a touch of class as their foster mother Joanne Simpson. Gerrit Graham plays her strict husband, and Grace Zabriskie is good in her role as the career at the orphanage. Beth Grant steals the moment in her small role as Mrs Kettlewell however. Overall, a fun sequel to the original, with a well rounded cast and plenty of thrills to keep one entertained.",

      "reviewBody": "In the beautiful British town of Stratford-Upon-Avon there&apos;s a street where the owners of two neighbouring houses have no idea of the rich lives being led in their backyards. In these backyards there are two groups of garden gnomes - one garden is ruled by the blue hatted variety, the other is ruled by the red hatted variety. An age old feud - of which the reason has long since been forgotten - is keeping them apart, but unexpected events might just be enough to get them back together again.\n\nLoosely based on the Shakespearean tragedy Romeo And Juliet this animation film keeps the middle line between tragicomedy and romance. Like many animation films being made these last years it combines fun things for kids with fun things for adults - without hurting either group (the innuendo that is fun for adults is not seen by kids whose innocence protects them from it, the deviation from the original tales to make it fun for kids is not so warped that it makes it unrecognisable for them parents).\n\nThe animation is great - the gnomes and the gardens are just lovely to watch. The setting with gnomes is flawless - the sounds, the implications of being a garden gnome - it works out really well.\n\nIf there would be one bit of negativity for this film it is that its trailer is a bit too biased towards an audience that wants to see romance instead of a bit of light comedy.\n\n8 out of 10 midsummer night&apos;s dreams",

The envy of the neighbourhood, his bike is his life and he is horrified when he finds it stolen.  With the police unwilling to start a statewide search, Pee-wee sets out on an adventure to try and find his bike.\n\nPee-Wee Herman is a fairly acquired taste and won&apos;t please all audiences.  I quite liked him here but couldn&apos;t have watched his show on a weekly basis. In this film though his `man-child&apos; style and outlandish sense of humour really work out well.  The plot is fairly pointless and just sparks off a road trip, which has a series of bizarre characters and adventures along the way.\n\nTim Burton&apos;s darkly comic imagination certainly helps and he gives the whole film an other-worldly feel to the whole thing, whether it be in the delivery of Herman&apos;s dreams or just the look of the film as a whole.  Not all of it works of course, some of it misfires and isn&apos;t as funny as it would like to think that it is, however much of it is weirdly amusing and will be entertaining if you like Herman&apos;s style.\n\nHerman can be annoying but here he stays on the right side of irritating and he is amusing in his delivery.  He certainly suits the material and his OTT/hyper style helps the audience get into the very silly plot!  Support is good and has lots of small roles that are weird and funny.\n\nOverall this film is very much a matter of taste.  If you like Herman then you should enjoy this film as it is very well done and is blessed with a real other-worldly touch by a great director in the making."

      "reviewBody": "Thoughtful and thought-provoking war-drama based on the memoirs of N.Y. Times correspondent named Sidney (Sam Waterston) and his relationship to journalist assistant and guide named Pran (Haing S Ngor ) . Extraordinary feature debut for Ngor who won Best Supporting Actor Academy Award . Haing S. Ngor a real-life doctor who had never acted before and who lived through the deeds depicted at the movie , he became the first Southeast Asian , and the first Buddhist , to win an Oscar ; furthermore also first film for John Malkovich who gives an awesome portrayal as an intrepid photographer . Ngor&apos;s own experiences (in real life he lived Cambodian war ) echoed those of his character and usually played Vietnam roles (Tortures of war, Heaven and Earth , In love and war , Vietnam Texas , Eastern condor) until his violent death by an Asian band . This exciting story depicts the war chaos , Cambodian turmoil and primal bloodletting , but most of the movie is a shattering re-creation of hell on Earth . Marvellous cinematography by Chris Menges who also deservedly won Academy Award and filmed in Phuket , Railway Hotel , Hua Hin, Thailand and Royal York Hotel , Toronto, Ontario, Canada . Screeching and sensitive musical score by Mike Oldfield that accompanies perfectly to the film . Roland Joffe&apos;s direction shows a generally sure-hand with a bit of melodrama at the end . Alain Resnais&apos;s seminal documentary ¨Nuit et Brouillard (1955)¨ was a touch-point for both director Roland Joffé and prestigious producer David Puttnam when they were preparing this magnificent movie .\n\nThis excellent movie contains a relentless criticism to Pol Pot regime , but also US and an exact description about historic events . In power , the Khmer Rouge carried out a radical program that included isolating the country from foreign influence, closing schools, hospitals and factories, abolishing banking, finance and currency, outlawing all religions, confiscating all private property and relocating people from urban areas to collective farms where forced labor was widespread. The purpose of this policy was to turn Cambodians into &quot;Old People&quot; through agricultural labor. These actions resulted in massive deaths through executions, work exhaustion, illness, and starvation. In Phnom Penh and other cities, the Khmer Rouge told residents that they would be moved only about &quot;two or three kilometers&quot; outside the city and would return in &quot;two or three days.&quot; Some witnesses say they were told that the evacuation was because of the &quot;threat of American bombing&quot; and that they did not have to lock their houses since the Khmer Rouge would &quot;take care of everything&quot; until they returned.Money was abolished, books were burned, teachers, merchants, and almost the entire intellectual elite of the country were murdered, to make the agricultural communism, as Pol Pot envisioned it, a reality. The planned relocation to the countryside resulted in the complete halt of almost all economic activity: even schools and hospitals were closed, as well as banks, and industrial and service companies.During their four years in power, the Khmer Rouge overworked and starved the population, at the same time executing selected groups who had the potential to undermine the new state (including intellectuals or even those that had stereotypical signs of learning, such as glasses) and killing many others for even breaching minor rules . The Khmer Rouge forced people to work for 12 hours non-stop, without adequate rest or food. They did not believe in western medicine but instead favoured traditional peasant medicine; many died as a result. Family relationships not sanctioned by the state were also banned, and family members could be put to death for communicating with each other. In any case, family members were often relocated to different parts of the country with all postal and telephone services abolished. They committed crimes against humanity , the Khmer Rouge government arrested, tortured and eventually executed anyone suspected of belonging to several categories of supposed &quot;enemies&quot;. Today, examples of the torture methods used by the Khmer Rouge can be seen at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. The museum occupies the former grounds of a high school turned prison camp that was operated by Khang Khek Ieu, more commonly known as &quot;Comrade Duch&quot;. Some 17,000 people passed through this centre before they were taken to sites (also known as The Killing Fields), outside Phnom Penh where most were executed (mainly by pickaxes to save bullets) and buried in mass graves . Of the thousands who entered the Tuol Sleng Centre (also known as S-21), only twelve are known to have survived.",

He loves the ladies and he loves speeding on his vintage Indian Scout &quot;modified somewhat&quot; along the open beach of Invercargill in Southern New Zealand. Beach bike racers still contest the Burt Munro Trophy on Oreti beach.\n\nBurt&apos;s 1967 record at Bonneville still stands. \n\nAnthony Hopkins manages the problematic Kiwi accent well to deliver a touching, funny and realistic depiction of Burt in his quest to be the fastest thing on two wheels. Sir Anthony said that it&apos;s the best thing he&apos;s ever done and it&apos;s hard to disagree based on his laconic and lovable portrayal.\n\nOutstanding cameos by the likes of Annie Whittle and Diane Ladd simply add depth and verisimilitude to the film. Tim Shadbolt, well he definitely acted in the film...\n\nComplete and convincing performances that warm the heart and show true humanity shining through. \n\nThe cinematography is clear and precise, the action scenes are mercifully free of special effects and Burt&apos;s kiwi innovation and guile win the day. \n\nA new classic from Roger Donaldson.",

      "name": "Better than it has any right to be, this revisionist spin on the classic Mary Shelley creation finds its heart in the men behind the monster",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;You know this story. A crack of lightning. A mad genius. An unholy creation,&quot; intones Daniel Radcliffe&apos;s Igor Strausman, who warns us at the start not to expect a literal re-telling of Mary Shelley&apos;s beloved horror classic. Instead, as imagined by writer Max Landis, this latest spin focuses on the relationship between the titular mad genius – played by James McAvoy – and his trusty associate Igor who becomes instrumental to his dream of re-animating the dead. Yes, though Victor first meets Igor as a nameless hunchback at the circus, the latter is in fact a gifted physician whose knowledge of the human anatomy makes him invaluable to Victor&apos;s plan of assembling various organs into an outer shell and introducing life into it.\n\nBut even before that, Victor recognises something special in the filthy clown with the rat&apos;s nest of a hair who rushes to the aid of a trapeze artist Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay) following a near- fatal fall during a show and manipulates her bones in order to save her life. So Victor decides to give the destitute sad-sack a new lease of life by first busting him out of the circus, where at his cavernous home cum laboratory, he proceeds to drain the fluid from the young man&apos;s massive abscess, fit him with a back brace, and give him the name of his absent flatmate Igor whom Victor says is a morphine addict who has not been seen for months. Igor is indebted to Victor, and so without much question, assists his &apos;saviour&apos; in his experiment to bring life to a homunculus stitched from animal- part discards from the local zoo.\n\nIf you&apos;re waiting for the iconic hulking man-monster to appear, let us warn you that you&apos;ll have to wait until the very finale, which takes place on a very stormy evening in a remote Scottish castle right next to the sea. Indeed, this is less a movie about Victor actually creating his monster and what happens afterward than about the process leading up to that pivotal moment, which its director Paul McGuigan centres on a debate between theology and technology as well as an emotional complement in the bond between Victor and Igor. To introduce the former into the narrative, McGuigan interrupts the scientific proceedings with the entry of a moralistic Scotland Yard detective (Andrew Scott), whose past has not only made him a man of unwavering faith but also obsessed with stopping Victor&apos;s experiments he perceives as Satanic.\n\nIt is also this said inspector who causes Igor to question Victor&apos;s research, especially in the wake of Victor&apos;s Royal College of Medicine presentation of his first hodgepodge Prometheus which unsurprisingly does not end well. Not unsurprising too is how Victor is constructed as both the emotional and moral centre of the film – though he starts off subservient to Victor, Igor struggles with the ethical implications of using science to achieve immortality, which ultimately leaves him conflicted with the dilemma of sticking by the person who had rescued him from eternal ignominy or following his own conscience. Igor also finds his heart with Lorelei, who makes a somewhat amazing recovery to help Igor find his centre of being.\n\nThough the romance is contrived, McAvoy and Radcliffe are actors with charm and gravitas, and they make good use of both qualities to keep us engaged in their bromance. McAvoy overdoes the mad-genius bit on more than one occasion, but is on the whole appropriately brash and obsessed to play the brilliant, extroverted yet socially bizarre Victor. At least Radcliffe complements his partner with a nicely understated performance, which expresses his character&apos;s anguished, good-hearted and conflicted nature at various points. Next to Victor, Igor is a much more straightforward persona, but Radcliffe does what he can to make us empathise with the latter&apos;s plight.\n\nOn his part, McGuigan keeps a tight balance between horror, drama, romance and even a few spots of comedy, while ensuring that the pace doesn&apos;t sag. No stranger to Victorian-era London from directing several episodes of &apos;Sherlock&apos;, he forgoes more handsome evocations for a more grimy and downbeat vision of 19th-century London that is more befitting of the grotesqueness of Victor&apos;s creations. Oh yes, despite the rating, you&apos;d do well to note that some images are absolutely not for the squeamish, in particular because the film does not shy away from displaying the various organs of the body which Victor uses to assemble his unhuman work of science.\n\nAs an origin story, you could do much, much worse than &apos;Victor Frankenstein&apos;, which is loud and messy all right, but has a quieter, more grounded centre on its arguments of faith versus science as well as a compelling relationship between its two lead characters. That&apos;s provided of course that you&apos;re willing to accept a revisionist take in the first place, with Frankenstein played as a soulless hulk that is prone to violence but nothing more and relegated almost to an afterthought right at the end. Like we said, this isn&apos;t about the monster as we typically know it, but the journey leading up to its creation, one that is undeniably intriguing in itself.",

Many appreciate the film's focus on the Warrens' family dynamics and the closure it provides to the franchise. However, criticisms abound regarding the film's reliance on jump scares, lack of originality, and failure to match the intensity of earlier entries. Some reviewers feel the horror elements are underwhelming and the story is predictable. Despite these criticisms, the film is seen as a fitting, if not spectacular, conclusion to the series.",

      "reviewBody": "First off, the based on a true story tagline is like that one friend who tells you that he met a extremely good looking girl and that she was extremely down for him the whole night, but in reality, these two just had a coffee and talked about the economy or smth the whole night, maybe she slightly striped her feet upon his knee or something but... that&apos;s it.\n\nThese film are overly-exaggerated pieces of HALFWAY real events, and I don&apos;t mean that by scenario or concept, I also mean that by performance and cinematography. When you look at a film like The Exorcist from 1973, it roughly cuts fast, it is very slow paced for today&apos;s standards, the camera holds itself long, not many effects or anything, the whole horror is made by build-up and performances... it&apos;s the simple things. Lightning and Sound-Design are top tier and makes you feel unease. Here, we have so much of it, and it still feels flat. Why? Because they don&apos;t know how to CREATE and USE tension. It is a tool to boost emotional development of the characters. It is also a tool to increase our feeling of unease for example. And to anyone who says, The Exorcist was the first film and is hella old, they can&apos;t just redo that all the time, you don&apos;t get the point.\n\nVeronica, a Spanish horror film, made in I believe 2013, falls into this category of great reality-inspired horror. It is terrifying because it doesn&apos;t hold or loses its tension, it does neither of that. It just FLYS by, and what we care for, is her psychological well-being and the survival of his brother. We gotta care, and know that THESE characters aren&apos;t safe, these films don&apos;t play anymore with psychological fears of the human mind that are deeply rooted in our nature. Recently I watched and film from France, Spoorlos, or The Vanishing. Without context, there&apos;s a scene where a character lies in an tomb alive. That was scary and made me feel uneasy, it made me sick for minutes. Same with claustrophobic environments, they just want to scare us with LOUDNESS and unexpected things. And that is the main problem.\n\nThere are a few scenes where that feeling gets transported, for example when someone looks around and see&apos;s a demon in silent darkness, or when someone suddenly starts to throw up glass and blood, these scenes are great, especially the second one catched me, but that is made by the performances of her and everyone standing beside her.\n\nConjuring&apos;s Final isn&apos;t bad by any means, but It is so exaggerated in its simplicity of that makes sense. It&apos;s not bigger, it&apos;s not more intense, it&apos;s just overly-more exaggerated in the way it pays-off its scenario. The actual characters, especially the Main Cast, they deliver well and the chemistry of Lorraine and Ed is again what makes this film halfway good. I just think they&apos;re chemistry and love is perfect and felt through every scene of these films, especially in this one.\n\nI enjoy it for what It is, but looking back, the first Conjuring was something that still gave you shivers weeks after watching only by thinking about it...",

      "reviewBody": "Whilst Emma Stone puts down her marker for a possible third Oscar nomination the film as a whole left me slightly cold.  But then, when did you last see a GREAT tennis movie.  That&apos;s right.  You didn&apos;t.\n\nBut this potentially offered more because it appeared multi layered and could have been more nuanced than it is.\n\nIt tackles two themes simultaneously.  First, Billie Jean King&apos;s lesbian relationship with her hairdresser Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough) that eventually ended in controversy as she was publicly outed by her lover when they split in 1981.  Throughout King remained married to her first love Larry (played sympathetically but a little limply by Austin Stowell).  This is handled very tastefully and, for me, was the better part of the whole.\n\nSecond, and the source of the title, the movie explores sexism in the women&apos;s tennis game that led to her breaking away from the WTA and its sexist president, Jack Kramer (in an unconvincing performance by Bill Pullman), and taking on a challenge billed as THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES with 55 year old ex tennis champion and self proclaimed Male Chauvinist, Bobby Riggs (Steve Carrell).  \n\nI disliked Carell&apos;s part greatly, not because he didn&apos;t perform it well but that it is written to make him out to be a complete idiot (which no doubt he was).  He becomes a character of himself quickly and I neither liked nor disliked him (I was annoyed by him though).  It all makes for a strange mix of comedy, politics, sexuality and revolt.\n\nAnd the revolt was all too gentlemanly for me - despite the subject matter and the ire it must have stirred nobody really ever loses the plot and so the film lacks edge and dramatic tension.\n\nWhat&apos;s more, it&apos;s 30 minutes too long and the overwrought soundtrack (Nicholas Britell - it really is a shocker) is over-pervasive and just plain annoying.\n\nEmma Stone rarely puts a foot wrong in my view and at times you really do think BJK is on screen.  That part, and the general 70&apos;s styling of the movie, is excellent but it&apos;s ponderously directed and although the final shoot out between BJK and Riggs has an element of tension we all know the outcome and Britell&apos;s pomp and circumstance was gradually doing my nut in.\n\nJust because you loved Little Miss Sunshine it does not follow that you will love this.",

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re a geek this movie is for you. If you&apos;re a Star Wars geek this movie totally is for you. Basically it&apos;s a movie about Star Wars geeks made by Star Wars geeks for a target audience of Star Wars geeks. If you are not into all things Star Wars this movie may well miss the mark with you. And even the most rabid of Star Wars fans would have to concede that the movie is certainly not anything spectacular. It&apos;s fairly charming and reasonably amusing but never really riotously funny. But it works. More or less.\n\nThe movie is set in the autumn of 1998, a time before Jar Jar Binks had been foisted upon the world. Four friends, major Star Wars geeks all, decide to drive across the country, break into Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of The Phantom Menace. The major motivation for this journey is that one of the friends has cancer and will not live to see the movie released. But once that is established the cancer storyline is basically put on the back burner and this turns into a mostly predictable wacky road-trip comedy. Some of the wackiness works, some of it falls flat. There are a bunch of celebrity cameos thrown in, some of which are inspired and some of which are rather random and pointless. So it&apos;s a movie which has its ups and downs. But it&apos;s enjoyable more often than not and the movie breezes by in a nice, tight, well-paced 90 minutes.\n\nNone of the actors playing our gang of four really stand out in any memorable way. Dan Fogler&apos;s character is a little more outrageous than the others but that&apos;s about it. But the group works together well and they are ably supported by the varied cast of characters who pop up throughout. Seth Rogen&apos;s portrayal of a pimp is one of the standouts. Of course this ode to Star Wars fans wouldn&apos;t be complete without taking some shots at Trekkies. So there&apos;s room for another funny turn by an actor portraying Admiral Seasholtz, an uber-Trekkie. Who is the unrecognizable actor memorably bringing this character to life? You may have to wait until the closing credits roll to figure it out. And in this Star Wars geek universe there&apos;s room for one girl and Kristen Bell is both charming and funny in the role as her character gets swept along for the ride. Could the movie be a little more consistently funny? Most definitely. But the movie about Star Wars geeks will probably leave you with a smile on your face. Especially if you&apos;re a Star Wars geek yourself.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie has 2 stories that that run side by side, depicting the same image of war from different perspectives.\n\nDenzel&apos;s story is one of sadness and guilt over the death of a friend during the Gulf war, a friend that he himself killed in a &apos;Friendly Fire&apos; incident, during the confusion of battle. His country won&apos;t let him speak, and they shower him with medals; this only adds to the pain that begins to tear him apart.\n\nDenzel&apos;s Character is given an assignment to determine whether a female helicopter pilot (Meg Ryan) deserves the medal of honour.\n\nMeg&apos;s story, played out in flashbacks, is about a helicopter pilot and her crew saving a handful of soldiers, from the Iraqi onslaught. She is the first female to be considered for the medal of honour, and the question is, does she deserve what the American people would so love too see her receive.\n\nDenzel, determined to get this one right, collects evidence and testimony from Ryans crew and the men that were saved. The problem is, Denzel&apos;s superiors want this medal awarded, but the simple truth is difficult to unveil. Every shred of evidence leads to more and more uncertainty as to whether this medal should be awarded.\n\nTruly compelling direction and very special character portrayal make this an extremely enjoyable, very dramatic movie.\n\nIf you&apos;ve over looked it, then give it a try. I think you&apos;ll be glad you did.\n\n8/10",

Gave it about 48 minutes when I decided I had enough. The biggest problem with this movie is, like with so many others, I just didn&apos;t care. Even when a movie is violent and gritty, to get involved in it, you&apos;d at least need to feel for someone. Have some compassion for someone, hope that someone survives, gets revenge and &quot;saves the day&quot;. None of that in this one. Couldn&apos;t care less about who got hurt, shot, kidnapped or killed. Even if they would&apos;ve killed Hardy off, I would&apos;ve shrugged it off. Whatever.\n\nAll it is, is a chain of uninteresting bad guys (and bad girls) running around in an ugly scenery beating each other up and killing each other. Maybe it&apos;s just me, but I was bored.\n\n4 Stars because it&apos;s Tom Hardy. But it&apos;s time they upgrade him to what he really deserves. 007 Maybe?",

They get married, seem to start falling in love, but then the film turns into a twisting film.  These twists give some great scenes of power for Banderas and Jolie to work off of, plus a excellent amount of sex and nudity from Jolie and a good feeling for the movie throughout.  Unfortunately, the film has some flaws including an overused music score, overacting, scenes that make the film confusing, and an ending that had me a little dissapointed, then really dissapointed.  Still , it&apos;s OK.  Thomas Jane has some wicked fun playing a, uh, detective. B",

He enters the animal kingdom of suburban crime and stumbles through a minefield of sociopaths, cops and lawyers, all claiming to protect him. J soon learns though that trust means nothing when people are desperate.\n\nThis is a dramatic, well-made film that haunts the mind. Highly cinematic, meticulously crafted, thrilling and poignant in equal measure. The director emphasises realistic dialogue, multi-dimensional characters and underplays violence. Still, the film is palpably tense, there are scenes that will leave you shaking, even where there is no bloody payoff. As the body count builds even a car slowly reversing down a driveway becomes a menacing sight. The ending is satisfying.\n\nThe film is very well acted, young Frecheville keeps it natural and holds his own amongst titanic performances from veteran Aussies. Mendelsohn as Uncle Pope is particularly brilliant, dressed at Christmas from Lowes, this dorky suburban thug bullies the weak (including his passive younger brother Darren, unhappily entrenched in a life he cannot escape from), and who&apos;s confrontational behaviour springs from a deep well of paranoia. His maladjusted moral compass so skewed he frequently crosses into psychopathic territory. And yet he remains all too human, he&apos;s a mundane monster. Weaver too, leaves a memorable impression, where revelations abound in the film&apos;s third act.\n\nMy only complaint is that I would have liked to have seen a courtroom scene that is left to the imagination, we see corrupt police in action, why not a demonstration of hypocrisy in the justice system too? But this is a minor whinge in the grand scale of this ambitious story.",

Besides Rea, Whitaker, and Miranda Richardson, I&apos;d like to mention Jim Broadbent as a sympathetic bartender Col. For me, though, the absolutely stunning, one of the very best debuts in the movie history was Jaye Davidson who had no movie experience. You know, there are not many characters that I keep thinking about after the movie is over - where did they come from, how their life would turn after the final credits, how would this cruel world treat them, would they be happy? And I want them to be happy. Dil (Davidson) is one of them - what a marvelous creature, how vulnerable yet dignified she is, what a combination of dry remote coolness and quiet tenderness. No wonder, Fergus (Rea) (as Whitaker&apos;s Jody before him) fell under her spell even after he found out that nothing is what it seems. Great movie - makes you think, makes you feel, makes you talk about it, makes you want to see it again.\n\n9.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "When I registered with the IMDb, one of the survey questions asked what my favorite film was. I listed Allen&apos;s Crimes and Misdemeanors. I don&apos;t know if this is always true, but for the most part I feel fairly confident regarding my choice. Allen&apos;s story here works, like most well written literature, on many levels. It is funny (Woody&apos;s lessons), symbolic (the Rabbi going blind), ironic (the good suffer and the evil go unpunished), deep (faith and suicide), and is a film that leaves you with something to identify with and learn from. Even Hally Reed&apos;s (Mia Farrow) surprising revelation at the end of the film, which I won&apos;t reveal of course, shows us a bit about the dangers of prejudging others. Woody shows us that we shouldn&apos;t judge on the surface, but must look deeper into the individual value of people. Do we trust Hally, or do we stick to what we see as the truth about Lester (Alan Alda)? This is a lesson that Woody&apos;s character, Cliff, doesn&apos;t even fully grasp at the end of the film, but Allen gives us the insight, even though what Hally reveals about Lester goes against what we&apos;ve seen of him.\n\nCrimes and Misdemeanors is certainly not for all tastes. It&apos;s not exactly a film that people would watch for pure escapism. This is a film to be treasured, revisited and held up with some of the greatest films of all time. Not for how it looks or sounds, but for what it says. This is a film aimed at both the heart and the mind and succeeds in capturing both.",

The chemistry between Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx is praised, but the plot is deemed predictable and the humor uninspired. Some enjoy its light-hearted nature, while others find it unoriginal. Glenn Close and Andrew Scott receive mixed reactions. CGI and stunts are criticized, though visual effects get some commendation. Overall, it’s an entertaining yet uninspired film relying on star power.",

It&apos;s good for when you want to watch something quick and easy but doesn&apos;t take too much of a toll on you mentally. It has the action, comedy, and family oriented plot. This will easily become a comfort movie. I enjoyed watching Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx as parents. I do wish the acting was a little bit better for the other cast members such as the extras and the people who were supposedly on the bad side. There were some parts that were cringe but that&apos;s to be expected in a movie such as this one. But I would recommend the movie if you want something cute, quick, and doesn&apos;t require too much concentration.",

      "reviewBody": "If you are a Ek tha tiger, Dhoom 3, HNY, Bang Bang fanboy/girl, do not watch this movie and do not read this review either, it&apos;s just not for you. \n\nAkshay Kumar do not need to romance hot girls, do not need to dance and sing, do not need to do melodrama to deliver a hit movie, he had shown us this back in Special 26, he has done the same here in Baby. The cast is a perfect one and there are no flaws.\n\nMOVIE: It has everything a good espionage thriller need to have- 1. Good cop bad cop routine 2. Cute chick beating the pulp out of the bad guy 3. Super cool combat scenes 4. No unnecessary sentiments and drama 5. Some brilliant dialogues 6. few laugh out loud scenes 7. It focuses on modern warfare--an indirect one--proxy war, which is much spoken about in reference to India in recent times 8. Kick ass background score 9. Cool Spy v/s bad guys 10. funny Akshay Anupam Kher duo\n\nOn negatives: Yes even i think the movie was a bit lengthy, if the director had trimmed it 10-15 minutes it would had been great. Yet, this movie is a rare feat. Bollywood rarely delivers movies like this. Its a must watch if you like sensible movies. And regarding the negative reviews, just do not pay any heed to them, for THIS GEM IS NOT TO BE MISSED. Neeraj Pandey as a director has done a brilliant job.",

      "reviewBody": "From the opening moments of &apos;The Loft&apos; you can guess pretty much exactly what you&apos;re in for. A &quot;whodunnit&quot; mystery with plentiful twists, where not everything is as it seems. Knowing that much doesn&apos;t hurt a film at all. In fact it makes the next couple of hours something to be very much looked forward to - or at least for me it does. You could say the format of the genre is lacking in originality, but you could rarely say two films are the same and anyone who says they saw the ending coming is almost always lying or exaggerating a fleeting suspicious they had. This is why I love mystery-thrillers.\n\n&apos;The Loft&apos; is a fun watch - nothing more, nothing less. It achieves exactly what it sets out to. The 5 lead actors were all pretty solid and gave credible performances. I think I will always see Eric Stonestreet as his brilliant character from &apos;Modern Family&apos;, so I struggled a bit at first to take him seriously in his role here, but he&apos;s good enough of an actor to get past that. The dialogue was tightly written and every detail that could otherwise have been questioned was covered well. The only fault I could find was the score sometimes drowning out the dialogue which can be annoying in a film like this where you are trying to catch every spoken detail. Altogether though a fine movie.",

Perhaps that&apos;s because we feel at a distance from our core players despite always being in close proximity to them. Of course, there is something to be said for the flick&apos;s delicate exposition and otherwise subtle storytelling. It mostly works to an enigmatic effect. However, it&apos;s sometimes too subtle. Much of the lead&apos;s inner machinations are left up to interpretation, as she moves through the narrative with a blank face and only the simplest of dialogue. That&apos;s not to say that the film is particularly uninteresting. In fact, it&apos;s often rather intriguing. The issue is that it isn&apos;t all that engaging. Despite its great cinematography and understated camera-work, it isn&apos;t moving in any real way. It isn&apos;t so much boring as it is slow, though. I wish it was more captivating than it is, as it&apos;s a well-crafted movie with an under-explored setting, but it&apos;s worth a watch if you know what you&apos;re getting into. 6/10",

OK, so it&apos;s certainly no masterpiece, but it&apos;s also no Teenwolf 2 either. I think this is an underrated gem and deserves more than the 4.5 rating it has received.

But it is one of his most underrated films, perhaps even THE most underrated. By all means it is not perfect, as the story does have its silly and predictable moments, one or two parts in the middle half sag a tad in the pacing and the effects do seem creaky by today&apos;s standards, but it is not flat and unfunny like critics make it out to be and although I make every effort not to take IMDb ratings to heart I do think the rating is a disgrace for this film. The Golden Child may be flawed, but it also has its strengths, such as Eddie Murphy&apos;s charming performance, funny and smart script(or so I think), a fun performance from Charles Dance, decent direction and agreeable soundtrack. So overall, while it mayn&apos;t be to everybody&apos;s tastes, I do suggest you at least give The Golden Child a fair chance before judging it so harshly. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

The misfit Police Academy is now graduated creating a special but bumbling team to accomplish the most dangerous assignments and in this sequel to the first Police Academy movie, a nerdish storefront owner named Mr. Sweetchuck, is attacked and robbed of $8. By a local street gang known as &quot;The Scullions&quot; whom are led by the infantile Zed (Bobcat Goldthwait). After hearing about the incident, Chief Henry Hurst (George Robertson) arrives at the 16th precinct and notifies its captain, Pete Lassard (Howard Hesseman) that the precinct is the worst in the city for even old ladies throw things and spit at passing policemen on the street outside the station. Nevertheless, Hurst gives him 30 days or else Lassard is out. Before he leaves, the conniving Officer Mauser (Art Metrano) schemes his way into talking to Hurst. Hurst promises him the rank of captain should Lassard fail. Pete calls his brother, who happens to be Commandant Eric Lassard (George Gaynes) and asks him for six new recruits, as was promised by Hurst. Throughout the movie, Mauser is seen scheming with his dim-witted partner Sgt. Proctor (Lance Kinsey) as he attempts to take control of the precinct. The recently graduated Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf), Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), Laverne Hooks (Marion Ramsey), and Douglas Fackler (Bruce Mahler) join the 16th precinct, and some are assigned a veteran officer partner since they&apos;re rookies: Fackler has Dooley (Ed Herihly), Mahoney has the overweight Vinnie Schtulman (Peter van Norden), and Tackleberry has Sgt. Kathleen Kirkland (Colleen Camp). As the more bumbling team formed by the police officer friends (Steve Guttenberg : Mahoney, Bubba Smith : Hightower , Michael Winslow : Jones , David Graf : Tackleberry ) are assigned the first assignment to fight crime once again plaguing the streets. A wacky wizard of Ozzy and his leathered and studded band of punky pranksters are on the prowl, spray-painting the town red and emptying the pockets of anyone sharing the sidewalk. In the wake of the new crime wave, people might be wondering where the educational system has gone wrong. But relax, America. Think of the academy. Now that&apos;s the kind of school people can trust, the kind of school whose grads fight crime with slapstick instead of nightsticks. Those goofy oddballs in blue are going to tangle with the pinhead punkers. The Police Academy regulars, from meathead Mahoney to the impeccably inept Cmdt. Lassard, are back again to answer law enforcement&apos;s most uproarious role call. Take off with the original cast... and some new recruits as they take to the streets and the skies to fight crime . On land, on sea, or in the air, no place is safe from them! Assignment: new recruits . Objective: Laughs. Hold everything! The cadets are training for an all new adventure !\n\nAmusing , funny and very cheerful film filled with action-packed , thrills , hilarious set-pieces, tongue-in-cheek and lots of humor .The premise is simple and plain , as a misfit , botcher squadron from the known police force is assigned the first mission and subsequently to undertake a confrontation to a dangerous gang . Director delivers a professional work but with no much interest , his knack of getting the most out of characters and situations without ever going over the top making for some very big laughs . This production pays tribute to previous film , taking parts here and there , and repeating former sketches. The jokes and frolics come as thick and fast , hit and miss as usual and it is done in good spirit if not always in good taste . Nice picture with accent on sight gags , and humour that stems from the diverting roles established in other movies . The sympathetic cast formed by the motley band of misfits gives fun interpretation creating confusion , laughs and mayhem. Showing up habitual actors in the popular series, such as Seve Guttenberg as Mahoney, Bubba Smith as Hightower , Michael Winslow , David Graf , Tim Kazurinsky and adding a newcomer : Colleen Camp. While G. W. Bailey had hoped to return as Lieutenant Harris, but was passed over in favor of Art Metrano as the antagonist in this film , but he appeared in Police Academy 4 and others sequels . However, original cast members had allegedly complained about losing screentime to the new cast members. It contains an attractive and lively score by Robert Folk , series&apos; regular , including the classic leitmotif . As well as atmospheric and appropriate cinematography by James Crabe . The motion picture was regular but professionally directed by Jerry Paris and James Signorelli , but with no originality .\n\nThe series based on the chracters written by Neal Israel and Pat Proft are the following ones : Police Academy 1984 by Hugh Wilson . Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment 1985 by Jerry Paris , James Signorelli . Police Academy 3: Back in Training 1987 by Jerry Paris . Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol 1987 by Jim Drake . Police Academy : Assignment Miami Beach 1988 by Alan Myerson. Police Academy 6: City Under Siege 1989 by Peter Bornerz . Police Academy: Mission to Moscow 1994 by Alan Metter . And Police Academy the series 1997/1998 , 26 episodes by Neal Israel, Paul Maslansky, Pat Proft .",

However, when it came out on video, I watched it again and I laughed so hard I couldn&apos;t believe it was the same movie.  It just worked so much better at home on the small screen.  So my advice to anyone who saw it in the theater and was not struck by it, try it again as a rental and you may be surprised.  And of course, if you haven&apos;t seen it, I do recommend it, for it is a fun movie and is actually quite entertaining, especially if you like the stars, which most people do.",

I&apos;m not a huge fan of the Beavis &amp; Butt-Head television series, I like it but don&apos;t love it and that&apos;s the same way I felt about this, I don&apos;t have any care or sympathy for these characters, but seeing them behave like huge idiots in this movie, which is basically just a long episode of the series, was certainly a good time. Die hard fans of the television series will certainly love it, as for people who have never seen a single episode, it is still worth the watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. \n\nAfter their TV is stolen, Beavis &amp; Butt-Head travel across America in search of it.",

The film almost belongs to the technical department; The production/set design, cinematography and other technical values were top-notch. The score along with some soundtracks were well-chosen, serving the narrative well in the background. This movie is eye candy. As for the story, it is savagely predictable &apos;course but the movie has an edge to it that makes it a standout. Halfway through the movie, a certain event happened and most of the things that takes place after that are somewhat trippy so it is best to accept it for what it is. The cast performance was good enough to keep one engaged with the characters. Overall, while this movie has its flaw, it is a really well-made movie technically and quite enjoyable if one doesn&apos;t think too hard.",

      "reviewBody": "During the 2010 Winter Olympics, NBC broadcast a 30-minute documentary piece on the 1980 US Olympic ice hockey team. While I knew the story of how they beat the Soviets and won the Gold Medal (I had seen it live as a kid), I was expecting some clichéd rhetoric about the team and what they had done, akin to films like &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot; (1940) and &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story was anything but. The coach of that team, Herbert Brooks, was no hackneyed clone of a Knute Rockne or a Vince Limbardo. Instead he was a tight-fisted uncompromising hockey general who distanced himself from his players, more like a Bobby Knight than a Knute. This was not someone with whom teammates would feel comfortable having a beer. Instead, his inspiration to the players came from the other direction, by exposing their weaknesses and in some cases using unfairness and resentment as anchors from which to get the best out of his players. I decided that &quot;Miracle&quot; might be worth a look, especially as a prelude to the US vs Canada in the gold medal round of 2010 Olympic Hockey.\n\nKurt Russell portrays Herbert Brooks as a lean and mean hockey coach who leaves sentimentality at the front door of the ice hockey rink. From the get-go he informs his players he&apos;s not there to be their friend. His goal is to let loose their highest playing potential coupled with the best conditioning among the Olympic hockey players at all costs. At times, he seems to be driving the players too hard well-beyond their comfort zones. Much of the story is the unconventional training techniques he uses to prepare the players for the 1980 Winter Olympics. According to the film, Brooks is relatively new to these techniques which he adopted while studying USSR hockey. His plan is to use the Soviets&apos; techniques against them in the Olympics, which is not just about strategy but also about extreme discipline and an uncompromising tough sensibility akin to the military. One character points out that everything Brooks does has a purpose behind it. \n\nThe only short-coming in the script may be the portrayal of Brooks&apos; wife who finds her relationship with her husband compromised, at least according to the film. I wondered if it played out in real life as in the film or if it was fabricated by the screenwriters. Too many sports movies have this sort of relationship with the wife acting as the balance between the obsessive coach and the needs of his family. She&apos;s been through this before. Why did she marry him in the first place? To be a successful account?\n\nCertainly, most Americans know the outcome of the story, although the sequence of the game between the US and the Soviets is riveting and plays out about as well as the fight between Rocky and Apollo Creed. However, the meat of the story is really about the relationship between Brooks and his players, and the coach&apos;s single-minded determination to create the best Olympic team possible. By putting a certain amount of anger and determination into their hearts and heads, Brooks brings out the best in them, much like a sergeant in boot camp. The speech before the Americans played the Soviets is one of the better scenes of its type, leaving behind the &quot;do it for the Gipper&quot; silliness that has become a sports cliché. The only moment which was lacking in the film was the speech before the very final game when the US played Finland after the Soviets. In that speech, apparently Brooks told his team that if they didn&apos;t win, they would go to their graves regretting the missed opportunity. I would have liked to have seen Russell give that speech as well. Apparently Herb Brooks died before the principal shooting of this film had ended, and the film is dedicated to him. Just about as fitting a tribute as a coach could ask for.",

Metascore rated this movie 60 whilst it should be 75 minimum. Watch and if I am wrong please tell me why.\n\nMichael Fassbender just takes emotion to a very realistic place and portrays a man with fear , regrets , love. The decision he makes , as a man , we can relate to it. Alicia Vikander also takes you on a journey that helps you understand what being a parent mean and the sacrifices that comes along with it. \n\nRachel Weisz plays her role very well and together with the two main actors gives us some very emotional scene. I was touched by this movie and blow away by the acting. \n\nSome beautiful shots are taken and really helps to get in the mood for something different , heartbreaking , questionable . The line between right and wrong can be difficult to see and this movie also decides not to give you what you expect. The narrative of the story is simple and yet very complicated once you try understand the reasons for certain decision. Without really realising you , as an audience you start to ask yourself , what would do , as a women , as a man. \n\nQuestions like this scares people unfortunately , but I think we should embrace those movies that challenges you emotionally. It is part of who we are.",

Kate and Luke use their love of beer as an excuse to hang out while concealing their amorous agenda and ambivalence in an alcoholic haze. The improvised dialog does deliver some amusing moments, but there are too many repetitive exchanges which dissipate the film&apos;s energy. \n\nThe two lead actors create credible characters, but Swanberg doesn&apos;t give them anywhere particularly interesting to go, and there doesn&apos;t appear to be anything of great value at stake. Kate and Luke&apos;s Romeo and Juliette saga turns into a circular song-and-dance routine, until their friendship becomes infected by frustration, leading to dishonesty and irritability. The concept is intriguing, but the film turns into an effective endorsement of sobriety. Swanberg has shown he can do better than this, and the end titles arrive just in time.",

      "reviewBody": "This film exists on several levels. It is partly a film about combat trauma, memory and repression, partly about the specifics of Israel&apos;s role in the Lebanese civil war, and partly about war in general as experienced by soldiers. It was cleverly constructed, moving back and forth from the middle-aged protagonist and his search for his lost memories via contacting old comrades, and the depiction of the actual events during the time of his and their youth. The film is mostly done in animation and uses animation in a very effective way.\n\nI do not believe it is at all relevant what someone&apos;s political opinions are in terms of appreciating this film. The film reveals truth through taking the viewer on a journey to the past through the memories of people who witnessed the worst days of the conflict.",

Surfing the net, I find almost nothing but bad reviews for this film, despite being one of the best Sci-Fi films to be released by Warner Bros. in the last couple of years.  It features an award-caliber performance from Kurt Russell (himself an underrated actor,)a smart script and stylish direction.  Yet people insist it&apos;s a pile of cow pat.  This character-driven movie is certainly better than, say, &quot;The Matrix,&quot; which suffered from plot and logic holes, and had one of the worst endings ever.  Although, admittedly, &quot;Matrix&quot; was meant to be a &quot;Dumb&quot; film, while &quot;Soldier&quot; is smarter than you think.  The script never flinches, never compromises it&apos;s purpose or characters, and director Anderson (of &quot;Event Horizon,&quot; the best horror-in-space movie since &quot;Alien&quot;) shows sci-fi works better as a setting than a genre.  And as for Russell, he shows more emotion and character in his performance than most Oscar winners, being extremely sympathetic even when doing unsympathetic things.\n\nSo I say ignore the gup about this being a bad movie.  If you are a real sci-fi film lover, throw out &quot;The Matrix&quot; and get &quot;Soldier&quot; instead."

It combined action with a cool art style and serious plots that made the show just as appealing to adults as it was to kids. Mask of the Phantasm is a side-story of that amazing show, so it&apos;s no surprise that I still love it all these years later.\n\nPhantasm works so well because it pairs the usual themes of the show with an extremely bittersweet love story and tons of the detective elements that are always present in Batman&apos;s best tales. Equal time is spent with the present day mystery of the Phantasm, and Bruce&apos;s early experiments with vigilante justice. \n\nIt&apos;s great to see Bruce Wayne get equal focus in the story, and in many ways the scenes with him out of costume are the most interesting and pivotal to the story. The Joker plays a crucial part in the plot, and a woman is introduced who had a powerful influence on Bruce&apos;s decision to become Batman. What more could the true Batman fan ask for? Mask of the Phantasm is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as The Dark Knight and Batman Returns. There&apos;s a classic story within its animated trappings.",

When we struggled for social acceptance, worried about making good grades and getting into college. And most of all finding the right first love that you were mad about! And this film covers all of those themes.\n\nSet in New York City at a prep high school you have an odd and lonely out of place boy George(Freddie Highmore) who&apos;s searching for social acceptance while he slacks and struggles with his grades. Also his mother Vivian(Rita Wilson) is having problems of her own with George&apos;s stepfather and money woes are painful. It&apos;s upon meeting a girl that George has loved from a distance that gives him hope. Enter Sally(good performance from Emma Roberts)a southern girl who&apos;s moved north with her sexy and extroverted mother Charlotte(Elizabeth Reaser). And as typical the ups and downs of meeting, partying, and hanging out come and go and the typical hormones rage also. In the end George learns both a discovery of art and love. Overall nothing great it&apos;s somewhat predictable still it&apos;s theme and message is memorable and true this film is an all right watch.",

Just a ordinary, very funny comedy.\n\n Samy Naceri and Frederic Diefenthal return when a Japanese minister comes to France for some kind of new defense strategy. Of course, that strategy has to be showed, and than it goes wrong. The Japanese minister is kidnapped and the police tries with the help of Samy Naceri to get him back.\n\nThe final of the film is a bit overdone, when almost a dozen police-cars hit each other near to the Eiffel tower. Absolutely not realistic, but that&apos;s not such a bad thing, isn&apos;t it? It&apos;s the result of a great car-chase before, and the things that happen then are so dumb but so funny; irresistible. The greatest moment of the movie is when Samy Naceri, Frederic Diefenthal, some Japanese girl and the military father of Samy Naceri&apos;s girlfriend jump out of a plane. And when they come down...great, great, great, great!\n\nTaxi 2 is a real must-see. Typically French, but great fun."

      "reviewBody": "Victor Frankenstein is the son of a famous doctor who watches his mother die in labour with his younger brother.  As an idealistic young man he travels to university to study to become a great doctor.  However he brings with him non-scientific teachings he has researched into life and the influence of electric currents.  His belief is supported by shadowy lecturer Dr Waldeman and Frankenstein continues his work and brings a man back to life using parts of other men.  Realising what he has done, Frankenstein leaves his monster to die but the creature learns fast and wants revenge for his creation.\n\nI have seen far too many monster movies that all blur together and share the same focus on effects and gore than story or character.  So when this was promoted as being close to the original material, dark and more of a story than a horror I was looking forward to watching it.  For the most part it sort of works but it&apos;s main flaw runs all the way through it like a stick of rock  it&apos;s far too worthy.  Or at least it thinks it is.  The film has a constant swell of dramatic music that is only ever seconds away and it really makes the film feel grander and more serious than it really is.  The film isn&apos;t scary but that wasn&apos;t a problem to me  it just has all these big worthy dialogue scenes with sudden pauses (up comes the music) and then lines.  It doesn&apos;t work and the film feels heavy and even dull as a result.\n\nThis is never more evident than in Branagh&apos;s own performance.  He is far too dashing and too much of a young man gone wrong to be believed.  If he&apos;d played it a little less worthy he would have been more of a human and less a cardboard type.  De Niro really tries hard and did well for me.  He may be stuck with a creature but it has been developed past the cliché (but not far enough perhaps).  I did feel for him and it was all De Niro&apos;s doing.  Carter is miscast both before and after  far to light and modern for the role, Briers is OK but Cleese is way to miscast.  First of all the fact that he only appears half in shadows and when he opens his mouth the music comes up doesn&apos;t help, but it didn&apos;t feel like him.  Quinn is a good cameo but the majority of the cast seem to have bought into the whole `worthy&apos; thing and are dulled as a result.\n\nOverall the film is worth watching because it is a good telling of the classic tale and De Niro does a good job of showing us the basic human behind the combined dead body parts.  If only Branagh hadn&apos;t been overwhelmed by the sheer importance of what he thought he was doing and had let the film flow and bit more and given in less to worthy music, acting and directing."

This movie was amazing! the 3D was incredible, the dancing was out of this world, the songs on the film were amazing! my and my girlfriend were singing along to them, but the storyline lacked abit, apart from the storyline, Justin Chi has made the perfect dance film! I&apos;m even debating going to see this movie again next week! although the last too step up movies lacked character, the latest instalment in the franchise definitely gives the trilogy the buzz that it needs! i rate this movie 9/10, it would of been 10/10 if the storyline wasn&apos;t lacking abit! even if you hate dance movies this movie in definitely worth watching.",

Two films coming out in the same year, set on the same planet, with the same production values and featuring casts of equal talent. While both movies also feature numerous scientific inaccuracies and stupidities, each has something different to offer. If you are looking for mystique, try Mission to Mars, but if you want action or thrills, then go with Red Planet.\n\nSet in the mid twenty first century, Earth is dying, and humanity has turned to Mars as a potential replacement. An unmanned terraforming experiment has been attempted (according to the introductory narration) Months later, it appears to have failed, so a group of astronauts are sent out to investigate. They are surprised and excited to discover not only breathable air but the existence of life on the barren cold red world. When their space craft shuts down however, not only are they stranded, but they become threatened by the malfunctioning of their navigator droid &apos;Amee&apos;. These few individuals must survive to carry the news back to Earth which proves that man can live on the Red Planet.\n\nI think the story works decently as a nifty sci-fi thriller. Mars in this film looks quite convincing, because the terrain closely resembles the photographs taken by the Pathfinder in 1997. The color scheme is made up of browns and tans, rather than the over saturated red from Mission to Mars. \n\nRet Planet was received better than Brian De Palma&apos;s movie, and I can see why. Although neither of them are examples of great filmaking, I would recommend them both.",

      "reviewBody": "For a film with such a simple story and such little dialogue, &apos;Arctic&apos; is successful at holding your attention throughout thanks to its compelling and well-told storyline. I initially thought this film was based on a true story - not sure why - but the fact I did probably shows how authentic and realistic &apos;Arctic&apos; feels. It&apos;s a proper survival story without any Hollywood gloss.\n\nThe cinematography in &apos;Arctic&apos; is excellent, capturing the stunning Arctic landscapes perfectly. It looks great and the bleak setting really adds to the mood of the film. Mads Mikkelsen is once again very impressive as the main (and for the most part only) character in the film.\n\n&apos;Arctic&apos; is definitely worth watching - an all-round very good survival film that benefits from the simplicity of its plot. Well-made, well-acted and has no trouble in holding your attention from start to finish.",

      "reviewBody": "Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief, Loki&apos;s mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie &quot;Son of the Mask.&quot; Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this? And he responds &quot;Cuz I gotta!&quot; Unfortunately, that answer doesn&apos;t cover it because after seeing Son of the Mask I still left the theatre thinking, &quot;Good Lord, Why?&quot; Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party.\n\nThe Son of the Mask begins with Otis the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner Tim Avery, a clear homage to legendary Loony Toons creator Tex Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to one-day draw for. On the night of the company Halloween party, Tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous, insane character that we all expect. After the party Tim goes home, mask still on and conceives a child with his wife. Nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers. Otis the dog, jealous of the baby&apos;s attention, puts on the mask and partakes in Tom and Jerry type mayhem to out the baby. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is in search for his mask at the orders of his father, Odin.\n\nFirst off, ill admit that I do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with its Wile E. Coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot. However, this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time.\n\nThe premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly. Silly is not always a bad thing, but in this movie, the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying. The characters are not fun to watch, and what&apos;s worse, they&apos;re not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the greatest things about the original is that while, obviously computer animation was used, so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of just being. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, was an actual cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn&apos;t have that kind of ability, a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift. The baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie. The side story of Loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying.\n\nThe son of the Mask is a sad sad state of affairs. What I suggest is you go rent or buy the original the Mask and thank the Norse gods, or whoever, for bringing it to us. And will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as I continue to ask the infamous question &quot;WHY?&quot; The son of the Mask gets one star, although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be, in my book, the mask.",

His ability to convey both charisma and menace, leaves an indelible mark.\n\nDiCaprio demonstrates an astonishing range, portraying the vulnerability of a boy navigating the challenges of adolescence while simultaneously showcasing an inner strength that defines his character. His ability to convey a wide spectrum of emotions, from the pain of abuse to the determination to overcome adversity is inspiring.\n\nThe dynamic between De Niro and DiCaprio is nothing short of electrifying. Their scenes together are charged with tension, drawing the audience into the complex father-son relationship. Their collaboration elevates the narrative, turning it into a compelling exploration of identity, survival, and the enduring impact of challenging relationships.\n\nWhile many will find the movie a struggle to watch and quite tragic, its actually one of hope, optimism and resilience. The underlying tone of Dicaprio&apos;s character throughout the movie is one of the optimism for a better future.",

The interpretations of both Tom Holland who played as Todd and Daisy Ridley who played as Viola were very good and the combination of both worked very well. The direction which was made by Doug Liman, it was very good and he did an excellent job on how he presented both his main characters and the plot, something that made more clear a lot of things that could confuse the audience. To sum up, I have to say that &quot;Chaos Walking&quot; is an interesting movie and I advise you not to hear the critics and just watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it.",

The physical resemblance of some characters to their animated self were very funny especially the bad guy (who&apos;s name is escaping me, but he&apos;s the other architect). I don&apos;t know how this movie played in English; my first language is french so i didn&apos;t have that problem... I imagine some of the jokes weren&apos;t that easy to translate. I&apos;ve learned something with years it&apos;s better to watch a movie with the subtitles than with the dubbing maybe you wont understand what is said, but you wont lose the rhythm and i think that&apos;s important too.

      "reviewBody": "La Marche de l&apos;Empereur (2005) is a french documentary that features the habits of penguins during the course of one year: their mating rituals, their migrations, laying of the eggs, searching for food, etc. It also shows them facing a danger or two, and (what for me was the highlight of the movie) the moment when the baby penguins break out of their shells! The movie is visually astounding. The cinematographer has managed to capture extreme close-ups where you can see the pattern of their feathers, as well as breath-taking longshots of hundreds of penguins marching on the beautiful icy backdrop. There is also a suspenseful underwater sequence.\n\nThe movie is accompanied with poetic voice-overs that tell the story from the penguins&apos; point of view, and gentle ambiance music. There are also a few laughs here and there, as penguins bump into each other or slip on the ice.\n\nThe movie could have been handled better from a dramatic storytelling stand-point, but it seemed the director was aiming to create a sort of poetic new age nature movie, and as such, it works perfectly. Admittedly, there are points where the style starts to wear on you, and some parts seem to be repeating themselves, but at 80 minutes long the movie doesn&apos;t overstay its welcome.\n\nAll in all, the movie is a memorable experience, and manages to be informative and entertaining at the same time, and even manages to be moving on occasion. And penguins are simply the cutest animals!",

      "reviewBody": "This quiet, understated drama-thriller may take a while to get going, but the characters are fascinating and Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jeff Daniels have a wonderful chemistry that lends the film an unexpected heart. As a brain-damaged student and a blind wannabe entrepreneur respectively, their relationship is very sweet and would probably work well in a buddy comedy. \n\nThere&apos;s a neat Fargo-like quality to a lot of the characters and dialogue and while it covers few locations it has that convincing small town feel.\n\nGordon-Levitt is a night janitor at a local bank who&apos;s targeted by a gang and finessed into acting as a lookout while they rob it. Things - as they must - go wrong and he has to summon all the faculties of his fractured mind to save himself.\n\nIsla Fisher is quite revelatory in her small role. As Luvlee she&apos;s either rather dim-witted or incredibly cunning. Fisher&apos;s performance hints at the deeper recesses of her character but doesn&apos;t reveal what they hide. Luvlee is one of those rare characters where you find yourself genuinely hoping they won&apos;t turn out to be something other than what they appear. Ultimately there&apos;s something curiously redemptive about Gordon-Levitt&apos;s journey, where there really shouldn&apos;t be. It&apos;s a testament to the quality of his performance.\n\nOverall a satisfying drama with sustained tension and some fine performances."

      "reviewBody": "Ben Affleck&apos;s new movie could best be described as &quot;sprawling&quot;. In both directing and writing the screenplay (based on a novel by Dennis Lehane), Affleck has aimed for a &quot;Godfather&quot; style gangster epic and missed: not missed by a country mile, but missed nonetheless.\n\nMorally bankrupted by his experiences in the trenches, Joe Coughlin (Affleck) returns to Boston to pick and choose which social rules he wants to follow. Not sociopathic per se, as he has a strong personal code of conduct, but Coughlin turns to robbery walking a delicate path between the warring mob factions of the Irish community, led by Albert White (the excellent Robert Glenister from TV&apos;s &quot;Hustle&quot;), and the Italian community, led by Maso Pescatore (Remo Girone). Trying to keep him out of jail is his father (&quot;Harry Potter&quot;&apos;s Brendan Gleeson) who – usefully – is the Deputy Police Chief. Life gets complicated when he falls in love with White&apos;s moll, Emma Gould (Sienna Miller). The scene is set for a drama stretching from Boston to the hot and steamy Everglades over a period of the next twenty years.\n\nAlthough a watchable popcorn film, the choppy episodic nature of the movie is hugely frustrating, with no compelling story arc to glue all of the disparate parts together. The (often very violent) action scenes are very well done and exciting but as a viewer you don&apos;t feel invested in a &apos;journey&apos; from the beginning of the film to the (unsatisfactory) ending. In my experience it&apos;s never a good sign when the writer considers it necessary to add a voice-over to the soundtrack, and here Affleck mutters truisms about his thoughts and motives that irritate more than illuminate.\n\nThe sheer volume of players in the piece (there are about three film&apos;s worth in here) and the resulting minimal screen time given to each allows no time for character development. Unfortunately the result is that you really care very little about whether people live or die and big plot developments land as rather an &quot;oh&quot; than an &quot;OH!&quot;.\n\nAffleck puts in a great turn as the autistic central character whose condition results in a cold, calculating demeanor and a complete lack of emotion reflecting on his face. Oh, hang on no, wait a minute sorry I&apos;ve got the wrong film. I&apos;m thinking about &quot;The Accountant&quot;. I don&apos;t know whether he filmed these films in parallel. I generally enjoy Ben Affleck&apos;s work (he was excellent in &quot;The Town&quot;) but for 95% of this film his part could have been completed by a burly extra with an Affleck mask on. In terms of acting range, his facial muscles barely get to a &quot;2&quot; on the scale. Given the double problem that he is barely credible as the &quot;young man&quot; returning mentally wounded from the trenches, then in my opinion he would have been better to have focused on the writing and directing and found a lead of the likes of an Andrew Garfield to fill Coughlin&apos;s shoes.\n\nThat&apos;s not to say there is not some good acting present in their all but brief supporting roles. Elle Fanning (&quot;Trumbo&quot;, &quot;Maleficent&quot;) in particular shines as the Southern belle Loretta Figgis: a religious zealot driving her police chief father (Chris Cooper, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;) to distraction. Cooper also delivers a star turn as the moral but pragmatic law-man.\n\nSienna Miller (&quot;Foxcatcher&quot;) delivers a passable Cork accent and does her best to develop some believable chemistry with the rock-like Affleck. Zoe Saldana (&quot;Star Trek&quot;) is equally effective as a Cuban humanitarian.\n\nIn summary, it&apos;s sprawlingly watchable but overall a disappointment, with Affleck over-reaching. One day we surely will get a gangster film the likes of another &quot;Godfather&quot;, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; or &quot;Untouchables&quot;. Although this has its moments, unfortunately it&apos;s more towards the &quot;Public Enemies&quot; end of the genre spectrum.\n\n(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com.

      "reviewBody": "Surely only those with some knowledge of musical history and consequently at least some love of music, or perhaps a penchant for eccentricity like myself, will ever have heard of Florence Foster Jenkins, reputedly the world&apos;s worst singer, so without a ready-made audience why a biopic now, (two, if you count the new French film &quot;Marguerite&quot;)? Maybe someone somewhere saw in this tale of a deluded grande dame a star vehicle for a talented actress of a certain age as well as an audience-pleasing combination of comedy and pathos and that&apos;s exactly what you get. No real knowledge of the subject is necessary to enjoy Stephen Frears&apos; hugely enjoyable biopic &quot;Florence Foster Jenkins&quot; which combines comedy, pathos and a close to career best performance from Meryl Streep, (who else), to terrific effect and if you think Streep can play anything, in her sleep if necessary, pause a moment. On a technical level she may be the most versatile actress in the world but much too often she&apos;s been accused of failing to connect on an emotional level. I&apos;ve always felt her Margaret Thatcher a great piece of mimicry but hardly worthy of a third Oscar and there are those who will claim that her Florence Foster Jenkins is nothing more than a shameless ploy for that elusive fourth Oscar. I will simply say that if she is to win that fourth Oscar surely it has to be for this great performance. Streep clicks on every level; this a tragic-comic performance of the first water in which Meryl never puts a foot wrong and yes, technically it&apos;s a marvel too with Streep doing her own appallingly off-key singing, (no mean feat for an actress with a superb voice). This isn&apos;t just the best thing she&apos;s done since &quot;Doubt&quot; but one of the best things she&apos;s ever done.\n\nAmazingly it isn&apos;t all a one-woman show; the big revelation here is Hugh Grant as Jenkins&apos; husband, the man who loves her, you might say exploits her, and does his best to protect her. It&apos;s the least Hugh Grant-like performance of his career and he&apos;s never been better. Likewise &quot;The Big Bang Theory&apos;s&quot; Simon Helberg as Cosme McMoon, Jenkins&apos; accompanist, is outstanding in a difficult role. It&apos;s also beautifully written by Nicholas Martin, looks great, (the period detail is spot on), and is very well directed by Frears. As we head into the silly season of superhero blockbusters and the kind of of films designed to keep the kids quiet in the summer months this splendid biography may be the last good movie we will see at our multiplexes for months.",

The most recent film to make me shiver with fear was WHAT LIES BENEATH and I saw that quite some time ago. CHILDREN OF THE CORN, did not really scare me, however, it did have a very good shock factor. It made me jump once or twice and I was generally enthralled with the story.\n\nHaving not read the Stephen King short story (I can&apos;t find a copy of the book) I found this film to be wholly original and terrifying in the film&apos;s idea. I just watched this movie for the first time last night, which is really something because I have already seen most of the classic horror films that people say are really good. CHILDREN OF THE CORN is probably one of the last really *good* horror films of the early 1980s that I have just seen.\n\nI thought the film&apos;s ideas were creepy and the execution is done wonderfully. You will never eat corn the same way again. CHILDREN OF THE CORN gets 4/5."

Sean Bean always plays a believable villain and Michael Douglas usually plays roles that keep the audience&apos;s attention....so the almost- two hours go by pretty quickly. The whole cast, actually, pretty good with no one person standing out.\n\nThe story loses points because the ending goes on too long and has the standard villain-holds-the-gun-and-doesn&apos;t shoot-too long cliché which drives critics, me included crazy. That, and a bit too many f-words in here by the female cop (Jennifer Esposito) which simply aren&apos;t necessary, and a few other holes all reduce this from a sure 9-star to an &quot;8.....but don&apos;t misunderstand: it&apos;s worth a look.",

This is exactly what this is.\n\nThere is nothing clever or earth-shattering about this. There a few shoot outs and some witty banter but no one was vying for an Oscar here. If you are expecting something special or life changing you may need to look further a field.\n\nThere is a bit of comedy between Shaft senior and junior, mainly poking fun at millennials and the older generation. This was all harmless enough and, although not laugh out loud funny, was funny enough.\n\nMaybe not one for die hard Shaft fans, adrenaline junkies, or high browers but it kills two hours easily enough.",

The film has a very stylish surface to it, but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others. One of the film`s strongest aspects is it`s performances, Brad Pitt is startlingly great as a trailer-trash psycho named Early. Pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend, her innocence is almost heart-breaking. &quot;Kalifornia&quot; has a very simple plot to it, that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour, but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder, as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are alot of shocking scenes, and it all mounts to a power-house climax that will haunt you for days. &quot;Kalifonia&quot; is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be, and not only for it`s violence and gore.",

      "name": "Aesthetically pleasing, but the narrative is predictable and clichéd",
      "reviewBody": "Hotel Artemis is a film which doesn&apos;t do a great deal wrong. However, it is also a film which doesn&apos;t do a great deal right. It just kind of hangs in mid-air, with clichéd characters acting in clichéd ways and having clichéd conversations. And then it ends. It&apos;s not actually about anything. It&apos;s also predictable, with precious little substance. It looks pretty though.\n\nIn 2028, riots are tearing Los Angeles apart. The film takes place primarily in the eponymous Hotel Artemis, a secret hospital for criminals in the heart of the city. The motley crew of characters, many of whom are known only by the name of the room in which they&apos;re staying, include Waikiki (Sterling K. Brown) and his brother Honolulu (Brian Tyree Henry), bank robbers who have been involved in a shootout with police; Nice (Sofia Boutella), an assassin who &quot;only kills important people&quot;, and just so happens to be Waikiki&apos;s ex-girlfriend; and Acapulco (a spectacularly miscast Charlie Day), a weapons dealer and all round weasel. Also present are The Wolf King (Jeff Goldblum), Los Angeles&apos;s most feared gangster, who also finances the hospital; his incompetent son, Crosby (an underutilised Zachary Quinto); and Morgan (Jenny Slate), a cop injured in the riots. The hospital is run by &quot;Nurse&quot; (Jodie Foster), an agoraphobic alcoholic haunted by visions of her past, with porter duties handled by Everest (Dave Bautista). The hospital functions because all guests must adhere to a rigid set of rules (the first of which is &quot;don&apos;t kill the other patients&quot;) and a strict no weapons policy.\n\nSounds pretty interesting doesn&apos;t it? It&apos;s not. The dialogue is awful, the narrative beats can be seen coming a mile away, and the characters are all architypes, with only Nurse really fleshed out to any degree. There&apos;s the loud-mouth snivelling weapons dealer, the gorgeous but oh-so-deadly assassin, the criminal kingpin and his screw-up son who just wants to be like dad, the skilled bank robber who spends most of his time trying to get himself out of the trouble caused by his unreliable brother, and the tough-as-old-boots medical professional who just wants to help people when in actual fact, she&apos;s beyond help herself. The premise may be reasonably interesting, but, in his debut feature, writer/director Drew Pearce undermines it by populating the milieu with cardboard cut-outs instead of characters. True, most of the actors give it their all (Bautista in particular gives a performance far superior to the material with which he has to work), but there&apos;s just no substance here, no depth. There are simply too many clichés at every level to be able to overlook them.\n\nYes, it&apos;s an original(ish) idea made with a small(ish) budget, which is exactly what we need more of these days, when every second film is a CGI-infested remake, comic book adaptation, or sequel (or a CGI-infested remake of a sequel to a comic book adaptation). However, an original idea is all very well and good, but it can only take you so far; the execution has to be there as well, and this is where Hotel Artemis falls down. It&apos;s simply not an especially well-made film. Pearce does a reasonably good job with the directorial side of things, as aesthetically, the hotel is really intriguing, with a nice use of primary colours and a well-conceived juxtaposition of modern technology and 3D printers with retro décor and secret passages. In terms of plot, however, there&apos;s just nothing to latch onto or get your teeth into. None of the characters really do or say anything very interesting, and a half-hour into the film, as it became increasingly apparent that none of them were going to be developed to any great degree, I just stopped caring.",

It felt as though there was a think tank meeting where some important ideas were thought of and they decided to explore those without really fleshing them out. There were hardly any jump scares or truly unique elements of horror, overall just a very predictable plot. Despite the runtime, this movie felt very fast, almost like an episode of a TV show. This in combination with an unbearably cringy script for the best friend/roomate character made this my least favorite movie of the franchise and one that I could&apos;ve lived without.",

The film was unique in not having violence or a villain and guess what it worked beautifully and wasn&apos;t needed. A first for Indian Cinema that is used to applying the same techniques and formula. The plot, cast and songs are exceptional. Everyone hits it out of the park.\n\nThis was Karan Johar&apos;s film debut and took the film world by storm with this well made film. Beside having a meaningful love story, it ended well and gave a lot of closure to the audience. The humor also pours out easily as does the drama, the film alternates well between these two. We see a great love story that was meant to be and learn of noble characters who make decisions for the greater good. \n\nThe theme is simply iconic, I will be bold and go as far to say it is as significant in Indian Cinema as Titanic was in Hollywood.",

      "reviewBody": "Karan Johar&apos;s Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is one of the most ravishing, grandiose and melodramatic Hindi films ever made. It is incredibly unrestrained and stormy in its emotional quotient, and yet so watchable, enjoyable and at times even pleasurable, that you can&apos;t but applaud to this spectacular show. It is one of the few films where overacting seems superb acting and overly melodramatic proceedings, despite being very cheesy and occasionally clichéd, become quite bearable. It combines realism and surrealism, comedy and heavy melodrama in a very unique style, which makes for an altogether colourful picture which is fun to watch.\n\nThe film is about relationships in family, about loving your parents and your family, about pride, values and regret. The well defined and written characters are used to create and present all these qualities. Even the least emotional scenes are accompanied by orchestrated violins, heavy piano and strikingly sad pictures on-screen. The film shows both the bright and dark sides of happy families, and while it never breaks new ground, never looks totally authentic, it is always entertaining in spite of its flaws. It depicts both the Indian traditional world and the western modern world and tries to bring them together in many instances.\n\nSome of the film&apos;s too emotional scenes could have been better edited and partly cut. The cinematography is good, the sets are extremely lavish, and the narrative is effectively laden with numerous songs and many memorable moments of comedy and drama. The comedy provides great relief and lightens the otherwise more-than-enough drama, and the music is extraordinary. My favourite song is &quot;Suraj Hua Maddham&quot;, a greatly melodious number wonderfully performed by Sonu Nigam and Alka Yagnik and extremely beautifully shot across some breathtaking locations. Needless to say, the chemistry between the two leads, Shahrukh Khan and Kajol, is as electrifying as ever.\n\nWhere acting goes, Amitabh Bachchan is restrained and displays well the hidden pain and the visible pride. Jaya Bachchan is superb as the subservient yet strong woman. Towards the end there is one very powerful scene in which she really stands out (you&apos;ll know which one). Shahrukh Khan in a typical, cynical and likable character, is great as always. Kajol utterly steals the show and proves her prowess as a gifted comedienne. She is hilarious in her comic scenes and equally shines in moments of drama. Her strong, charismatic presence is perhaps the best thing about this film. Farida Jalal provides excellent support. Hrithik and Kareena are unimpressive and inconsistent. Hrithik is over-expressive and far more emotional than required, and Kareena, while attractive and quite funny at times, badly overacts.\n\nAll in all, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham has bits of everything: drama, melodrama, romance and comedy, all presented wholeheartedly in true Hindi-film style with lots of tears and lots of fun. It is an example of Bollywood entertainment at its grandest, and works as such. This is a movie to be seen with one&apos;s family. Go for it.",

It is so good that there are not superlatives enough to do it credit.  The basic setup is that the principal characters, a mother, tantalizingly portrayed by Weaver, and her daughter, multifacetedly portrayed by Hewett, are &quot;artistes confidence&quot; to the core of their superficial existences.  They cannot so much as have &quot;lunch&quot; without practicing their arts of the scam, but mainly they work the old &quot;betrothal&quot; game.  Mom gets her rich mark to the alter, then even before the marriage can be consummated, the daughter, pretending to be unrelated, exploits the man&apos;s foolish libido, resulting in a substantial settlement after mom catches them apparently &quot;in flagrante.&quot;  But then things start going haywire when the daughter decides to strike out on her own, because the guy she fixes on as a mark is not like other guys at all.  How he is not, and how her character develops as a result, makes for two hours of outstanding comedy and drama."

      "reviewBody": "Coming into Speak No Evil, I was told this was one of the most disturbing movies of all time. It isn&apos;t, in my opinion. Maybe I&apos;m desensitized, because while there is a very terrifying and hard to watch sequence in this movie...there&apos;s only one, really. On some level, it&apos;s my own fault for listening to the hype, and I was somewhat disappointed the movie wasn&apos;t more intense.\n\nAlso, I can acknowledge that this movie is a, frustrating, experience to say the least. You know when you watch horror movies and scream at the screen for the characters to trust their instincts and LEAVE? Well yeah, this movie will annoy the hell out of you. (Of course, if the characters did the logical thing, the movie wouldn&apos;t happen.) I feel like there are cultural differences here too, which explains some of the character&apos;s behaviour.\n\nThat all being said, this is a good movie. It&apos;s extremely tense and uncomfortable, with a lot of the appeal coming from waiting for the shoe to drop.\n\nThe film follows a Danish family - Bjorn (Morten Burian) and Louisa (Sidsel Koch) who take up the invitation of a pleasant Dutch family they met on vacation to visit their home in the Dutch countrside. Normal stuff, until the Dutch hosts begin acting somewhat strange and begin testing the Danes&apos; social niceties and tolerance.\n\nAs the movie unfolds, it becomes almost unbearable as every cringe inducing moment seems like the one that will bring forth the inevitable horror. The movie does a good job setting up peaks and troughs, and even adding some complexity to the narrative. The men seem to share a bond, Bjorn, somewhat emasculated and timid, embraces the primal spontaneity and energy of his Dutch counter part, Patrick.\n\nAnd that&apos;s what elevates this movie from another paint-by-numbers thriller. The real message of the film, in my opinion, is an indictment of the Danish middle class, so removed from danger and hardship that their human survival instincts seem gone. That the Danes care so much about being polite that this is more important than removing themselves from a dangerous situation.\n\nI think it was deliberate that they meet a Dutch family, people from, as Bjorn says, &quot;a similar culture, more similar to them than the politically correct Swedes.&quot; It would&apos;ve been easy for an exotic foreigner to be the cause of such horror, but I think the film purposefully does this. It&apos;s also refreshing to see a film that doesn&apos;t treat masculinity as a toxic trait that must be excised. Instead, Speak No Evil puts forth the idea that a man who has lost his masculinity, to the extent that he can barely put up a fight in the face of death, is no man at all.\n\nSpeak No Evil is dark, depressing, thought provoking, and not for everyone. But it&apos;s a pretty neat little thriller, has some interesting ideas, and is a roller coaster. Check it out.",

      "name": "Five Word Review: Extraordinarily Acted Gritty Shakespearean Drama",
      "reviewBody": "William Shakespeare&apos;s most famous (and quotable) tragedy has not had a major big-screen adaptation that has stayed faithful to the play in many a year. Justin Kurzel&apos;s film attempts to provide a definitive cinematic version of the iconic play with this gritty, war-based work of drama starring Michael Fassbender (Oscar-nominated for &quot;12 Years a Slave, 2013) in the eponymous role and Marion Cotillard, who won the award for her role in Edith Piaf biopic &quot;La Vie en Rose,&quot; 2007. \n\nAs a quick word of warning: if you&apos;ve not read any Shakespeare, then I&apos;d advise you not to watch this film. Rife with Shakespearean language told through coarse Scottish accents, this is not a story easy to follow for those unfamiliar with it. Having studied the Scottish play in school, I can bring you up to speed if you&apos;re unaware - Macbeth is a Scottish thane (equivalent of a lord) who sees a premonition of witches after winning a battle. The witches&apos; prophecies trigger a spiral which sends Macbeth beyond sanity. And a character-based war drama is, in my opinion, the perfect direction to go in for a Macbeth adaptation. I always thought in school of what a good film Macbeth would be if made with sweeping battle scenes and a rough, gritty take on the tale. This is what Kurzel does, to great success. The first thing to note is the acting. Easily his best role (which is saying something,) Michael Fassbender portrays the flawed deterioration of the eponymous protagonist with gravitas yet often relatable humanity, even as his deeds become more and more ghastly (a scene with stakes is especially hard to watch.) It will be interesting to see how Fassbender&apos;s upcoming performance in Danny Boyle&apos;s Steve Jobs biopic compares to this. An Oscar nod is almost inevitable; it would be a travesty for him not to gain a nomination for this. Marion Cotillard is not to be over- shadowed in a role which would require a considerable lack of talent to play badly. Luckily the French actress has that talent in spades and at first she brings to the table hardened resolve before the true extent of Macbeth&apos;s madness is revealed and her acting changes accordingly with an impeccable change-over.\n\nAlso good is the haunting score and stunning Scottish scenery, bleak yet beautiful in a cold, austere way. The supporting turns from David Thewlis as King Duncan, Sean Harris as Macduff and Paddy Considine as Banquo are also all fantastic. In addition the ending is unexpected, but in a good way.\n\nThere&apos;s little bad to be said about the technique that went into the process of making Macbeth. The only things which detract are the admittedly shallow complaint that the dialogue, and therefore the story, is often hard to understand due to the coarse accents and antiquated language. This does sometimes have the effect of ruining scenes due to being taken out of it trying to understand the speech. Also, the slow motion is used rather poorly. Too much to be used effectively, with the slow motion lingering a little too long mid-battle, but not enough to be part of the visual style like Zack Snyder&apos;s 300. However, apart from this Justin Kurzel&apos;s Macbeth is a masterfully made film that may not win over those unfamiliar with the source material but will be a true treat for fans of Shakespeare and cinema. 79/100.",

      "reviewBody": "Banderas&apos; attempt at a sci-fi flick has great potential but it ultimately falls flat.\n\nIt&apos;s not because of the story. Although the trailer makes it clear that we&apos;re dealing with a recycled idea from Asimov&apos;s universe (robots that become more human than some humans), the movie barely scratches the surface of the issues at hand and chooses a middle path between a serious deep movie and an action flick and fails at both.\n\nBanderas&apos; character is the only one that interesting and it&apos;s easy to follow him and his point of view all the way from a corporate lackey to a guy involved in some ethical dilemmas. He acts well, way better than the movie average.\n\nThe first problem is that there aren&apos;t any other well-drawn characters. Everyone else is flat, starting from his family, his boss and his opponents. To call them one-dimensional is giving them too much credit, I would say they are soulless and at some point I was really hoping for them to just die and leave us with the robots and Banderas. I can&apos;t fault the actors much, it&apos;s the script that didn&apos;t give them any chance.\n\nThe second problem is the plot. Although the story has potential, the plot fails at acquiring it. It won&apos;t take long to see that at some point the actions of the &apos;bad guys&apos; really stop making sense, they are there just as a really poor excuse for some lame attempts at action sequences (I&apos;m not going to detail this as to not give spoilers, suffice to say that the main pretext for the confrontation between the bad guys and Banderas is not necessary at all, if you stop to think about it for a minute given the situation of the humans in the movie and whatnot). \n\nThe last one is the soundtrack. It&apos;s absolutely atrocious and the sound doesn&apos;t fit with the images at all, especially the music sequences. \n\nI will admit that the movie is entertaining for the most part. But that&apos;s it. It wastes an amazing potential, fails to explore itself and just throws some lines and some action at you that lacks logic, common sense and characters (save for Banders and the robots).",

      "reviewBody": "First off let me say that Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner were the perfect choices for this movie! They both gave electric powerful performances and really proved themselves as fine artists. They have awesome chemistry too, we first saw that in Romancing the Stone, but their chemistry in The War of the Roses is a very different kind of chemistry. Yeah sure in the first 15 minutes it shows them making passionate love and becoming infatuated with one another, then comes the kiddies, but really this film is not at all about love, this is NOT a romance story. No it&apos;s a movie about an extremely bitter married couple going through a divorce. Neither of the two are willing to give up the elegant nice house they live in. So thus the war begins. &quot;The gloves are off&quot; as Douglas&apos;s character states at one point in the film. The script is very well written, it doesn&apos;t waste any time or drag on, it entertains the entire runtime, there was not a single moment. Danny DeVito is a talented actor and director, he proves that in this film. Both his acting and his directing are both great. The events that happen throughout the film are bitter and full of anger, but it&apos;s very interesting to watch. It runs deep in character development, a movie like this would have to in order to be successful. The movie is not one to view for a &quot;feel good&quot; mood or for when you want something sweet and romantic.

      "reviewBody": "With the resurgence of the raunchy teen comedy, now seems like as good a time as ever to go back and study its roots. What kinds of films influenced American Pie and Road Trip? It is easy to point out films like Porky&apos;s, Animal House and Fasttimes, but somewhere forgotten in all this is Jeff Kanew&apos;s hilarious flick REVENGE OF THE NERDS. This is not only entertaining and funny, but it contains what has to be considered a blue print for success in campus comedy. Take lots of people getting drunk, jocks ostracizing nerds from there way of life, the weak rising up to take back what is just as much a right as it is to others, and of course lots of nudity featuring an abundance of gorgeous women. What you have here is a great recipe for success.\n\nWhat made Revenge work is that it didn&apos;t try to pretend to be something that it wasn&apos;t. This was an exploitive sex-fest and it worked well. What it also had was a funny script and one that we could all relate to. I mean, who hasn&apos;t felt left out or relegated to the side lines while someone else gets all the glory? Besides being extremely funny, this film touched on something that we all can relate to.\n\nRevenge of the Nerds is another of the teen films that was hilarious and it ended up spawning a slew of sequels. Avoid them and see this one again. It&apos;s worth it, especially if you were a teen when it came out. And if you are a teen now, this is a treat to watch. This is one of the films that writers study when they are thinking what they can put into their film to make it crude, rude and raunchy. This should be a must see!\n\n9 out of 10",

Direction is strong throughout, make-up is great as well.\n\nThe script isn&apos;t perfect: it contains some clichés and a few unrealistic moments that break immersion. However, it also manages to surprise, offering unexpected turns that keep the viewer engaged. A few surrealistic scenes stand out as bold and imaginative highlights.\n\nThe performances are excellent. Dave Franco delivers the most compelling and memorable performance. Kristen Stewart also shines as the lead, once again proving herself to be a remarkable actress.\n\nThe film&apos;s main weakness is its villain, who feels boring. Still, that shortcoming doesn&apos;t overshadow the film&apos;s many strengths.\n\nIn the end, it&apos;s a rewarding watch - flawed at points but ambitious, and elevated by its visuals, direction, and cast.\n\nIt is definitely something different and original :)\n\nFinal Score: 7/10."

This movie was fun to watch. Of course there are many jokes about how these people have cones for heads, but that is the title of the movie, so no complaints warranted there.

As someone who has been warned time and time again about the dangers of using supernatural means to attempt to contact the dead, I found this movie to be highly entertaining in a cheap-thrills kind of way.\n\nIf you are looking for a simple, cliché supernatural themed movie to watch with close friends for a movie night, I&apos;d definitely recommend. This movie is neither terribly unbearable nor disgustingly gory, and as such I feel is relatively inoffensive to those who enjoy these themes in their movies.",

      "reviewBody": "Everything Is Illuminated A young Jewish American searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape Nazi persecution while embarking on a cross-European tour with some unlikely associates.\n\nLiev Schreiber makes his directorial debut with a playful angst usually associated with his acting ethos. When successful actors decide to sit in the director&apos;s chair, we usually get a biographical glimpse at the souls beneath the acting mask- Check. We usually get a mishmash of genres- Check. But what we normally do not get is an insightful original film which is credible, intelligent and moving.\n\nElijah Wood plays Jonathan, an inquisitive young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes. He is on a mission to find a woman in a photograph. The sepia picture bears his grandfather (an uncanny resemblance to him) and the woman. To aid his journey he enlists the help of travel guides that comprise of a Hip-Hop loving break-dancer, Alex (Eugene Hutz), his apathetic and perma-vexed grandfather (Boris Leskin) and his dog- Sammy Davis Junior Jr! What ensues is essentially a comedy. There is an un-patronisingly simple introduction with voice-overs. Alex&apos;s is especially funny as he educates his younger brother on the year 1969, proving how popular he is with the chicks and break-dancing thus setting him up as Jonathan&apos;s antithesis.\n\nSchreiber begins to break down the characters as they progress and the comedy acts as an intentional veil to what is a story about three people linked to the holocaust who do not really know themselves. All three hold the film with tenderness and authenticity something Schreiber was unlikely to get wrong and as enchanting and fantastical as the film is, the horrors that are allowed to crack through, i.e. the past are presented in an almost palatable tone (incidental music, cinematography) which make them all the more unsettling.\n\nAs the unlikely group finally find the town they seek they learn of the true atrocities that occurred and find out a lot about who they really are.\n\nElijah wood is as authentic as usual, bringing his usual innocence and strength to the screen. Formally a resident good in Lord of the Rings and a resident evil in Sin City he plays Jonathan with aplomb as he is bombarded with culture shocks and a quest for truth. Boris Leskin as the grandfather also delivers his angst and frustration at the youths with great humour and conviction as his own past is unravelled. However, it is Eugene Hutz as Alex that makes the show. The director using that old trade of translation misunderstandings to create and maintain a humour that is actually funny and not gimmicky.\n\nSchreiber has delivered an enchanting debut that has both heart and soul. The continuous score and beautiful photography creates a fairy tale haze around a story about identity, truth and family. If there was a complaint, it would be the speed at which the film changes direction; though this could have been intentional it may not sit well with all. Nevertheless this is a sterling effort that delivers great comedy and bonding between an unlikely group while dissecting another aspect of the horrors of World War 2 in a completely fresh fashion.\n\n-Chi&amp;Ojo",

Though India helped Bangladesh but the war was between East Pakistan vs West Pakistan for the independence. Bangladeshi people&apos;s fought and gave their bloods to achieve the independence. Anyone can use wiki or google to know about the history of 1971&apos;s war in Bangladesh and how Bangladesh born. So the movie has a full fake starting with a wrong history.",

This movie like most new movies is very fast paced, and witty with the word play and sarcastic tones that some characters had. The lead roles were chosen wonderfully. Anton Yelchin (Odd) in one of his maybe breakout rolls. I&apos;d hope to see him play more lead roles very soon as he is a great actor, you can even tell by his large amount of upcoming movies in 2013 and 14. DaFoe was outstanding as he much always is, his character had bits and pieces it would seem from his role as the main Detective of The Boondock Saints. The supporting roles were great, and there&apos;s a twist at the end that caught me off guard.\n\nGreat movie!",

People said that no-one could make a better Don than the man himself, Amitabh Bachchan. However, I would like to disagree. Shahrukh is the only actor of todays time that could ever make it better than the original. His style, charisma and witty remarks make it all the more appealing. Farhan Akhtar&apos;s superb directing made this film epic! There are no gaps, no over-the-top parts. As a director Farhan&apos;s best film ever. Film&apos;s background score is stunning. But the songs are not pretty good. The film&apos;s visual effects is better than MI-4, Ra.One, Robot, Krissh. It&apos;s stunning and well shot. The special effects add a special flavor to the film which makes it even more delicious. Each and every character in this film is perfect. But in some portion it remembers me Death Race2, specially in Jail. Anyway best movie of the year.",

To his surprise, he finds that this planet is inhabited by little green people who are happily living in a white picket fence world, and whose only fear is that it will be overrun by alien invaders...like Chuck! This film is made from the alien perspective. They are like the 50&apos;s Earth, they have the hippie guy, the youngsters who are open to new ideas that aliens are friendly. Frankly, I liked the film even though it wasn&apos;t epic or adventurous enough. This is a film made for the kids have a great time &amp; I know they&apos;ll enjoy this. The thing I didn&apos;t like was that the love story between Neera &amp; Lem seemed to be forced. Planet 51 is the hometown &amp; Chuck the human astronaut is the alien in this film. It was funny at times &amp; I think every youngster can relate to something in the film &amp; the old timers can get a kick out of the 50&apos;s feeling.\n\nI liked how it rained rocks &amp; how the evil doctor laughed. Everything about the storyline is about the 50&apos;s. Even they have The Humaniacs horror film that is considered scary for their generation. The premise of the plot is great, they could have made it better. The voice actors Dwayne Johnson (Chuck), Justin Long (Lem) &amp; Neera (Jessica Biel) all did a good job. You&apos;ll enjoy this if you watch this with some kids.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Yes, it is funny. Just like when Bill Maher is funny. Often but not always. One of the things I like about Maher is that behind every derogatory outburst there is, usually, a real thinking process. In his &quot;Religulous&quot; he commits a startling mistake. He doesn&apos;t allow the possibility of &quot;faith&quot; as a positive not even by mistake. Agree that organized religion has been monstrous in so many different instances that it is a bit of a miracle that it survives but there is also the other side, the positive strength that faith provides and it does in so many different and powerful ways. The one sided views are always annoying and &quot;Religulous&quot; sins of that. I did laugh though, God forgive me.",

It was great to see him back on the big screen as feisty as ever still kicking butt. The villain was played by Paul Bettany who is always brilliant when playing a dirty rotten scoundrel. I didn&apos;t realize how tall he (Paul) is until this movie, (he is a good inch taller than Harrison Ford, who is over 6 ft) The film was a bit slow in parts, but the ending makes up for it. I wouldn&apos;t suggest taking small children as it is a bit violent for its PG-13 rating. There are also a couple funny / cute moments that were really well played. If you are a Harrison Ford fan, you won&apos;t want to miss Firewall.",

      "reviewBody": "Erin (Drew Barrymore) is getting a late start on her dreams. At 31, she&apos;s finally finishing college with an internship at a New York newspaper. With just six weeks to go before returning to San Francisco to complete her education, she meets Garrett (Justin Long) over a classic game of Centipede.\n\nWith similar quirky senses of humor and more than a little disarming honesty, the two quickly pair up. From the beginning, they know that any relationship they have is limited to the next month and a half, so they promise to keep it light and casual. It doesn&apos;t work.\n\nSix weeks later, Erin is packed to leave, and Garrett is pretending that&apos;s okay. Despite their best efforts, the two are soon burning up the phone lines between the coasts. Erin&apos;s sister, Corinne (Christina Applegate) is dismayed knowing that a relationship over such a distance is hard. In fact, it&apos;s all but impossible.\n\nThe plot seems very simplistic and I suppose that it is. But Garrett&apos;s eccentric roommate Dan (Charlie Day) and Erin&apos;s sister&apos;s personality quirks add real spice to most scenes, and the very real chemistry between the main characters (Barrymore and Long have had a real life on-off-on relationship) transcends the simplicity and makes Going the Distance something more.\n\nBarrymore, as always, is capable, and her innate sweetness shines out from the screen. Long, perhaps best known as the &quot;Mac guy&quot; on those infamous Mac/PC commercials, proves an able partner. Day is good, and though Applegate&apos;s role is limited, she steals her scenes almost across the board. Look also for Jim Gaffigan in a small supporting part as Corinne&apos;s husband. His deadpan delivery is perfect.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Going the Distance was amusing without question. But what made it a good movie was the fact that, for all the genuine laughs, it quite simply rang true.\n\nPOLITICAL NOTES: None.\n\nFAMILY SUITABILITY: Going the Distance is rated R for &quot;sexual content including dialogue, language throughout, some drug use and brief nudity.&quot; While this is not a movie for small children, the tenderness with which the central relationship is played and the integrity and genuine caring portrayed by each half of the central couple wouldn&apos;t be a bad lesson for teens to learn. I&apos;d say this film is okay for teens 14 and up.",

I don&apos;t know what&apos;s up with the kids these days they don&apos;t seem to understand Jack diddly squat 50 Moskowitz was my hero lol. How dare you write this a 6.8 lol I&apos;m gonna write it at 10 just so it offsets and gets a better review lol coming to America. This is a true story one of the very few Walt Disney movies that I do enjoy and I like and not understood why it got such a bad review from other people. Anyways, not much more I can say about this just go ahead and watch it and you will love it because I do.",

This is a tremendously entertaining film that shouldn&apos;t be viewed as a horror film, but rather, as a tongue-in-cheek western, in the vain of the Spaghetti Westerns.  You all have to pull your heads out and watch this film again...in about nine years.  I&apos;ll bet you&apos;ll say, &quot;You know what, that was a hell of a lot of fun.&quot;  In the meantime, get off Carpenter&apos;s ass."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ladder 49&quot; is by no means a bad movie and as a matter of fact, it&apos;s a professionally made production, with some good actors in it, but it&apos;s just that everything in the movie is very formulaic and all the typical clichés you could expect in a movie about firefighters are present here. The movie has no real surprises in it and because of that none of the emotions come over as real. Also compared to &quot;Backdraft&quot;, this movie is totally obsolete. It adds nothing to the firefighter movie genre (..as if that even is a genre). &quot;Ladder 49&quot; and &quot;Backdraft&quot; are two similar movies in several ways but &quot;Backdraft&quot; is the better one simply because it has better emotions, character building and sequences featuring fire. It however is of course not fair to compare this two movie just simply because they both are about firefighters. I understand that &quot;Ladder 49&quot; and &quot;Backdraft&quot; are two different movie made with different intentions. However &quot;Ladder 49&quot; is self to blame for this constant comparisons. It copies elements and scene&apos;s from &quot;Backdraft&quot; and obviously tries to top the movie in every way possible. Mission failed though...\n\nThe storytelling isn&apos;t done in the best way. The non-linear storytelling wasn&apos;t the best choice for this movie. If the story was told in a more &apos;normal&apos; way, the emotions and the ending would perhaps had worked better for me. I wasn&apos;t exactly grabbed by the story and its character and both were lacking. Not really the actors fault, blame it on the cliché filled script instead. It&apos;s obvious that the movie makers wanted to portray the firefighters as true heroes. If the script hadn&apos;t been filled with so many clichés, they might had succeeded in this.\n\nThe fire sequences were nicely made but to be honest they weren&apos;t anything thrilling or exciting. The true essence of the movie is on the characters and the dramatic moments but since the movie isn&apos;t exactly successful in this, the movie as a whole also quite isn&apos;t.\n\nThe musical score by William Ross was better than anticipated and Joaquin Phoenix is a wonderful actor. This truly were the two best elements of the movie.\n\nNicely made but as a movie not original enough and because of that also quite pointless. Just watch the Ron Howard movie &quot;Backdraft&quot; instead.\n\n6/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

She is surely one of the most hypnotic, mysterious actresses ever to grace the screen.\n\nShe has a raw, down to earth beauty, which fits in perfectly with the film&apos;s setting - The Paris underground: airport hangers, parking lots, alleys and seedy nightclubs.\n\nNever has Paris been shown in this light.\n\nThe film perfectly shows the disillusionment of a stranger in a foreign place.\n\nThe film also has a few nice touches which might be missed by a casual viewer, such as Harrison Ford&apos;s characters increasingly pathetic returns to his hotel as he grows increasingly &quot;frantic&quot;. At the beginning of the film he is a respected doctor, but as Paris begins to take its toll on him he ends up a shoeless, crazed mess followed everywhere by a drug-crazed punkette.\n\nAll in all, Polanski&apos;s definitive film and a mega-hit that never was."

The most impressive thing was at the end. Everybody left the theatre in complete silence. People were touched and had tears in their eyes. This movie moves people. It is a story so close to reality and so well played by the actors. One really hates Mary Tyler-Moore at the end for being a bitch first class, a mother with no feelings for her youngest son. Judd Hirsch is very funny in acting as a psychologist. He plays it so naturally as if he had seen one for several years. In my opinion Robert Redford directed his best movie ever in Ordinary People.",

So happy this director trusted his vision enough to not let it be butchered by the studio. I would have loved to see this in theaters.\n\nI think the pacing was awesome. Some people are saying it was too slow but I think the time it took to get us more indepth with each character paid off. If you really enjoy a good film and don&apos;t need action packed explosions to keep your attention, you will really appreciate this film.\n\nI am now a fan of this writer/director as I don&apos;t find many who get it right. Often these writer/director films go off kilter and don&apos;t have the right checks and balances. This guy should be given the steering wheel more often and trusted whole heartedly by the studios.",

Some scenes in the film are incredibly atmospheric, and they will be forever burned in your mind. The film captures a human sense of achievement, drive and determination better than any other film I know.

Overall not anything to get that excited about. But the action sequences, both when Peter is captured and the film ending hostage rescue sequence in my opinion are some of the greatest and most accurate in film. Not perfect, this is a movie so some creative/dramatic license was taken, but way above par compared to most any other film I can think of with very rare exception. Its pretty clear that they had a rare combination of fantastic military consultants along with a director and cinematographer willing to listen and make the most of it. Tactics, equipment, effects (with obligatory gasoline added to explosions...), even hand signals, how the guerrilla&apos;s operate... Spot on! Quite the rarity and very refreshing.\n\nReally can&apos;t say enough good things about the action sequences. Movie is worth seeing just for this. The rest... meh.",

      "name": "An effective and thought provoking thriller thanks to Cheadle",
      "reviewBody": "A few years ago, Don Cheadle rose to the top of the acting world with dynamite performances in Hotel Rwanda, the Ocean&apos;s series, Crash, and Traffic. He even got to fight in Rush Hour 2! So it should come as no surprise that Cheadle is electrifying and deep in this film, and it is his performance that makes the film what it is: a deeply engrossing political thriller that will definitely make the audience think about the movie, and of course, the current state of affairs in our world.\n\nTraitor did a very good job of stepping on the audience&apos;s toes with some lines that could&apos;ve been considered prejudiced, and then catching themselves with actual truths about the war in the Middle East, in addition to religions themselves. This obviously takes place in the dialog of the characters, particularly those of Cheadle and Guy Pearce. The film&apos;s dialog is well written, making up for the sometimes slow pacing scenes that take awhile to transpire.\n\nI&apos;ve already heaped my praise on Don Cheadle, but I&apos;ll do it a little bit more. One of the crucial plot points is the true allegiance of his character, and it is the subtlety of his performance that will keep you guessing what side he is fighting for, though when the answer is finally revealed, you&apos;ll think you knew all along. Some call this &apos;predictable&apos;. I call it great acting. Guy Pearce delivers a winner of a show as well as the straight edge FBI agent chasing after Cheadle, though his character has been done to death, to be honest. Neal McDonough is somewhat annoying in a supporting role as Pearce&apos;s partner (though I think Neal is annoying anyway...), while Jeff Daniels is a nice addition to the team. I thought another great performance came from Said Taghmaoui, as Cheadle&apos;s terrorist partner. After one of the better villainous performances of the year in Vantage Point, Taghmaoui delivers a performance just as deep and riveting as Cheadle&apos;s. This guy is one of the more underrated performers around, and he should get more work outside of being a terrorist.\n\nI like the character development within the script, but I have some issues with the pacing of the film, which I&apos;ll take up with our director. The film seemed slow at times, as I was constantly waiting for a particular moment to happen, while 5 pacing scenes would come in the way like a roadblock and just aggravate me a bit. It&apos;s nitpicking, but some of the action was a little nauseating because of the camera. STAND STILL, YO! A decent plot twist within the ending of the film doesn&apos;t hurt at all, and adds a great element of surprise and depth to some characters.\n\nAll in all, Traitor is definitely worth a watch if you&apos;re looking to see something different to escape what is usually the graveyard for films...August. Cheadle&apos;s performance alone is worth the ticket. Taghmaoui&apos;s as well.",

      "reviewBody": "Excellent film. I&apos;d never heard of the book it&apos;s based on. The movie does have the kind of complex characters that are more associated with novels than with cinema.\n\nIt&apos;s Hitchcockian to some extent - its premise is a classic &quot;wrong-man&quot; scenario, with suspense, humour and chase sequences. But the de rigeur romantic element here is, for the most part, tinged with a strange melancholy , and it&apos;s this that gives the film such an unusual atmosphere.\n\nLeading man François Cluzet is probably weary of being compared to Dustin Hoffman, but the fact is there is more than a passing resemblance. Nevertheless, Cluzet is very much his own man, and is as good, if not better, than the Hoffman of, say, &apos;Marathon Man&apos;, which inevitably comes to mind as one watches Cluzet taking to his heels in the breathless, breathtaking chase sequence.\n\nAlthough Cluzet carries the movie, the rest of the cast, which contains a number of very distinguished French actors, is first-rate.\n\nThe plot is full of twists and turns, and the story-telling full of time-jumps, so you really need to concentrate. I&apos;ll need to get the DVD to check I understood it right.\n\nAll in all, it&apos;s an excellent edge-of-your-seat thriller: a splendid, somewhat scary, night out at the movies.",

      "reviewBody": "Red, White and Royal Blue\n\nThis queer romantic comedy tells the story of a British prince falling in love with the son of an American president, and the roads they travel as they explore this love.\n\nThis movie is very reminiscent of the queer teen series, Young Royals, especially with the similar themes both portray, but Red, White and Royal Blue has characters that are more aged.\n\nTaylor Zakhar Perez and Nicholas Galitzine are brimming with cute and endearing chemistry, making this romcom very enjoyable and believable. The progression from enemies to friends and eventual lovers was a bit fast, but each stage has memorable moments. The supporting cast was also good, especially Sarah Shahi and Uma Thurman (the coming-out scene between her and Taylor Perez was very memorable and sweet), but some of their characters could have been fleshed out better.\n\nHaving not read the book, I can&apos;t state how faithful it was to it, and if this adaptation is better or worse. But there were some resolutions I felt weren&apos;t done, like Nick&apos;s journalist friend not getting his comeuppance. The movie would have fared better if it was a mini-series. There&apos;s also a sort of imbalance that occurs in the sex/romantic scenes, the scenes before the Paris hotel scene have a Disneyesque tame feel to them, and then the Paris hotel scene packs in beautiful smut.\n\nRed, White and Royal Blue is an easy and enjoyable watch, and should definitely please romcom lovers.\n\n6.5-7/10.",

It&apos;s incessantly preachy and shallow, clinically moving from plot point to plot point while never examining any of its characters or happenings beneath the surface level.\n\nGranted, it doesn&apos;t necessarily need to. But it also doesn&apos;t present its scant narrative with enough style to make it compulsively watchable.\n\nStill, I found it impossible to dislike this movie. It tells the populist story that united everyone-right, left, and center-for a brief moment of euphoric social harmony. How can I not get wrapped up in reliving all that?\n\nMost of the cast brings charisma to their characters that was not on the page, and they are what is compelling about this film. That, and, even though the script has a dearth of insight, it&apos;s funny. It had loads of fast-paced dry wit that make it tough to not smile throughout.\n\nThe performers and the humour really saved this movie, and though I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll have the impact the filmmakers were hoping for, it&apos;s a solidly good time. Just don&apos;t take it too seriously.",

Since the 2000&apos;s, Comedy legend Eddie Murphy has become a more goofy but fun family friendly movie star as he&apos;s moved onto big budget family films like &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; &amp; &quot;I Spy&quot; &amp; &quot;Meet Dave&quot; &amp; &quot;Dr. Doolittle 2&quot; &amp; the &quot;Shrek&quot; films, so Murphy has become a new Comedy star for a new generation of kids which is nice &amp; has kept his Career very much alive &amp; relevant. I&apos;ve enjoyed pretty much most of his films &amp; Murphy always cheers me up. My favourite Eddie Murphy movie would have to be his 90&apos;s Comedy CLASSIC &quot;The Nutty professor&quot; &amp; i loved it&apos;s goofy-silly sequel &amp; I&apos;ve got big Nostalgia love for the first &quot;Dr. Doolittle&quot; film, but hey i like most of his films. This big budget supernatural fantasy family comedy-adventure is another great film to add to your Eddie Murphy collection. &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; is a beautiful looking film with some of the best &amp; detailed products design I&apos;ve ever seen in a movie, especially in a family comedy!!! The huge Haunted Mansion set is absolutely beautiful &amp; visually stunning with gorgeous cinematography. The special effects are fantastic as this is a huge mega budget Disney production, so everything looks spectacular &amp; the best of the best, like the Zombie scene that is done like a proper Horror movie sequence with fantastic looking Zombies created by legendary movie effects master, Rick Baker.\n\nThe simple story is about a busy realter (Eddie Murphy) &amp; his family are summoned to a massive old mansion &amp; discover it&apos;s haunted &amp; must try to solve the mystery of the mansion. Also it&apos;s about Jim Evers (Murphy) realising he&apos;s been neglecting his family &amp; wants to be there more &amp; take them on an adventure but of course they end up at the &quot;Haunted Mansion&quot; it&apos;s a nice sweet funny family film but also a really great supernatural adventure with Horror elements. There&apos;s still a heart &amp; that sweet Disney magic toward the end but it all plays out nicely. If you like Horror movies then this is a really nice watered-down version, thats still rich with stunning gothic scenery &amp; a real spooky atmosphere complete with a rain storm &amp; lightening. The Ghost effects are Awesome &amp; very glowing &amp; colourful.\n\nA great fun ghostly fantasy comedy with a great Eddie Murphy. One of Murphy&apos;s best &quot;Family&quot; films.",

      "reviewBody": "I will start out by saying that I really do love this movie, but I&apos;m not here to rant and rave about it. This movie is fascinating to me because I do love the skate culture and seeing a movie about characters who started modern skating was, as I said, fascinating. However, I realize that most of the world doesn&apos;t think that. With that in mind, I will continue. This movie is not a documentary about skating!!! If you want a documentary then check out Dogtown and Z-Boys directed by a Z-boy himself. It is full of stories about how the Zephyr team came to be and the way life was in Venice Beach at the time. I personally love the documentary as well, but Lords of Dogtown is not meant to be a Hollywood representation of the documentary. If you are looking for that, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! Lords of Dogtown is meant to be a story about the characters that fills in the gaps the documentary leaves about how these people felt, mainly Jay Adams, Stacy Peralta, and Tony Alva. The camera angles are not straightforward, the cinematography is rough, and its not a cookie cutter film. But that, in my opinion, is why it works so well. A lot of the Z-Boys themselves were on staff for this movie and helped to make it as authentic as it could be while still holding the attention of movie-goers. These guys were very impressed with the way the film was produced and, for the most part, were very pleased with how it represented the time. If you love skate culture then chances are you will fall in love with this movie like I did. Even my parents, who are definitely not into the skate culture or the 70&apos;s, still enjoyed this movie and were interested about the documentary afterwards. This movie definitely made me more interested in what skating was all about and I can&apos;t get enough about these guys now. I highly recommend this movie as well as Dogtown and Z-Boys.",

If it&apos;s at all possible for you to put aside comparisons to Kubrick&apos;s film, you should do so. 2001 certainly didn&apos;t need a sequel but, if it had to have one, it couldn&apos;t be much better than this. The story has Dr. Heywood Floyd (now played by Roy Scheider) joining a Russian mission to investigate the events of the first film. Basically the movie tries to spell out what happened in 2001 for everybody who didn&apos;t get it and provide some degree of closure to the story. It&apos;s a different movie than 2001 and, in some ways, a more accessible one. I say that knowing how many people hate 2001 for the very reasons many others (including myself) love it. The script here is not as enigmatic and the direction is less artful. The cast is very good and the special effects are excellent. It&apos;s not the experience Kubrick&apos;s masterpiece is but it is an enjoyable companion piece. Not necessary in any way but good nonetheless.",

I am now almost 19 years old here in 2004 and I gotta watch this movie once in a while to recapture the good ol&apos; days of my childhood. This movie is indeed really cute and good for the whole family. I remember my cousin borrowed it from me and I did not get it back for nearly three years because she loved the movie to death. I am just glad to see that some of kids have somewhat of a career after this. I was wondering what happened to Darla, Alfalfa and the gang. It&apos;s hard to believe that most of the Rascals are now high schoolers and growing up. As I write this review, I have an urge to watch the movie again. 10/10...loved it as a kid and as a young adult, I still love it!"

I&apos;ve read reviews on this movie and saying that this was just another Hollywood movie. Their wrong! I watched this movie and I was really impressed by it. For me it was truly inspirational. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent in this movie. There are some who says that Michelle isn&apos;t  tough enough to play the character, but sorry to burst their bubble but it&apos;s called acting. You can be the weakest person on earth but if your truly a good actor then you can make anyone believe your a tough guy or girl. The music was awesome.  The cast was great. The Plot and script was exceptional. I recommend this movie to anyone. You wont be disappointed. I sure wasn&apos;t."

      "reviewBody": "What unlikely trio to fall in love with, just as unlikely as the landscape. When a movie fits so well without a tag that links it to anything else in its historic film context, it can only be described as a happy accident. Premeditated for sure, but accident nonetheless. Terence Stamp, is an actor with a spectacular career. Varied and surprising. It defies description, but let me try. Peter Ustinov&apos;s &quot;Billy Budd&quot; William Wyler&apos;s &quot;The Collector&quot; Federico Fellini&apos;s &quot;Spirit of the Dead&quot; John Schlesinger&apos;s &quot;Far From The Madding Crowd&quot; Pier Paolo Pasolini&apos;s &quot;Teorema&quot; Joseph Losey&apos;s &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; Oliver Stone&apos;s &quot;Wall Street&quot; Stephen Frear&apos;s &quot;The Hit&quot; Richard Donner&apos;s &quot;Superman&quot; &quot;Steven Sodebergh&apos;s &quot;The Limey&quot; Am I making my point? He is an actor for all seasons, beautiful beyond belief to boot. In &quot;The Adventures of Pricilla Queen of The Desert&quot; he unveils another unexpected side to his considerable talents. A Woman. And what a woman, a Meryl Streep with a past and, thanks to director Stephan Elliot, with a future. Dressed by geniuses. More human than ever. He is flanked by two spectacular Aussies. Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) giving a performance of such tenderness that even my brother in law, a homophobic macho man of the first order,loved him. And Guy Pearce (L A Confidential) He is such a beautiful,sexy, funny girl that made me long for a her/he all to myself. Some other monstrously cloned movies were rushed into production trying to capitalize on the success of Pricilla. They all failed miserably and rightly so. Frank Capra, accepting his AFI Lifetime Achievement Award sent a profound and heartfelt advise to young filmmakers. &quot;Don&apos;t follow trends, start new ones&quot; Well done Mr Elliot. Well done.",

      "reviewBody": "A few years ago, A Separation won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. This Iranian movie was exquisitely acted and director Asghar Farhadi must have been justifiably proud of his work at the helm. Not surprisingly, another one of Farhadi&apos;s films has just been released to theaters in the States. However, oddly, it&apos;s actually a film he made before A Separation! About Elly is from 2009 and once again features superb acting.\n\nThe film is set during a holiday in Iran. A group of friends have decided on a brief trip together and are using it to try to set up their friend, Ahmad, with a pretty young lady named Elly. Most of these friends don&apos;t know Elly--but Sepideh does and thinks she&apos;ll be a good match for the guy. The first portion of the film seems pretty mundane with the usual banter you&apos;d expect during a holiday getaway. However, things turn dark when one of the small children nearly drowns. The boy is saved but after the confusion dies down, everyone starts to wonder where Elly got to. Perhaps she jumped in the water to try to save the boy and drowned herself or perhaps she just left. After all, she DID insist on going home the following morning...and it was the following morning when the boy nearly died. What&apos;s next? See the film.\n\nThis movie is an interesting character study as well as a cautionary tale about lies and half-truths. Once again, Farhadi did a wonderful job with the film and the actors really deserve kudos for their realistic performances. In particular, I noticed that the children really seemed scared when they should have been and the adults later begin to show definite signs of stress. It was hard to tell that they were really acting--as if Farhadi actually did something to the actress playing Elly!\n\nDespite my loving the acting and direction, I&apos;ll admit that this is certainly not a film for everyone. Some folks don&apos;t like films with subtitles, some will find the subject matter a bit too mundane and some might be a bit put off by the ending. I didn&apos;t mind the first two minor concerns but I, too, thought the ending was perhaps a bit weak. Still, the film is a marvelous showcase for the folks involved and deserves to be seen. Well worth your time if you can find it in your local theaters--which isn&apos;t always easy with foreign language movies.",

Mark Wahlberg is great to look at (so is Reese Witherspoon for the guys) and the story - though done before - is very engaging and watchable. The chemistry between David and Nicole before he goes wacko is great, too. I recommend this as a good film to rent for a &quot;night with the girls&quot; or if you are just in the mood for a thriller with real good looking people. Plus, Fox seems to put this movie on TV twice a year, as it was just on last night, and was on in August of &apos;99. ENJOY!!"

Some will tell you it&apos;s passé,corny ,old hat :they are completely right.This movie can only appeal to these who have often a look at the past of the seventh art:I&apos;m one of them and I do like &quot;the majestic&quot;."

The Samaritin is a decent movie, but with no hero/villian devopment at all it&apos;s hard to make the mental jump. There just isn&apos;t enough laid down in the back story for you to really care about any of the characters. It&apos;s not a bad movie idea, and plays into an older Stallone pretty well, but its just not excuted well at all.\n\nEverything seemed rushed and unppaslable. The kid was okay, looked a bit like a young river Phenoix but without the acting chops.\n\nThe Villian was a Bane from &quot;The dark Knight rises&quot; wannabe.. This is an entertaining and decent film, with Sly giving great one line advice and good action scenes. But ultimately, it&apos;s nothing new and a bit awkward.\n\n6 out of ten.",

This is probably my favourite film in the last 12 months so hence the need to say my bit. There is a wonderful, powerful, visceral quality to this film which is extremely rare in any art-form (lets be honest), so credit needs to be placed where credit is due - and it is due in huge amounts here. &apos;Head On&apos; takes you on an emotional journey to the edges of the human experience, tempered by an nihilism and a soul-searching despair that feels all too real. These are not so much characters but real people with real dilemma&apos;s, and their life experiences oozes from every visible pore. The two central performances are bloody amazing and a reminder of what real acting (and characterisation) is all about. The direction is profound, not to mention the wonderful soundtrack (the Birthday Party track much appreciated!!). I can&apos;t say anything but complimentary things about this film and in my humble opinion is a modern-day masterpiece. On the small off-chance that the actors/producers/ director or anyone connected to this film reads this, congratulations on a fantastic piece of film-making!",

      "reviewBody": "Mmmmm.... mugwump jizz\n\nThemes:  Substance addiction and how physically self-conscious it makes our protagonist feel, the creativity forced by imprisonment (a direct reference to real-life events between Burroughs, his wife, his subsequent incarceration and his heroin/acid issues), the sense of betrayal as more surprise than malice and of course the inevitable interface between Dave and Bill at the pelvic level.\n\nThe effects work is pre render-mation latex and sufficiently restrained to allow your imagination to back-fill the appropriate horror/fascination/titillation for the moment.  Don&apos;t try to figure out which you =should= feel or to mentally sort it out, that&apos;d rob you of the fun; it&apos;s the psychic and emotional disarray that makes it so compelling.\n\nPeter Weller is suitably deadpan, allowing only a sparkle of the playful poet to shine through from time to time (the story about the Duke du Vantra&apos;s Espano-Suiza made me howl); he must have spent a few =fun= hours with Burroughs himself to get the role down.\n\nIf you liked Cronenburg&apos;s smarter stuff, such as Dead Ringers, you&apos;ll love this.  If you&apos;ve read Kerouac, Ginsberg or Burroughs in particular, I promise you&apos;ll love it.  If you&apos;re not into exploratory literature, have issues with distasteful realities of poverty or have a personal affection for the quality works of Stallone, Willis and Schwarzenegger - you&apos;ll hate it.\n\nIt made a very strong impression on me; the day after I saw the opening night of Naked Lunch (long before the &quot;internet&quot;), I established and sysoped a BBS that was the primary alternative discussion forum for onliners in Edmonton, Alberta for several years.  It&apos;s name?  The Interzone.\n\nThe movie is fascinating, odd, reveals more on second viewing, and is faithful neither to Cronenburg nor Burroughs but an excellent mix of elements of both.\n\nIt has a great beat, easy to dance to... I give it an 89, Dick.\n\nEither way, you won&apos;t look at a typewriter the same way ever again."

      "reviewBody": "Intriguing and decent thriller movie with noisy action, grisly killings, suspense, pursuits, and lots of violence. Jason Statham is nice in his usual style as the cop who is dispatched to take down some thieves who are robbing a bank. There&apos;s a good production values with several stars and a clever twist ending. Five hooded robbers break into a bank and take several hostages. The carefully and neatly perfect crime about a bank robbery goes awry when the thieves abduct and take hostages to people of building interior. Psychosis and paranoia abound between the prisoners from all sides and they can see no way out and someone making desperate tryings to flee. The leader of the group demands that the police negotiate directly with Quentin Conners, an agent recently suspended from the force for a fatal accident in which hostages died. Police must save at whatever cost the hostages bank what&apos;s suddenly under siege and itself surrounded of heavily super-armed polices and SWAT. When the system breaks down... someone is about to get rich !. When the system breaks down - It&apos;s the good cops vs. The bad cops !. A stand off where nobody stands down !. It looked like the perfect bank robbery. But you can&apos;t judge a crime by its cover.\n\nFilm packs maximum tension, emotion, thriller and surprise from the subsequent attempts by the policemen to enter in the bank, along with a lot of twists and turns. This movie is a crowd-pleasing blend of intrigue, tense, action-packed, fast movement and the casting is absolutely perfect. Jason Staham (Transporter) is one of the best and most successful stars of action cinema in recent times. He is the main starring of this film by the director of &apos;In enemy hands&apos;, Tony Giglio, whose plot and treatment are inevitably reminiscent of &apos;Inside Man&apos; by the controversial filmamaker Spike Lee. Having an attractive cast alongside the main protagonist, appearing several screen figures of the stature of Wesley Snipes as the mastermind who executes an intelligent scheme and Ryan Philipe as the newcomer, naive cop, both of whom were in their best days, and both supporting the former British Olympic swimmer, Jason Statham; however, the film was released directly on DVD in the United States and many other countries, perhaps to avoid competing with the Spike Lee film: ¨The Inside Man¨stars Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster. In the rest of the world, however, the box office was acceptable and today it is better considered than in the past, deemed to be a good action film. Here Statham is top-notch as the detective suspended from his position who is forced to return to work, he plays following his ordinary manners as a tough and two-fisted guy, interpretations that have given him a considerable success, thanks to films as &quot;Revolver&quot; , &quot;Crank&quot; I and its sequel, &quot;Transporter&quot; saga, &quot;The Expendables&quot;, &quot;Killer Elite&quot;, &quot;Safe&quot; , &quot;Homefront&quot;, &quot;Wild Card&quot;, &quot;The Mechanic&quot; I and II, &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; 7 and 8, &quot;Megalodon I and II&quot;, among others . Big Star Jason Statham is well accompanied by a good support cast with many famiar faces, such as: Henry Czerny, Justine Waddell, Nicholas Lea, Jessica Steen, Rob LaBelle, John Cassini, Keegan Connor Tracy, Ty Olsson, Terry Chen, Mike Dopud and Natasha Malthe.\n\nIt displays a pulsing and thrilling musical score by composer Trevor Jones. Likewise, an appropriate and atmospheric cinematography by Richard Greatrex. This interesting film is both exciting and thrilling although with a twisted finale, being professionally directed by Tony Giglio. He&apos;s an expert on action and thriller genre as proved in : ¨In Enemy Hands¨ (U Boat), ¨Timber falls¨, ¨S. W. A. T.: Under Siege¨, ¨Doom: Annihilation¨, ¨Extraction¨, ¨Chaos¨, among others. Rating: 6/10. Decent thriller for Statham and Snipes fans.",

Those last several minutes and the first act are truly brilliant, but for some reason, the film sort of lost me in its middle and a little more than that. Not completely lost me, but it did get a little too much and it got to less interesting overall. I can&apos;t say I completely agree with the critical acclaim it&apos;s gotten, but I think it&apos;s a good, sometimes very good, film, definitely made stronger because of certain scenes. The sound mixing here is incredible, and the voice acting (in its original language) is pretty fantastic as well. Overall, still recommended but with reservations, yeah."

It is filled with a lot of heart and backed up by a great performance from Dafoe.\n\nWillem Dafoe is really great here. Delivering one of his better movies. His relationship with the dogs is done in such a really nice and heartfelt way. That&apos;s what makes it better than most dog films. It&apos;s a really enjoyable film and by the end it is really touching. That&apos;s thanks to them using a brilliant music choice of &quot;in the nature of daylight&quot; as well as the bond and development you get between the Dafoe and Togo.\n\nI don&apos;t really have any major flaws with it. I think it&apos;s a great story especially for not being familiar with the true story. The visual effects aren&apos;t always top notch but that&apos;s understandable due to being a disney original and a not a cinema film.\n\nOverall it&apos;s a really solid film, and genuinely the best dog film, we might have ever had, it might not be overly sad but it has heart and thats more than I can ask for coming from a dog film."

      "reviewBody": "I enjoyed the original &quot;Hellraiser&quot; movie and have been watching all the movies in the franchise as they have been released. Though I have to say that with each passing new movie that the franchise spawned, the quality of the storyline and ideas just grew weaker and weaker. However, the 1988 &quot;Hellbound: Hellraiser II&quot; is almost as good as the original movie.\n\nThe storyline in &quot;Hellbound: Hellraiser II&quot;, as written by Peter Atkins, picks up after the events of the 1987 &quot;Hellraiser&quot; movie, and it is a good continuation of the storyline. There is a good continuity between the 1987 movie and this 1988 sequel, and that works very well in favor of the movie.\n\nIt was nice to see cast members from the original movie, such as Ashley Laurence, Clare Higgins and Sean Chapman return to reprise their characters from the first movie. Just as it was great to see the Cenobites return to the screen as well; that being Doug Bradley, Simon Bamford, Barbie Wilde and Nicholas Vince. I am not sure if all of those playing the Cenobites were from the first movie, though.\n\nVisually then &quot;Hellbound: Hellraiser II&quot; is good. Sure, the movie is showing signs of being 34 years old already, but the effects are still adequate today and keep the movie as being watchable.\n\nI enjoyed &quot;Hellbound: Hellraiser II&quot; and have seen it about five times or so, since it was originally released.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Hellbound: Hellraiser II&quot;, from director Tony Randel, lands on a six out of ten stars.",

Not everyone can relate because at times, it is uncomfortable to watch. Putting judgment and raw emotions aside, in the end, it is about hope, tough love, determination, resourcefulness and survival.\n\nSo glad I ignored the reviews saying it was a &quot;bad&quot; movie because the movie itself is not bad. It&apos;s very well-done. I think it&apos;s just the cringe-worthy character defects that cause many reviewers pan it because maybe they were not expecting such a giant dose of reality showing up - a reality they want no part of and don&apos;t want to understand because it scares them.\n\nIt shows the ugly side of the human condition and it highlights moments when we have an opportunity to make decisions that can be life-altering. It&apos;s a story about connections, and about learning when and how to either strengthen them or release them in order to keep moving forward in life.\n\nNOTE: This should be required viewing in all addiction recovery programs.",

It&apos;s funny, heartfelt and everything you want from a movie about a shapeshifting-sadistic-sarcastic teen. Though the plot is somewhat predictable, the way it is directed and executed does leave you wanting more. The &quot;2 and a half D&quot; animation style that this movie features, might be my new fav artstyle.\n\nRare Netflix W.",

But for me, I could watch it on it&apos;s own terms and I enyojed what this movie had to give by making Chucky AI that actually does want to be Andy&apos;s friend but it is deeply broken on the inside. It&apos;s able to explore some very different things like friendship, jealousy and it takes things in a very different direction. For me it&apos;s not as good as the original, but I can still have a lot of fun with it.",

      "reviewBody": "Framed as leaked &quot;found footage&quot; from the era of space exploration in the 1970s, Apollo 18 is an attempt to out conspiracy the already rife conspiracy theories concerning the lunar landings. The trouble with framing something as being documentary style footage is you have to get the science right and be free from any loopholes that might break the audience out of the illusion. Apollo 18 falls short on this count. López-Gallego manages to recreate to a certain extent the lunar missions. Portrayed through the various cameras feeding live footage back to Earth we have a Big Brother style look into the doomed from the start space mission. The two man crew of the lunar lander also film themselves on 16mm cameras. Herein lies some of the flaws in the director&apos;s logic. We need to get into the character&apos;s perspective to relate. This is solely done through these 16mm cameras. They film themselves on the moon&apos;s surface as well as personal records in the module. The rest is all caught on remote cameras, the audience being allowed to see the threat before the crew do, privy to the danger the Department of Defence has exposed them to. The live footage makes sense to have been documented; however the 16mm film rolls do not make it out, they share the crews dire fate. How then are we seeing the actions of the crew amidst this found footage? It makes no sense pulling any reasonably astute watcher beyond the line of suspension of disbelief.\n\nIt seems clear López-Gallego wants us to care about the cast. We need to care for the conspiracy theory to resonate. The story very directly harks into the era of Watergate where the powers that be cannot be trusted. But his illusion of found footage does not stand up at all well. Does the story really fail on this account? No. It&apos;s actually fairly entertaining as it goes. The tension builds; the threat is revealed and played out. However the conspiracy theme and the documentary framing lend the film no real benefit and do not pay off. While there is reams of data on the films website to build the conspiracy it is not present enough on screen to sideline the notion we are victim to a none to subtle slight of hand. \n\nWhat the film did do with the early footage was remind me why, as a child, I was so fascinated with space. It shows with sufficient realism what the actual Apollo astronauts did and how we as a planet reached for the stars. This is not history as it tries to suggest, but it is a reminder, to me at least, of how sad it is that we no longer pursue such epic destinations as the moon or beyond."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;We are building the biggest weapon for oppression in the history of mankind.&quot; Ed Snowden \n\nWelcome to a real-time documentary that doesn&apos;t have a political agenda yet covers the most controversial and important whistle blowing in this century. Edward Snowden disclosed extensive information mining of US citizens by NSA and other agencies. Laura Poitras&apos;s thrilling but sometimes slow documentary takes us to Hong Kong to witness Snowden&apos;s alarming the world about the US spying on its citizens and world leaders among others.\n\nCitizenfour (the handle Snowden used when communicating) keeps the audience front row and center as Snowden makes contact with director Laura Poitras to arrange footage of his process, and most importantly with reporter Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian to write about this game-changing event. Neither is hesitant to take on the story, possibly because of its incendiary nature and the honesty of the whistleblower.\n\nThis story is like a great Jason Bourne spy story (without the glamour and tensions) pitting former intelligence operative Snowden against the great American political and media machines. In the outside world, German chancellor Angela Merkel expressed shock that the US was monitoring her cell phone conversations.\n\nPoitras smartly includes President Obama condemning Snowden as unpatriotic and a danger to the American people, an argument going on even as you read this review. Curiously, the documentary makes no argument and goes easy on the suspense, making significant historical cinema but not gripping drama.\n\nThe so far unanswerable question is whether he&apos;s a hero or a traitor. The Snowden exposed to the ever present harsh light of camera and mics seems completely at peace with himself as he considers the rough life he has elected as a whistleblower. Indeed we are fortunate to see him at the most stressful point in his life being cool and level-headed. While Poitras makes sure we get to know him intimately, she never loses sight of the fact that this doc is about government spying.\n\nCitizenfour is a fascinating, risky, and brave film for everyone who is interested in the challenges of truth telling."

After this change, the story gets more interesting and engaging. Even though the day repeats itself, the film does not feel repetitive thanks to the little behavioural changes she makes. The Ending is touching and ending. I think the story inspires people to be nice to each other, and extend a helping hand whenever possible. We don&apos;t get the luxury to start things over when we​mess up, and we don&apos;t get too many chances to learn from our mistakes, unless we&apos;re the woman in this film."

      "reviewBody": "Emily arrives in Miami with aspirations of becoming a professional dancer and soon falls in love with Sean, a young man who leads a dance crew in elaborate, cutting-edge flash mobs, called &quot;The Mob.&quot; When a wealthy business man threatens to develop The Mob&apos;s historic neighborhood and displace thousands of people, Emily must band together with Sean and The Mob to turn their performance art into protest art, and risk losing their dreams to fight for a greater cause. -- (C) Summit\n\nAs I was waiting in line to see this film, a boy (about 7) was with his mother. He explained to her about all the dancers that were in the previous STEP UP films and seemed to have an extensive and in-depth knowledge about these dancers that I could never compete with. I suppose that these films are geared toward people like the boy I overheard, those who surround themselves in an art form with many styles. I don&apos;t watch shows like SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE, but there is something endearing about the STEP UP films (excluding the first) that separate themselves from other dance flicks. First and foremost, they don&apos;t take themselves seriously. Their predictable story lines are an excuse to showcase some mad dance moves that you&apos;ll never get to see in life. These films know that they aren&apos;t high art, so comparing them to something like THE GODFATHER is entirely missing the point.\n\nHowever, like everything else, the STEP UP franchise will eventually lose its luster. This is the case with REVOLUTION, as with most franchises that suffer from sequelitis. REVOLUTION is entertaining for what it&apos;s worth, but it isn&apos;t as exciting to watch as the previous two entries. The film lacks the charm of its two predecessors, mostly due to the lack of the lovable Moose, who only appears in a short cameo. Regardless, the dancing sequences are top notch and filled with wonder and creativity. There&apos;s also an added twist concerning protest art which was interesting. One sequence, in particular, is sure to wow the audience, taking place in an art museum where the art literally comes to life. There&apos;s also the obligatory 10+ minute dance in the climax that is just as good. However, I must note that another &quot;dance&quot; sequence will likely disturb people, particularly because of the recent movie theater shooting in Colorado. It involves smoke grenades, people being covered in gas masks and armor, and gun shot sound effects. In and of itself, the scene is supposed to be alarming, but the added tragedy just makes it ill-timed.\n\nLike STEP UP 3, the film takes full advantage of its 3D technology, from the opening scene to the end credits. There&apos;s a lot of gimmicky &quot;pop out&quot; moments but scenes with amazing depth as well. These films prove to be some of very few films that know how to use 3D well and makes one wonder if other filmmakers should have to learn from these guys. The story is also interesting as the film tackles on the current issue of the Occupy movement (done with flashmobs). Lastly, the actors can surely dance, but their performances are merely sufficient.\n\nIf you like the STEP UP films, there&apos;s no reason you won&apos;t enjoy this one. The dance sequences and 3D are great, but it&apos;s forgettable once the credits roll. Additionally, I hope the filmmakers stop the franchise at this one because it&apos;s starting to get stale and repetitive. On another note, I would like to indicate that director Scott Speer directed some episodes from the web series THE LEGION OF EXTRAORDINARY DANCERS (LXD), created by Jon Chu, which I highly recommend to watch as it provides a great alternative to your usual dance flicks (think THE AVENGERS but with dancing). It&apos;s not as bad as it sounds. Trust me.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;I fear you speak upon the rack, where men enforced do speak anything.&quot; This Shakespearean line from The Merchant of Venice is echoed again in the new film Rendition which introduces the viewer to the &quot;enhanced methods of interrogation&quot;, renditions, which began in the Clinton Administration and have become more commonplace since the terror attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nThe film features an all-star cast, with Oscar winners Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin, and Reese Witherspoon, as well as Peter Sarsgaard, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Omar Metwally. Supporting roles filled by unfamiliar actors deliver as well, sucking the audience into the plot, and showing how many people can be affected by overseas terror attacks, and our means of investigating them.\n\nRendition follows an Egyptian born terrorism suspect (Metwally) who is taken by U.S. officials following his flight from South Africa to Washington DC to an undisclosed prison overseas. His pregnant wife (Witherspoon) ventures to Washington DC to find out about his disappearance through a family friend and Senator&apos;s employee (Sarsgaard). Gyllenhaal plays a young CIA analyst at the overseas detention facility who monitors the violent interrogation.\n\nThis film follows the emotional plights of the torture victim (Metwally), and those involved in obtaining the supposed information from him. Some, like the CIA analyst (Gyllenhaal), are visibly shaken and horrified by the methods exercised, while others, the stern Senator (Streep) and foreign interrogator (Yigal Naor), see it as necessary and effective.\n\nThe film may be described by some as a political piece, but is ultimately an emotional one. Metwally&apos;s performance as the tortured prisoner is Oscar-worthy. The film does not intend to preach, but rather to question and inform the audience on a topic that does not often have a human face put on it. Renditions have been known to work, but have also been known to produce false information from innocent prisoners. The film simply depicts the emotional struggles of those involved in such grave business, and does so in a way that will affect every viewer differently. The film will keep your interest, and have you engaged in each of the character&apos;s plights.",

Forget Ivan Reitman&apos;s great direction and the highly suitable music of James Newton Howard. Even the notable guest appearances from senators, journalists etc.\n\nThat makes it for me one of my all time favorite movies, is the heart of its characters, especially Dave.\n\nIt&apos;s all about doing the right thing.\n\nUnfortunately almost never good people reach the highest offices. You need to be a politician. To sell yourself bit by bit, to compromise, to lie or even worst.\n\nBut what if? What if purely by chance or because the universe wanted it, a good, honest, caring man becomes the most powerful man in the world? This is the main theme of this great movie and you surely wont give it justice if you see it as a farce or a comedy.\n\nFor me this movie is a 10. I really think writers and directors should make more movies like this, instead of writing about lunatics and serial killers."

There was an early screening at our local theater, so we went, and dear lord, this was good. I am not well versed in Transformers lore, nor have I seen most of the films, so I&apos;m not able to speak from a fan&apos;s perspective. With that being said, I now feel SUPER motivated to go watch and learn as much as possible about these characters. The main focus of the film on the relationship between Orion Pax and D-16 was an absolute emotional rollercoaster - and the action scenes absolutely had us on the edge of our seats. Every. Single. One. From the initial mining accident, to the race, to the train (and so on, don&apos;t want to ruin too much from the final act), each big action event seemed to one-up the last. I had an absolute blast and was not intending to go see this film twice, but I will absolutely be going back once it hits theaters for real.",

I am sure you can see the problem here.\n\nBasically it is a film about a man that rediscovers his soul... then dies from it. Not a fresh thing in Asian movies, but something that the (re)makers of this film bet the Americans will find cool. I, myself, understood the idea, but saw no reason in remaking the Thai movie that had the same idea and add almost nothing to it other than production costs.\n\nBottom line: sad-good-assassin story, with no twist.

I had no expectations about Watcher, but it turned out to be really good.\n\nLike seriously, everything worked so well up until the ending, which felt somewhat disappointing and didn&apos;t make much sense. It wasn&apos;t the worst thing they could&apos;ve done though, so thanks for that.\n\nActual care was put into the film and it shows. All the elements they have are nothing new, really, but these blend quite well. The unfamiliar environment, the language barrier, the fear, and the feeling of being misunderstood and left alone by the careless close ones. Great acting, great atmosphere, great music. Just overall a solid thriller that tried to step away from cliches as much as possible.\n\nI can agree that the pacing was relatively slow, but it only helped absorb the atmosphere of what was happening.\n\nA split 7.5/10 could&apos;ve been an 8.5/10 if not for the ending that felt a little too much, although I get the message.\n\nI am looking forward to new movies from the director.",

      "reviewBody": "Now after watching The Advent Children twice, the storyline isn&apos;t as shallow as majority has criticized it to be in my opinion. If you haven&apos;t played FFVII or disliked it for whatever reason, this movie is most likely not for you. Being familiar to the original story is a prerequisite to understanding AC fully, otherwise you will just see the greatest CG animation in your life so far.\n\nWithout actually spoiling the storyline, I must admit that after seeing AC we have been putting pieces together with my friends relying on our knowledge of FFVII. Seeing it second time allowed to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the questions we may have had were answered. Some were not. AC is clearly for FFVII players/fans and doesn&apos;t honestly try to be anything else. There is little to none realism in it outside FFVII world which serves the purpose. Music is mostly reconstructed FFVII themes with a heavier touch (TBM team according to end credits) and works well with the eye candy without exceptions. I found the music enhancing the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situations.\n\nWe all know you can&apos;t put a FFVII in 1.5 hours and keeping that in mind the storyline actually offered more to me than I expected. There are two issues at hand in FFVII : AC and both stories were wrapped up very smoothly between the action sequences. And trust me when I say there&apos;s a lot of it. Action that is.\n\nI&apos;m changing my vote from 9 to 10 after watching it the second time because I had missed a few explanatory sequences I couldn&apos;t put together the first time that provided some answers. As a warning, it&apos;s going to be easy to disregard the story and concentrate on graphics, but try not to judge the Adevent Children because of that. If you don&apos;t let the story in, it&apos;s no wonder it seems sloppy.\n\nI&apos;m not going to praise the graphics because I assume we all know they are awesome, which might be an understatement. Especially characters talk so much more with their facial expressions than ever before. I hope you pay attention to the storyline for it actually makes sense and works well with the whole. Get ready for the ride of your life, there are no breaks.",

Blood Red Sky is not of the same quality as Quentin Tarantino&apos;s movie but it&apos;s certainly worth watching. Nice make-up, decent acting, and a good surprising story. I agree that the first half was better than the ending but overal I can&apos;t be disappointed by this movie which I enjoyed from beginning till the end and I&apos;m certain a lot of people that like the horror genre will do as well.",

If you like movies where young children outwit stupid grown-ups then this is the movie for you.\n\nJoe Mantegna performs wonderfully as the leader of a trio of kidnappers who kidnap Baby Bink but soon find him causing more trouble than they can handle. If you liked films such as Home Alone then this movie will suit you.\n\nThere are wonderful scenes throughout. Baby Bink escapes his captors and starts crawling round the city and oddly, not one single adult seems to think this is out of the ordinary. The fun is seeing the blundering trio try to recapture him. There are some great moments, particularly when Baby Bink ends up in the gorilla cage at the zoo and when the trio arouse the suspicions of a policeman and Joe Mantegna hides Bink under a coat on his lap. \n\nWhilst children will really enjoy this movie, adults will also get a kick out of it. Worth viewing if you can."

And I would probably cry if the ending was any different.\n\nI won&apos;t go into possibilities and impossibilities of metaphysical, because that&apos;s absolutely not what this story is about; purgatory, if you will, is only the stage, where the romantic play is performed, with that, it&apos;s innovative though actually daring, as it was probably obvious the box office would never explode from what &apos;Wristcutters&apos; would make. In my opinion, the movie is so well made it would have been great even if it was stripped of suicide thing and it was just a plain love story. Oh and Shannyn Sossamon was so convincing, I think I&apos;m in love with her now. ;)",

      "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t mind the bad review up there, whether you&apos;ve seen or not the German original version, The Experiment still remains an excellent movie with two great actors (and a great plot): Forrest Whitaker and Adrien Brody. Interesting movie that shows that even if we all pretend to have some kind of moral, we all still remain animals that will bite to defend our pack. Sometimes you watch a 96mn movie and it feels like you were watching The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston (don&apos;t mean this is a bad film, it&apos;s just very long), but this one is the total opposite! you&apos;ll be annoyed when the credits will appear at the end. Also, if like me you&apos;re a bit sick and tired of the current Hollywood buzz which consists to make many spy movies with a huge budget, you will enjoy that film, because it&apos;s quite simple, only few rooms needed at location. So the question is: are you a prisoner?",

After G20, I thought this would be another movie about a highly skilled POTUS saving the world, especially with John Cena in the role, but it&apos;s really not. Unlike in his other movies, John Cena is not the tough guy here. Idris Elba is supposed to be given his military background, but the writers are smart enough not to overdo it. Instead the role of badasses are left to those who are supposed to be, the agents and the mercenaries. I like the casting a lot. Even though the story is somewhat generic, the cast members carried it well. It&apos;s a very enjoyable, fun movie, and that&apos;s what entertainment should be.",

      "reviewBody": "A magical film about the power and importance of story telling and imagination. The creation of the ever fecund mind of Terry Gilliam, this may very well be my favorite movie (ah, but it is so very hard to choose). Filled with a spirit of adventure, and a deftness far too rare these days, it is the delightful tale of the adventurous life of Baron Munchausen. He is a hero of the grand old sort, a kind of 17th century James Bond.\n\nBaron Munchausen has a knowledge of fine wines, is popular with the ladies, and is the finest soldier in the kingdom. He has a band of sidekicks (the fastest man, the strongest, one with amazing sight, another with amazing lungs and hearing) who assist him in fighting the Turks; traveling to meet the King of the Moon; falling into the center of the earth to meet Vulcan and Aphrodite; and playing cards with the Grim reaper, after being swallowed by an enormous monster-fish the size of an island.\n\nAlong the way Gilliam&apos;s wit skewers rationalism, science, realism, practicality and pragmatics. As much an explication of faith as a depiction of what makes life truly worth living, and what is worth dying for, I rent this again and again. It is only my own foolishness that has prevented me from purchasing a copy. Literally wonderful.\n\nWatch for fabulous cameos from a whole host of unexpected people, including Robin Williams and Sting.",

Characters are believable and much more nuanced than you typically get in this type of dramas.\n\nWe all heard a stories like this, but they are rarely explored respectfully and without going over the top.

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll sum this film up in 5 words, &apos;on par with fight club&apos;.\n\nThis is a great film, every second of this film is worth 9/10. I&apos;ll start with the films flaws. Firstly, the main character is very weak, I&apos;m not sure whether it&apos;s poor writing or bad acting but he just comes across as an idiot rather than the deep, flawed, entrepreneur that the film wanted to portray. Secondly, even in the year 2,000 floppy disks were an ageing technology, without giving much away there&apos;s a scene where an entire companies data is copied to a floppy disk. The film includes a lot of central characters and doesn&apos;t provide any back-story for any of them, this wouldn&apos;t be so much of a problem if the central character wasn&apos;t so weak but by the end of it you feel as though you haven&apos;t seen a single character develop or even begin to understood any of the characters but you have just seen a good film.\n\nPraise: This film is amazing. The film really captures the desires of society and gives them a face. The characters really convey the shallow two facedness you come across every day where they&apos;re happy and pleasant until something happens that could even remotely damage their cash flow. Every person you&apos;ve ever met that wanted to make a quick buck is in this film, the consumerism and lack of social conscience that constantly plagues society is so prevalent in this film. It also approaches the topic of share trading from a much more accessible angle, they don&apos;t put much effort into adding the right industry terms or showing scenes of the NY stock exchange - they show the consequences of share trading, the lack of understanding of the average consumer and give you a better understanding of where the money comes from. If you&apos;re anything like me then this film takes you on a ride where you are the main character every step of the way until finally you return to life with a much deeper understanding of the desires people succumb to in modern society. This film includes very young appearances by a lot of famous actors, Ben Affleck, Vin Diesel etc. who all pull their weight to give life to the film. I&apos;m explaining the film in a very stale way but I can&apos;t help it, it&apos;s on par with &apos;fight club&apos; - you can&apos;t explain why the film is good in a way that does it justice, just watch 2 hours of cinema that will improve your quality of life.",

Strange really given who Colonia Dignidad affected, and who were tortured, abused, held virtual hostage etc. I was in Chile at the end of the reign of the oppressive regime of Pinochet - and felt the film lacked the sound of the Chilean dialect (of Spanish). Maybe it could have included more of the direct and authentic voice of those who suffered. Or those who lived in the region. There were so many myths about the place in the media, in the streets, within the popular culture. Pity because this was a story that was worth telling.",

It&apos;s character-driven, centered on the relationship between Val (PAcino) and Doc (Walken), both of whom are spectacular.\n\nThere&apos;s some great dialogue between the two, and despite what you may read on here, the story is quite solid, if simplistic. I don&apos;t think people have fully grasped these characters in some reviews, or the meaning of the title &quot;Stand Up Guys&quot;. They&apos;re throwbacks, and the situations they encounter represent the direction the world has headed over the years, a world that Doc is forced to be a part of, despite wanting a quieter life.\n\nI won&apos;t go on any further, but I found the characters endearing, and the relationship between Val and Doc kept me on the hook.\n\nNice soundtrack, too.\n\nCheers",

If they could just get their music played on radio then they could be something. They came up with a hairbrained scheme to hold a radio station hostage with fake guns in order to get their song played. Things got out of hand once cops swarmed the place.\n\n&quot;Airheads&quot; was enjoyable, even all these years later, though the Sandler-style humor doesn&apos;t have the same appeal to me as it once did.",

Even though you have quite a lot of good actors in it (and Keanu Reaves), the movie really can not live up to any of the expectations the viewer might have.\n\nThe eco message, the social message all are like dust in the wind. The action somewhat works ... though having the Dude Keanu running circles around alleged (military?) trained men ... and all meant to be taken seriously ... that&apos;s really a tough ask.\n\nDon&apos;t get it twisted: I like Keanu. I have not met him, but he seems like a very cool person/Dude or whatever you want to call him. Having said all that, his acting abilities or his most screen performances are not really more than a guy who flails his arms and seems lost with puppy eyes. This may sound a lot meaner than I it is meant. I just want to make the point that if you don&apos;t let your personal feelings in the way, you may see through him and not see him as a scientist ... not matter how hard you try to suspend your disbelief.\n\nTake all this into account (and the quite predictable plot) and you know why the rating is so low ... even though the ending might be able to get you to slide onto the edge of your seat for a second ...",

      "reviewBody": "From the moment I pressed play on the DVD remote, the whole family was transfixed by this wonderful movie. It was so good, that we immediately watched it again. So what was so good about it? Well, firstly Bruno has to be the best dog (either animated or live) in any movie. The subtle observation of its daily routines are among my favourite scenes. Second, the humour is refreshingly dark and constantly surprising (it&apos;s not too far removed from Gary Larson&apos;s The Far Side). The scene showing the expansion of Paris to convey the passing of time had us in hysterics. Thirdly, it&apos;s just so imaginative. Everything is exaggerated beyond belief. If you like your animation to have a touch of realism, then stay away. In Belleville, things are grotesquely exaggerated. I&apos;ve noticed a few negative comments about this film, which raises the question of who is going to like it and who isn&apos;t. I guess the fairest comment I can make is to say that this probably isn&apos;t mainstream stuff. If your favourite movies are summer blockbusters, then maybe this isn&apos;t for you. If, on the other hand, you like discovering quiet gems from time to time, stumbling across something a little different on a cable channel, then this could be just what you&apos;re looking for."

The supporting characters are no slouches either. John C. Reilly is marvelous as Sidney&apos;s sweet, if somewhat slow witted protege. Samuel Jackson could have easily coasted on this one, simply repeating a performance from any of a number of previous tough guy types. Instead he creates an entirely new character, one with a reptilian quality not seen in his usual thugs. Even Gwenyth Paltrow is unusually strong as Clem, the waitress who wants it understood that, even if she sometimes sleeps with men for money, she is definitely NOT a prostitute.\n\nI&apos;ve been a fan of PT Anderson for a while now, and this film gave me new insight into why it is I like him so much. Anderson is that great rarity in modern filmmaking, an actor&apos;s director. He gathers terrific actors and inspires them to career-topping performances. There&apos;s no fiendishly complex plot here, no nailbiting suspense, no big payoff at the end. Just marvelous actors making the most of an excellent script.",

This film can be considered a serious blight on the resumes of Charlize Theron and Johnny Depp. I found the film a terrible mess,mostly because a slightly interesting premise, (which had tricked me into watching) disintegrated into adisjointed, incoherent plot and the final blow, horrific special effects. The cast seems to struggle with the script and the scenes of violence and sex are awful and unnecessary. Even the combined talents of Theron and Depp cannot save this bombshell from outer space."

      "name": "Bad enough it may keep you from reading the novel. Reviewers that have not read the novel are making wrong assumptions.",
      "reviewBody": "If you have not read the book, use this review as a reason to either bypass the film initially and read the book first, or to understand that the screenplay is a huge departure from the intended story.\n\nThe novel Winter&apos;s Tale is a romance with a supernatural overtone bathed in a tribute to New York City if it could always remain in a mystical state. The book is sometimes verbose, often funny, and heartfelt in it&apos;s depiction of love. The movie insults your intellect by ignoring the vast symbolism used in the book. Example: Time Travel - The book allows for you to understand certain characters have time traveled, while the movie insists certain characters travel only to follow others telling you that they are supernatural beings. It&apos;s NOT so. Here is exactly where the director really fowled the film. Deviating from the author&apos;s intent, turning the story into a devil&apos;s agents interplay is awkward out of place. The devil was NEVER once mentioned or implied in the original story. Yes, some devices are necessary in film to help the audience, but Pearly Soames purpose as a protagonist in the film is reduced to silly. Furthermore Pearly&apos;s reason for chasing Peter had nothing to do with Peter&apos;s love for Beverly. Pearly never met Beverly in the novel. Here is one more non-spoiler as it too won&apos;t be found in the film. In the book, Pearly&apos;s purpose for chasing Peter Lake began the moment he forced Peter Lake into his employ and Peter later turned a huge heist against Pearly. Pearly&apos;s gang was decimated for a time. From that day forward, Pearly&apos;s will to kill Peter grew in every chase that left him empty handed.\n\nBeing sold as a straight up romance or love story is almost a mistake because the film does try to encompass the much larger story surrounding the love affair. From Peter Lake&apos;s horse which has a story of his own to a wildly funny malapropian newspaper editor named Craig Binky. Other Characters such as Virginia Gamely were altered ridiculously. Virginia was from the Lake of the Coherees in the novel. In the film, she is just another New Yorker. This is where the film falls apart. The director&apos;s vain effort to include the other threaded stories inside the book are convoluted.\n\nWhen you use the same title as a book for a movie it&apos;s wise to make an honest adaptation, otherwise change the name of the movie from the book entirely to avoid comparisons entirely. Then follow the guide of placing in the credits, &quot;based on the story Winter&apos;s Tale by Mark Helprin.&quot; Director Akiva Goldsman (also wrote the screenplay) zig-zagged across both these traditional paths and the story suffered in his mash-up. Change a characters hair color, but don&apos;t change their role or destiny. \n\nIn this case Winter&apos;s Tale isn&apos;t even a director&apos;s interpretation. The book weaves a subtle supernatural element that may be so vague that the director wanted to spell it out to moviegoers. In doing so, he dumbs down the original story to the point it insults the audience, holding their hand and telling them what to think as opposed to letting the moviegoer figure things out.\n\nWinter&apos;s Tale is condensed, filtered and sanitized of it&apos;s soul. Even without having read the novel, evidence of awkward changes for the screenplay dumb down the original subtle supernatural theme which was ironically as clear in it&apos;s message as it was abstract in it&apos;s delivery.\n\nAs a romance film there are heartfelt moments and the chemistry between Peter Lake and Beverly Penn does have enough strength to bring a tear to some audience members. Collin Farrell&apos;s soft humanity is felt quite often too. Yet, except for a candid conversation among the two men Peter Lake and Isaac Penn which draws an intellectual laugh, there is no humor to break up the tension in the film. Yes, the contrast of the book is once again worth noting. The book had meaningful characters which were lost in the movie. They were not a direct part of the love story, and as such were eliminated. Eliminating so many great elements of the original story killed the journey Peter Lake would take you through. The cinematography alone in Winter&apos;s Tale was not enough to paint the fantastic picture of the magical New York City the author intended as a character in the story. Without that fabric the mystical world Peter Lake and Beverly Penn exist is absent. \n\nWinter&apos;s Tale is a complex supernatural love story with too many important characters to have fit into a short two or three hour film. It&apos;s not written in a manner that would translate into a part one and part two series either. Perhaps it&apos;s best medium will one day be a mini- series a network can allow to play out over five to eight episodes. It&apos;s often said that the journey is the reward and the story of Winter&apos;s Tale is a long journey that cannot be condensed. In this case, spotlighting one part of the journey is not fulfilling either. \n\nLet&apos;s just make one thing clear to anyone that has neither read the book nor seen the movie. The love story in this film takes place in the first quarter of the novel. There are three remaining quarters to the story that thread the love story of Peter Lake and Beverly Penn into the overall journey, but their story is told early and ends early. Well, that&apos;s not entirely true. And yet it is. Now for all those clues and a tease, don&apos;t you just wonder what a book that has three quarters more to say – has to say? For my full review just search my name, Lars Hindsley and you&apos;ll find DangerMans Lair."

      "reviewBody": "In New York a disease carried by cockroaches threatens to wipe out a whole generation of children.  A scientist, Susan Tyler, breeds a new bug that mimics the cockroach and wipes out the disease.  However years later something is living in New York&apos;s subways that looks human.   Tyler suspects that her breed has not died out but has evolved to imitate it&apos;s natural predator - us.  Her investigations into the subway lead her to more than she bargained for.\n\nThis is an atmospheric thriller from Guillermo del Toro, director of The Devil&apos;s Backbone and Cronos.  He manages to mix great director with good old fashioned monster horror to great effect.  The concept itself is clever, even if the idea of bugs evolving to look very like humans is a little far fetched.  However, once the action moves to the subway the fact that the bugs are clearly lethal no matter what they look like, makes this less important.  The film is quite short and makes the action come quicker and seem more urgent.  Several people get killed by the bug that wouldn&apos;t usually get killed in this sort of horror (children for example), this is very effective as it is quite scary to see the unexpected happen.\n\nThe mood is dark throughout and Del Toro uses the sewers and subway to great effect, creating a real sense of claustrophobia - like the humans have entered the bug&apos;s world and not the other way round.  The bugs are shown early on in the film - usually not a good idea (keep it hidden in the Jaws way), but here the special effects are good enough to make the bug really believable.  However the horror is not in seeing the bugs but in they way they hunt and kill - the fear is in what could happen.  That&apos;s why seeing them doesn&apos;t take anything away.\n\nThe cast are great, Sorvino especially is very good in the lead.  Jeremy Northam and Charles S. Dutton are good in support and Abraham Murray adds a bit of cameo class (though his role is quite unnecessary).  But the director is the real star adding some genuine scares and real mood to a film that could have easily been just another creature-feature that goes straight to video and straight to the back of your mind.\n\nOverall a superior creature horror film."

      "reviewBody": "Quills is the modernized story of the Marquis de Sade, whose steamy writings whipped France into a sexual fury in the late 18th Century. And by modernized I mean that it has been told through the experiences of a lot of French people who speak English and with British accents. But no matter, I&apos;m willing to accept that everyone in France in 1800 spoke perfect British even if only because of Geoffrey Rush&apos;s brilliant performance. With every movie that he comes out with I become more and more convinced that there is nothing he can&apos;t do.\n\nIn order to know virtue, as the Marquis explains, one must first understand vice. In Philip Kaufman&apos;s Quills, the focus is on the Marquis de Sade after his writing has taken him beyond the artistic freedom generally accepted in the 18th and 19th centuries, even to elite aristocracy like himself. It is a detailed exploration of the events that led from him being a social elitist to living almost three decades in prison, writing things that caused his keepers to make it so difficult for him to write that he ultimately uses his own blood and excrement for ink, and his clothing, the walls of his cell, and his own skin as parchment.\n\nLuckily for the Marquis, at first anyway, is that there is something of an understanding priest in the Abbe du Coulmier, another wonderful performance from Joaquin Phoenix. An intensely religious man, Coulmier believes that the Marquis should be allowed to write, if only to purge himself of the sadism with which his head is filled and which would later be named after him.\n\nKate Winslet plays Madeleine, a laundry maid who smuggles the Marquis&apos; writing out of the asylum so that it can be published, for which many people are not happy, but many others are. The Marquis dips into the extensive world of the forbidden sexual taboos of the 18th and 19th centuries, writing extensively about them without a care in the world for propriety. One may wonder to what extent the Marquis&apos; writings were such a hit because they were forbidden, or because of their lewd content, which may euphemistically be described as guilty pleasures for the masses. Indeed, Larry Flynt was not working, so graphic pornography was something of a rarity.\n\nThere is a curious relationship between the Marquis and a physician named Royer-Collard, played by Michael Caine, who is assigned to law down the law with the Marquis and prevent him from writing anymore. The glee with which the Marquis mocks and taunts him are some of the best parts of this outstanding film. There is a great parallel between the two characters, as well. Royer-Collard pretends to be a moral role model, at the same time taking a wife who is young enough to be his daughter, possibly even his granddaughter, and treats the Marquis with exactly the same sadistic (if I can again use the term for the behavior for which the Marquis would later be named) behavior that he condemns that Marquis for writing about. Both men engage in many of the same practices, it&apos;s just that the Marquis makes no attempt and has no interest in hiding his interests in the pleasures of the flesh.\n\nI think that the most important thing to remember about this movie is that it is able to deal with a person who&apos;s beliefs are, I like to think, below the moral compasses of most of the people who will watch the movie, but it&apos;s not about what he was writing, it&apos;s about the fact that he was writing at all. It&apos;s about his defiance in the face of a corrupt moral authority, his insistence on maintaining an artistic expression that was not well received but that was certainly therapeutic to him. Sure, his sanity is in question, to say the least, but as they say, genius is often associated with madness.\n\nWhat a great coincidence, too, because so is Geoffrey Rush.",

This is one of the few films which has inspired me to read the source material; the autobiography by the journalist Kim Baker..\n\nThe film starts with comic moments as greenhorn middle-America Kim Baker (Tina Fey) arrives in a war zone. Then, the film darkens as it touches on the corruption of the expatriate community and the seduction of war reporting.\n\nSurprisingly, Tina Fey can act in a dramatic role. Being comic with a straight face, facing danger, fending off romeos, and falling in love. In the end, Kim Baker rediscovers herself and returns home.\n\nThe film deals superficially with the horror faced by Afghan civilians and the root causes of the insurgency. However, this is the story of a white woman in a foreign land.\n\nOverall, the film was predictable but lightly touches the soul. Credit to the editor for walking the difficult line between entertainment and horror. The rest of the cast did a creditable job."

While there&apos;s still a fair amount of narration, much of the story is told through its gorgeous visuals. \n\nThoughtful and touching, this movie proves I was right to keep watching Shinkai&apos;s films in spite of continual frustration and disappointment. I did it because I knew what he was trying for could work beautifully if he just learned to allow silence, and now he has. I hope this is a sign that he has matured into the animator I always hoped he&apos;d be.",

It&apos;s a cute, mildly funny, sometimes sappy, story about a woman, Kat, played by Debra Messing, so wrecked from her last relationship that when she has to go to her sister&apos;s wedding where she knows that he ex will be she hires a male escort to go and make him jealous and her family get off her case. The escort, Nick, played by Dermot Mulroney, isn&apos;t your average Gigolo. No, he&apos;s what you would consider the cream of the crop, and he doesn&apos;t come cheap. A cute, non-threatening premise, for a genuinely cute, non-threatening, romantic comedy.\n\nYou can&apos;t go in expecting genius, because that&apos;s not what you&apos;ll get. The Wedding Date, however, is a glorious, indulgent movie that will leave you smiling. It&apos;s a movie for women, by a woman director, and it&apos;s really for any girl who ever wished she could have a happy ending like Cinderella. It&apos;s not all roses, of course, which keeps it interesting. It&apos;s all par for the course, however, when it comes to romantic comedies. Plus, the few glimpses of a bare-bottomed, Mulroney will keep you interested, too.\n\nI ranked this movie an 8 out of 10. I wasn&apos;t comparing it to Gone with the Wind, or the Godfather. I was comparing it to other cute romantic comedies, and as far as they go, this was a good one.",

This is a film that sets a great example of what movie making should be today. First because it was done without special effects or computers, second because it was very nicely done in terms of lighting, camera, acting and directing and third because it made me feel exactly what the characters were feeling the whole time. I was on my car and still I was left without words. As I drove, I was complaining about how somebody&apos;s negligence can have such consequences in other people&apos;s lives and reflecting on how arrogant and cocky we get even when we are completely out of our domain, thinking we know better. I am very fund of sharks and I love to see them on film, on TV and as close as an aquarium that has them can let you see them. I just finished reading a book about the USS Indianapolis and believe me there are terrifying stories for you to imagine about survivor&apos;s experiences with the sharks, but for the very first time someone made me feel like I was really among them myself and also someone made me feel very scared of them. I was changing positions over and over on my seat during the movie because I was really feeling uneasy and frightened at times. So come and see Open Water and let this movie remind you how fragile life is and how human we are. Live the experience of helplessness, terror and impotence towards what you cant see or solve as if you were really there and your life depended on it. Congratulations to the whole crew."

This movie teaches me to never move next door to a cop no matter how friendly they appear to be. But Lakeview Terrace is a bit extreme with the cop next door type of deal. Not only that the Mattsons had to deal with a cop living next door but he&apos;s a racist. Able abused his power as a police office by spying on the Mattsons and acting upon it. I know somehow that&apos;s illegal to snoop into people&apos;s privacy. This is one of the best parts Samuel Jackson played in a movie next to Pulp Fiction and Shaft 2000. Kerry Washington was excellent as the Ms. Lisa Matton,Kerry is versatile. Overall Lakeview Terrace is a interesting movie that build ups to a powerful climaxing ending. Recommend anyone to watch it with a family or friend."

The novel involves much deeper issues, like a father taking money from his retarded daughter, a man who beat his wife and forced her to allow their daughter to die following an accident, a man who refuses to support his children, et cetera.\n\nThis movie focuses on petty revenge because they are not happy with being discarded for twenty year olds.  It has NONE of the book&apos;s depth, characters, or deep emotional satisfaction in revenge.  It has nothing more than cheap satisfaction and cheap revenge.  I watched it once and would never look at it again."

      "reviewBody": "I was having a bad day when I was watching this movie, and I am glad that I saw this movie. \n\nOK, the story is outdated.I mean at this era of live-in relationships and people hating the idea of marriage, this movie is about a married middle class couple. And many people do criticize the part where Shahrukh acts like two different personalities and his own wife doesn&apos;t recognize him while only his spectacles and mustache are missing and anyone can easily figure out that both are one and the same. ( When I first read the plot overview of the movie, I seriously laughed) \n\nWell the most obvious explanation would be that Indian audience ( not all,but most of them) would not like idea of an Indian wife having an extra-marital affair especially when the movie is set in a place which is trademark of Indian culture. I do accept that Yash Raj have produced many movies like Salaam Namaste ( portraying live-in relationship) but that story wasn&apos;t set in India. It is OK to not respect your culture if you are not in India. :p \n\nSo Adi made his wife love the same person with a different personality which people will easily accept (though now we people are having difficulty in accepting it) Next negative of the movie would be its length and slow pace of the movie. But i really was glad that the movie lasted for long. :) \n\nThe movie is too predictable but actually that adds as the positive point for the movie, as somewhere in your mind you want that to happen and when it happens, you are glad that it happened. The movie has many outdated and clichéd dialogues which remind you of the Bollywood movies of the 80s, but Shahrukh&apos;s dialogue delivery just makes it seem alright ! :)\n\nWell now the acting department. Shahrukh Khan did it again. well, I personally had this feeling that SRK normally overacts in movies directed by the chopras and johars. But this is an exception. He really did it well especially in the role of Surinder Sahni. He made everyone smile, laugh and cry. He really makes you feel for his character.\n\nAnushka Sharma did an appreciable job doing all the justice to her role. And do watch out for Vinay Pathak!! His presence does really rock the screen.\n\nThe dialogues are smart and funny though it gets every clichéd at many parts. The music is average but the background score does deserve an appreciation.\n\nI really guarantee you that it is a kind of movie where you will be smiling while tears roll down your cheeks! \n\nI was really happy to see all the people in the cinema sit though the end-credits ( which is really a special part of the movie)\n\nIts outdated typical bollywood movie, and I really hated the plot of the movie initially but now that i have watched it, I cant help but say, that is one of the sweet romantic movies Bollywood has ever delivered to us.\n\nIts of course not an extraordinary movie, but the director has really turned a very ordinary story into a very sweet romantic movie full of heart, which is definitely worth a second watch ! :)",

For the first 30 minutes of the movie, there is nothing remotely funny, original or entertaining. I gave it the benefit of the doubt, telling myself &quot;ok, Ron Howard is just setting up the premise. It will get better.&quot; But it doesn&apos;t. Not a bit.\n\nI had to repeatedly resist the urge to take out my phone and play Skee Ball. I should have, however, given in to the temptation to leave the theatre and demand my money back.\n\nPS to the studio - don&apos;t market a film as a comedy if its not remotely funny. It does nothing to enhance your already tarnished reputation. (Clearly you are still pumping out left over crap from 2010)",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Shine&quot; is one of the great movies of the &apos;90&apos;s, that became an unexpected success in 1996 and was the movie that earned Geoffrey Rush his as of yet only Oscar win and got the movie 6 more Oscar nominations, including best director and best picture.\n\nThe movie shows how Australian born David Helfgott gets formed and influenced in his early life by his demanding and abusive father (wonderfuly played by Armin Mueller-Stahl), who is in strict control of the family. He asks a lot from the already very unstable David and influences ever step in his life, probably also to make up for his own shortcomings in life. He&apos;s an unpredictable character with two faces and you can really feel the fear he puts in the family and David in particular. Things go worse and worse mentally for David as he grows up and eventually goes to study in England at the Royal College of Music. He has a breakdown which for once and for all definitely labels him as a psychotic man. His personality could definitely been described as crazy.\n\nHe gets perfectly and beautifully portrayed by Geoffrey Rush, who truly deserved the Oscar he received for his role. But in fact he is only in the movie for perhaps halve the running time. For &quot;Shine&quot; uses lots of flashbacks about Helfgott&apos;s early life and as a young adult, when he is being played by different actors. One of those actors is the know very well known Noah Taylor, who also plays the part fine. Also really impressive is Armin Mueller-Stahl. He doesn&apos;t usually have very big parts in English spoken movies but in this movie he plays one of his bigger and more interesting roles. It&apos;s a true memorable performance from him and he also truly deserved his Oscar nomination for this movie. I keep thinking it&apos;s a great shame he got discovered so late by the big-money movie industry, since he is already close to 80 by now, which should mean that his biggest and greatest roles should already be behind him by now. But who knows, some actors just go on forever, till a very old age. Take for instance John Gielgud, who also stars in this movie. At the time he was already well over 90 years old and he would continue to play on in many more great and big productions, till his death in 2000. Some actors are just truly born as actors. It simply is in their blood and they can&apos;t stop playing.\n\nMoments in Helfgott&apos;s life are never portrayed too long but also never too short. This means that the story always comes right to the point and doesn&apos;t dance around it. The movie becomes very effective because of this and on top of that gets presented with a good steady pace. It&apos;s a reason why this movie is really one of the better autobiographic movies ever made. It&apos;s a really great directed and told movie, from Scott Hicks.\n\nBut of course like every good biopic, the movie doesn&apos;t only presents facts and some things are altered, in order to enhance the movie and its story or characters. For instance right after this movie the real Helfgott became a true full God, while in all honesty David Helfgott is a great piano player but just not the genius one as portrayed in this movie. It&apos;s kind of like the piano man. The mysterious mute man who was found in Kent England in 2005. It was said he was a brilliant piano player, while in fact he just simply knew how to play a piano well but was by no means a great or professional player. Just like David Helfgott, it are just the unusual circumstances and character personalities that makes people say they are geniuses, rather than it&apos;s an objective reflection of their actual qualities. But like I said, this isn&apos;t anything unusual to do for a biopic, to play around a little with the facts and it certainly is no objection when it actually enhances the movie. &quot;Shine&quot; truly benefits from its approach and story.\n\nI also enjoyed David Hirschfelder nice little musical score (also Oscar-nominated). Of course the movie also benefits from it&apos;s classical compositions that are being featured. It&apos;s of course a very musical movie, since it&apos;s about the life of a musician but you really don&apos;t need a classic musical lover to enjoy or to appreciate this movie though.\n\nThe movie ends quite abrupt and perhaps not satisfying enough but this is of course simply due to the fact that David Helfgot is still alive and active today. Who knows, perhaps they could had better waited for another 30 years to come up with a movie about his life, for who knows what more strange and beautiful moments his life shall know.\n\nPerhaps it&apos;s not the most stylish or greatest made movie but the combination of the interesting unique story, pace and main character (and of course Geoffrey Rush his performance of him) are what makes this movie such a basically flawless (you simply just forgive the movie for its flaws and shortcomings while you&apos;re watching it) and captivating one to watch.\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "The timing of this version of the venerable saga was highly disadvantageous, its release being so very close to &quot;the other Wyatt Earp,&quot; Tombstone. That said, it&apos;s a completely different movie. While &quot;Tombstone&quot; relied on more dramatic license and cinematic bombast, this one was far more historically accurate, right down to the decidedly period dialog. However, it was far too long for most viewers, with a pace that left much to be desired, suffering more from its extended length than any other issue with the film itself. The acting was good, with Costner his typically unemotional self. However, his supporting cast was especially good, particularly in the case of the Earp Women. Dennis Quaid was excellent, in a stunning transformation over his usual roles. Once again, his version will be certainly be compared to the superb Val Kilmer, but once again, in terms of history, one would have to describe it as more accurate. Again, a drastic editing would have made this a far better overall film experience.",

      "reviewBody": "20 July 2005. Warning: Spoiler. This movie tries to take the high road to the traditional survival story, but ends up with several low points along the way. One of the saving components of this movie was the mostly outstanding performance of Giovanni Ribisi who plays a character that seems quite out of his past range of characters as well as stereotypical one, but one that Ribisi makes his own. There are number of intellectual and explanatory narrative scenes with a number of characters using a script that attempts to elevate the level of dialogue and plot. Yet the movie at the same time suffers from manipulative script devices, continuity problems, and actions by the characters that don&apos;t seem to make much sense. There is one scene where Ribisi climbs on top of their new plane during an electrical storm. There is another scene where it&apos;s night and then suddenly it&apos;s day. There are a number of scenes where time suddenly passes and, as if by magic, the survivors&apos; problems are solved. Various equipment, food, water many vital components just appear mostly for the sake of the script. There are a number of superfluous script plots that are incorporated just for the sake of making the movie supposedly more interesting without really allowing the characters to develop and become much more personal. The characters are themselves somewhat stereotypical even though deliberate attempts are made not to be so. One of the great scenes is when Ribisi manages to take charge as well as the twist of his true nature of his employment (though the outcome of this scene is somewhat disappointment and quite predictable). There would have been more emotional intrigue if the survivors&apos; discovered that not all of them could leave because of weight considerations. All in all, this mostly predictable movie thanks in part to the trailer is interesting with some nice cinematography shots, slow motion, and other special effects has its moments. Seven out of Ten Stars.",

      "reviewBody": "Forget the critics, this is an awesome movie. It&apos;s fast-paced, action-packed and spectacular. I was tense the whole time and came out feeling like I&apos;d been holding my breath for hours.\n\nSeriously, most critics seem more interested in showing how cynical and cool they are than actually enjoying a great adventure film. I&apos;ve read lots of reviews, so I&apos;ll address a few of the complaints made.\n\nBad dialogue: It&apos;s not Shakespeare, but it sets up the relationships between characters quickly and serves the action well. It also manages to explain the basics of caving and scuba diving (which most of the audience would be unfamiliar with) without seeming too preachy.\n\nBad acting: I thought everyone was pretty great with what they had to do. Again, it&apos;s not bloody Shakespeare.\n\nPredictable: not to me. Yes, they&apos;re stuck in a cave so there&apos;s only so many things that can happen. But what does happen is really bloody exciting. I guess if you spend your whole life watching movies (as critics do) then any action movie would be predictable after a while.\n\nUnlikeable characters: Um, since when did every character have to be likable? And even if you don&apos;t particularly like a character, surely you don&apos;t want them to die a horrible death down a cave. The truth is some of the characters you really like, some grow on you and some you almost want to drown with your own bare hands. So a good mix.\n\nWeak roles for women: I disagree. The women are put in freaky situations and react in human ways. Though I didn&apos;t quite understand what happened to Victoria - that&apos;s one thing the film could have done slightly better.\n\nI&apos;ve also heard critics complain about too much swearing (seriously, if you&apos;ve ever spent time around real-life explorers they&apos;re generally not too concerned with social niceties, especially in life-or-death situations). And some reviewers complained that there were no monsters in the cave - seriously! That was what was so great about the story - it was extreme but it all could have happened. Man vs nature and vs each other - much more interesting than another monster flick.\n\nAnyway, Sanctum is excellent. Go see it.",

      "reviewBody": "There is a wall in my house. The wall is a simple wall, eight feet tall, and fifteen feet wide, it sits in a corner in the basement. It has been painted beige, with a few coats to cover up the bumps and scratches from coats before. It&apos;s got it&apos;s idiosyncrasies, the way the light jumps off the paint, the not so even drywalling underneath. Stare at it long enough, and it begins to speak to you - or at least allow you to speak to it. Maybe there&apos;s something to the wall - or maybe it&apos;s just my romantic illusions of inspiration and contemplation that bring life to it. My point is this - staring at that blank wall for two hours is far more inspiring, interesting and enlightening than watching even just two minutes of the cinematic colonoscopy that is &quot;Cats.&quot; A film so awful, so ridiculous and so void of substance its very existence is an affront to musicals, film and theatre. Unless you&apos;re a fan of &apos;so bad it&apos;s good&apos; cinema, stay away. This is a watershed moment in bad movie history."

Aided by her doctor, she attempts to unravel the terrible secret behind her scary supernatural power.\n\nDirected by David Moreau and Xavier Palud, The Eye is a totally unnecessary and dreary remake that copies parts of original verbatim, alters scenes that should have been left well alone (the creepy cafe meat-licking scene has gone, and the downbeat ending has been swapped for a typical Hollywood crowd pleaser), and totally botches what should be the scariest bit of the whole film (the lift scene is VERY disappointing).\n\nTake my advice: If you&apos;ve already seen Gin gwai, then stay away from The Eye.",

      "reviewBody": "To begin with, I would like to thank @dioptrabooks , feelgoodentment and @MtvGreece for giving me two tickets for the first screening of #VampireAcademy in Greece! The event was held in a cinema in Abelokipous, Athens and we were like 300 fans, or something! It was insane and we, the fans, started getting crazy as we were counting down till the beginning of the movie. \n\nIn my opinion, Vampire Academy, is one of the best movie adaptations I&apos;ve ever seen, since the #TwilightSaga #BreakingDawn part 2. Do not get me wrong; the film has nothing to do with sparkling vampires. The plot line itself was totally different. Let alone the fact that, I have read the books so I knew what I was about to watch. \n\nThe movie&apos;s plot line stays true to the book&apos;s one, but some kick-arse changes occurred and the movie turned out to be more spectacular than expected. Unfortunately, though, the beginning of the movie felt like it was happening really fast. To be honest, had I not read the books, I&apos;d be confused about the three types of vampires (Moroi, Dhampir, Strigoi).\n\nI should probably add that I had my doubts about both the director and the script-writer of Vampire Academy but the film flowed smoothly and it kept you captive its passing minute since there were many interesting changes, as I&apos;ve already mentioned. \n\nAll in all, Vampire Academy is a movie for all ages. It is anything you want to see: action, comedy and thriller. The combination is simply mesmerizing!\n\nABOUT THE ACTORS/ACTRESSES: \n\nZoey Deutch: She was extremely good. I remember myself saying that they shouldn&apos;t have chosen her for Rose&apos;s part but now I understand why they did so. She simply rocks!\n\nLucy Fry: It felt like Lissa&apos;s character was written based on her! Many said that she got them bored and all but hello.it&apos;s Lissa Dragomir we&apos;re talking about! I was constantly mad at her while reading the books! :P\n\nDom Sherwood: OMG! I LOST COUNT ON HOW MANY EYGASMS I GOT! He&apos;s the hottest vampire (after Robert Pattinson, of course) I have seen! Like the previous members of the cast, his rocked it!\n\nThe creepiness that was coming out of Christian was there. I found myself be like, &quot;OMG What&apos;s he going to do? Is he gonna hurt her? Look at this mysterious expression.&quot; It was like I was reading/watching the book for the first time. Like, everything around me was focused on him\n\nDANILA KOZLOVSKY: with a couple of words: HE IS OUR Russian GOD! Simple as it is! OMG! When he was getting some training done I was gazing up at him like gawk! His performance was remarkable and he spoke fluently English.!"

If i talk much more i&apos;ll end up giving the thing away, so i&apos;ll leave you with this- it&apos;s a wonderful movie for kids, and, for hose adults who haven&apos;t seen it, when watching, keep in mind that this is a children&apos;s movie:) enjoy!!",

      "reviewBody": "THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO has got to be one of the most original and inventive of all the films Woody Allen has done--and all the more enjoyable because we&apos;re not subjected to the Allen character in the film itself. Instead, we get MIA FARROW (one of her very best performances) and JEFF DANIELS in what has to be the most original role of his career, as the man who walks off the movie screen and into Farrow&apos;s humdrum life.\n\nFarrow is the Depression-era movie fan whose film idol walks right off the screen and interjects himself into her life--brightening it, at least for awhile, until the rather downbeat ending. DANNY AIELLO, as Mia&apos;s abusive husband and DIANNE WIEST have good supporting roles, but the story really depends on the wonderful chemistry between Farrow and Daniels--and they truly bring the bittersweet comedy and fantasy to credible life.\n\nFurthermore, the script is not only very clever, but the film is technically brilliant in the way it has the film within a film characters on the screen interacting with the movie audience.\n\nSumming up: Stylish mixture of comedy and fantasy, fully deserving the many nominations and awards it won that year.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Katheryn Bigelow does a wonderful job of creating a great deal of tension. She does so by cutting from one tightly framed slightly wobbly shot to the next. Each character&apos;s face floods nearly the entire screen after each of these cuts. This makes the movie deeply personal and almost claustrophobic at times. The slight wobbles of the camera as it focuses on a face, adds to the uneasiness and unstable nature of the situation.\n\nWhat I&apos;m saying is the movie is expertly directed. That&apos;s evident early on and remains that way throughout. The issue holding this movie back from becoming one of serious best picture caliber is the writing. The story felt a bit underdeveloped.\n\nThe brief on-screen text explanation of the tension between the Detroit Police and the city&apos;s black residents could have served as a helpful addition to a setup that followed in the movie. I would have had no problem with that. But after the movie plays for 20 minutes or so, I realized that the text was the sole source of setup.\n\nThat&apos;s a classic case of telling instead of showing. Movies are a video medium. Use that. Don&apos;t casually display the text on screen. This choice may have been made for the sake of time, but I think the filmmakers would have been wise to focus more on the setup aspect. The text explanation felt like an inconsiderate means of storytelling.\n\nAfter the opening text, the movie meanders for a while, eventually introducing the key characters and providing an appetizer of their personalities, foreshadowing their upcoming behavior.\n\nMoments like these showcased strengths in the writing. The writing did not completely ruin the movie; it simply was not an Oscar-contending performance, like Bigelow&apos;s work.\n\nThe movie overall is well made, thanks in large part to Bigelow&apos;s deft direction, but it&apos;s not without flaws. One that I already mentioned is that I wanted the actual movie (not solely text) to better set the stage of this city that&apos;s on the verge of riot.\n\nThe second criticism ties into the first. Because of the lack of stage setting, this becomes a movie that expertly depicts the what, but fails to fully deliver on the why.\n\nI see the riots. I see the emotional toll that police misconduct had on the abused citizens. I see the guilt that certain uniformed personnel felt for standing by and allowing the abuse to take place. What I didn&apos;t see enough of is why all this happened. I wanted a more personal detailing of what led up to the night shown in the movie. The actions are clear and powerful, but the motivations are vague and weak.\n\nI came away from the movie wondering what message the filmmakers hoped to convey. While the title is Detroit, the story has a much narrower focus. Were the clear majority of Detroit City Police Officers upstanding in their behavior, with only a few tragic bad apples? Given the choice focus on only a few officers and a select group of citizens, should I assume that these officers&apos; misconduct was the norm or the exception? \n\nPerhaps it was not the filmmakers&apos; intent to answer these questions. Maybe they only wanted to tell this specific story, without greater implications, which is fine. I just personally wanted to see a broader depiction of the city&apos;s atmosphere leading up to, during, and following the riots.",

It is not something really great, but it soothes the soul like one of those old road books.\n\nThe story itself is more of a three parter, each section detailing a mindset and the situations that define it. You see the hopeless romantic, the one person who let the other inside instead of just sticking to the outside, and for whom losing the other is worst than death; then there is the rebellious daughter that loves and hates her father until it&apos;s to late to do anything either way; and of course, the story of Nora Joneses and Jude Law&apos;s characters.\n\nBottom line: lay comfy in your bed and listen to the slow rhythms of the music while digesting the human nature presented in the film.

      "reviewBody": "There are loads of negative reviews on this film so I&apos;m here to give a slightly more positive one.\n\nI enjoyed this film. I thought it was funny, entertaining, and the plot was not too predictable. Also, the acting was very impressive.\n\nI watched this on a saturday night, and it made my evening very enjoyable. It&apos;s not supposed to be an intellectually challenging film, it&apos;s supposed to make you laugh. And it made me laugh a lot. The jokes were well played out, and the main characters were phenomenally acted, and sure- some of the jokes were immature and childish but that was part of the charm of this movie.\n\nBased off of all of the other reviews I had read before watching I was expecting a really mundane film and it wasn&apos;t. The plot line was interesting, and even though there were one or two serious scenes I was still very much hooked on what was going on.\n\nThis film made me properly laugh out loud, and I really did enjoy it. Sure it wasn&apos;t incredible cinematography, and it didn&apos;t leave me thinking about the meaning of existence like many of Johanssons more notable films, but it was very enjoyable, and I would watch it again with friends. In fact, this film for me was even with how much I enjoyed bridesmaids, and maybe it&apos;s because I love Kate McKinnon and Scarlett Johansson, but I still think that despite the negative reviews this film deserves more love as the laid back comedy it is.",

This film was was supposed to come out in August, then pulled to December, and now it&apos;s released in February. Please see this film!!! I found it very uplifting. The performances of Asa Butterfield, Britt Robertson, Gary Oldman, Carla Gugino, and BD Wong are fantastic.

      "reviewBody": "Emir Kusturica&apos;s films all pulsate wildly to the wonderful sounds of authentic gypsy music. Guitars, fiddles, accordians and all manor of horns are as much a part of their lives as eating and sleeping.\n\nSong and dance feature heavily in &quot;Black Cat, White Cat,&quot; Kustruica&apos;s finest and most complete film to date. The music isn&apos;t really a soundtrack, but is largely, physically written into each scene (performed with gusto by musicians who often follow the characters around). Indeed, the &apos;bad-guy&apos; character of Dadan scarcely has a scene where he isn&apos;t swinging or dancing along to something (even a bizarre pop/rock song makes a comic cameo). But the other characters have their musical moments as well.\n\n&quot;Black Cat, White Cat&quot; has a large cast and a sprawling storyline, largely resolving around two gangsters - Dadan and the hapless Marko - and their attempts to outwit each other. Things come to a head when Dadan tries to force Marko&apos;s son to marry his spinster sister as a repayment for one of his father&apos;s debts.\n\nBut the plot is largely unimportant in a film of this type. The viewer is simply swept away in a good natured deluge of funny lines, inventive slap-stick, unusual settings and colourful supporting characters (a particular favourite: the old man who continually re-watches the last two minutes of &quot;Casablanca&quot;). All you need to do is sit back and enjoy. Oh...and listen to the music.",

Her character is so immature, entitled and emotional that it ruins the movie. This is because it isnt believable that someone of high intellect would act like that and its just annoyying to watch.\n\nThe dialogue between Jennifer Lopes character and the good AI also seems like an advertisement for AI because the movie is portraiting the good AI as a loyal human friend.\n\nThe best part of the movie is Mark Strongs acting and character. He has a small role but does it well.\n\nThe CGI is great and camera, music and sound is just fine. So you will experience some nice sci fi watching this.\n\n6/10 For the CGI.",

      "reviewBody": "The celebrity biographer Lee Israel was in her own way an expert spinner of &quot;alternative facts&quot; and &quot;fake news&quot; decades before both became commonplace in the digital age. Plenty of people who should have known better were willing to accept these &quot;facts&quot; and spread this &quot;news.&quot;\n\nMelissa McCarthy reaches an artistic career peak with her performance as the late writer who had been one of the top names in her field in the 70s and early 80s before cultural evolution (or devolution, depending on how you look at it) combined with her own abrasiveness and alcoholism led publishers to shun her work. McCarthy adapts her familiar techniques perfectly to this particular character.\n\nWith bills mounting, and facing loss of prestige and income, she began drinking heavily and sinking into a deep, almost psychotic, depression when, half by chance, she discovered that a lot of money could be made by selling letters from famous people like Katharine Hepburn and Fanny Brice. The juicier the content, the more cash they commanded. A talented and witty writer herself, she was familiar enough with the style of the such figures as Noel Coward and Dorothy Parker to forge imitations that convinced professional collectors of their authenticity. Quotes from some of her fakes even ended up in respectable publications. Eventually she resorted to doctoring correspondence which she stole from libraries and selling the results for high prices to sometimes shady dealers. Here was someone who loved and respected outstanding writers and their works but was driven by circumstance to, in effect, falsifying their legacies.\n\nSome of the little touches that deepen our understanding of her character include a scene where she is watching the 1941 film version of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; and starts delivering the dialogue along with the actors and even accurately imitating Bette Davis&apos;s distinctive giggle. Much of the time she is swilling scotch and her ever-so-slightly slurred speech reflects this half-inebriated state.\n\nThe movie is shot in New York, making use of locations that still look much as they did more than a quarter of a century ago, when the classic New York of the early-to-mid 20th century, an environment conducive to Israel&apos;s own earlier success, had mostly faded out. Julius, the bar where a few key scenes are set, existed then and still exists now. (A conversation therein about her illegal shenanigans is softly underscored by Marlene Dietrich&apos;s recording of &quot;Illusions,&quot; Dietrich being the subject of one of Israel&apos;s Noel Coward forgeries.)\n\nMost of the interiors (book stores, archives, Israel&apos;s funky apartment, her agent&apos;s more elegant and expansive one) are genuine.\n\nMcCarthy is strongly supported by Richard E. Grant in a showy, colorful performance as a fellow alcoholic and partner in crime, Stephen Spinella as a kind but increasingly suspicious rare book dealer, Brandon Scott Jones as a fussy book store clerk who, to his regret, rubs Israel the wrong way, Jane Curtin as her no-nonsense literary agent, Anna Deveare Smith as an old friend and numerous others.\n\n&quot;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&quot;, based on and named after Israel&apos;s slender autobiographical recap of this period, is a highly intelligent and detailed rendering of a complex human being, by turns endearing and repulsive, brilliant and stupid."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Suzume,&quot; directed by Makoto Shinkai, is an enchanting animated film that masterfully blends elements of fantasy, adventure, and deeper emotional themes. Renowned for his previous works like &quot;Your Name&quot; and &quot;Weathering with You,&quot; Shinkai continues to showcase his signature style in this beautifully crafted story.\n\nThe film follows the journey of a young girl named Suzume, who stumbles upon a mysterious door in the mountains of Kyushu. This door leads to other worlds and opens up an array of adventures, but it also unleashes chaos that she must confront. Accompanied by a young man named Souta, her quest transforms into a race against time as they seek to close the doors to prevent disasters from affecting their reality.\n\nAs expected from a Shinkai film, the animation in &quot;Suzume&quot; is nothing short of breathtaking. The vibrant landscapes of Japan, combined with meticulously detailed backgrounds, create an immersive world that draws the viewer in. The motion and fluidity of animated sequences are coupled with stunning visual effects that highlight the film&apos;s fantastical elements, making every frame a work of art.\n\nSuzume is a relatable protagonist whose emotional depth resonates throughout the film. Her character evolves dramatically as she grapples with her past, the losses she faces, and the responsibility that comes with her journey. Souta&apos;s character complements Suzume beautifully, bringing in a dynamic that balances humor and seriousness. The supporting characters, including Suzume&apos;s friends and family, add richness to her story, offering insights into her motivations and struggles.\n\nAt its core, &quot;Suzume&quot; explores themes of grief, connection, and the importance of confronting one&apos;s emotions. The door symbolizes both opportunity and the consequences of one&apos;s choices, serving as a metaphor for how we deal with the past and the steps we take to move forward. The film touches on the impact of natural disasters, intergenerational trauma, and personal growth, providing not just entertainment but also deep reflections that linger after the credits roll.\n\nThe musical score, crafted by the renowned musician Radwimps, enhances the emotional impact of the film. The soundtrack expertly blends with the visuals, guiding viewers through the highs and lows of Suzume&apos;s journey, adding layers of emotional depth. The songs are memorable and beautifully complement the narrative, further immersing the audience in her world.\n\n&quot;Suzume&quot; is a poignant and visually stunning film that appeals to both animation lovers and general audiences. It captures the essence of human emotions through the lens of fantasy and adventure, leaving viewers with a lasting impression. Makoto Shinkai proves once again that he is a master storyteller, and &quot;Suzume&quot; stands out as a testament to his genius. Whether you&apos;re a fan of his previous works or new to his films, &quot;Suzume&quot; is a cinematic experience that should not be missed.",

I could not take my eyes off this movie, even though it is very hard to look at &apos;cause the look of Lily Collins and her co stars in the Strashhold are close to unbearable. But that is how it is so a story like this needed to be told. (Just like with 13 Reasons Why)\n\nEveryone&apos;s performance is amazing and true to the characters. This needs to be seen, there are scenes that will make you bawl and probably help you being grounded more. It is also funny when it wants to be, which is not that often. \n\nLoves this, waited for it for a year and it was worth it."

The characters are older but still gave nice performances and the new characters weren&apos;t awful.\n\nMost sequels fail to live up to the original film and you know this before sitting down but that doesn&apos;t mean they aren&apos;t fun to watch. I personally liked seeing the characters brought back and can honestly say that I enjoyed the experience. In my opinion, had the 1993 original not been made, simply cutting the references to it would&apos;ve made this a fine stand alone film.\n\nTo each their own.",

      "reviewBody": "Having seen all these actors in earlier flicks I thought I knew what I had in store. I was wrong. I laughed like silly where one shouldn&apos;t laugh and enjoyed the movie immensely. It is set in a typical Danish village but there is nothing typical about the inhabitants. The priest has a way with people which even the Bee Gees can&apos;t dilute. The doctor has this wonderful Danish dialect which all you non-Danish speaking people will miss out on, but still he will be very funny to you all. It&apos;s hard to compare this film to any other, but maybe it owes something to &quot;They Eat Dogs in China&quot;. And who would have thought that &quot;A Half Kennedy&quot; is a medical term? If you are only going to see one Nordic movie this decade, don&apos;t miss out on this one!",

      "reviewBody": "After months of slogging through big-budget, special effects studio films that were just &quot;fine&quot; all summer, I&apos;ve finally encountered a hidden gem that is well worth watching.\n\nANTHROPOID is a World War II film starring Cillian Murphy that tells the true tale of a group of Czech resistance fighters on a mission (Codenamed ANTHROPOID) to assassinate Nazi SS General Reinhard Heydrich, the &quot;Butcher of Prague&quot;. \n\nDirector and writer Sean Ellis (The Proposal) really breaks through in this taught thriller that is part drama, part thriller and part action movie. Ellis creates a group of real people (the drama part of the film) with real relationships operating undercover in a very dangerous situation (the thriller part) in order to carry out orders to assassinate the #3 in command of the German hierarchy (the action part).\n\nSome will find the first hour of the movie a bit slow as Ellis builds up his characters and their relationships. This turns out to be an important slow burn build-up and really pays off as the action starts heating up the screen and you are really invested in what happens to these people.\n\nThe acting is top-notch starting with Murphy, who I looked at in this movie and wondered why he isn&apos;t a bigger star. As Mission Leader Josef Gabcik, he is strongly focused on the mission only to find out the real human consequences of his actions along the way. He is ably assisted by Jamie Dornan (who proves there is a real actor underneath the 50 Shades of Gray) as his partner who needs to find the courage to go through with the mission and the always reliable Toby Jones as the head of the Czech underground. These 3 known (at least to me) stars are joined by strong European actors/actresses, most notably Marcin Dorocinski (as a reluctant Resistance fighter), Alena Mihulava (as the woman who hides the resistance fighters), and Harry Lloyd (the ranking Czech officer). Most impressive to me is the work of Czech actress Anna Geislerova (as another resistance fighter). I could not take my eyes off of her when she was on the screen, so had to look her up. She has over 100 credits, none of which is widely known to US audiences (mostly Czech films). I would love to see her do other things.\n\nThe acting is good, the script/drama is tight and the action (once it is started) is terrific, showing just enough that you know where everyone is in relation to the others, what they are doing and what peril they are in. Director Ellis avoids going &quot;overboard&quot; and the action is all the better for it. The big studios could learn a thing or two about &quot;less is more&quot; from this film. \n\nI really enjoyed this one - it was a welcome break from the onslaught of special effects that has become the norm in the summer - and I STRONGLY recommend it to you.\n\nA strong 8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",

There are some distressing scenes (sexual assault, violence) that were acted brilliantly.\n\nThe silence throughout the movie added to the intensity and put the viewer firmly into the mindset of the main character (Martha), who was excellently portrayed by Elizabeth Olsen.\n\nSarah Paulson (I should add I am biased towards her as she is an exquisite human) added depth and a gentleness that was required for the character of Martha to explore her situation in the scenes between them.\n\nThe aspect and post production on this was beautiful, the lighting throughout was spot on. The way that many scenes in the &apos;cult&apos; were in near darkness contrasting to the light filled space once she left gave excellent visual cues and a sense of the tumultuous emotions being felt by Martha.\n\nWould definitely watch again to see if there were background things I&apos;ve missed.",

Utterly sublime direction from Jarmusch, with a sense of desolation in the landscape that is captured so well, it&apos;s almost surreal. Waits is, simply put, a genius, and puts in a performance which would silence any who feel that &quot;you can&apos;t be both an actor and a musician&quot;. Benigni and Lurie are both a delirius joy and deliciously despicable respectively. The use of Waits&apos; music within the film only heightens the sense of dusty Americana, and hip oddball style. It reminds me that indie-film snobs have actually got something right for a change, and its cult classic status is rightly deserved. Exquisitely shot, with an excellent soundtrack and sterling performances. Highly recommended, especially for fans of Waits and Benigny. Also, it&apos;s the only film that makes me want ice cream...."

      "reviewBody": "This is a truly great film and well deserving of the Palm D&apos;Or.\n\nIt has been said that it is pro IRA or IRA propaganda. I disagree. In fact I think the reverse is the case. It shows up both the brutality of war and the even greater brutality of civil war that sets nation against nation and brother against brother. The film provides an understanding of how Ireland became independent in 1920-1921. It is well documented (e.g. visit the BBC or CAIN websites) that the Black and Tans were a brutal and oppressive irregular force sent to put down the rebellion. The IRA reacted with similar brutality. The film records both with equally graphic scenes. But that is only the first half of the film. The second half deals with the civil war. That&apos;s even more tragic and brutal.\n\nWho was on the right side or the wrong side? The film presents the arguments but I really don&apos;t think the film takes sides. More of the anti British and anti treaty argument is advanced. But this is understandable because it is historically accurate that West Cost was ferociously anti British and mainly anti treaty. That&apos;s why Michael Collins was destined to die there. And it is more important to understand why people/nations go to war or civil war rather than why they don&apos;t.\n\nUnderstanding the reasons does not mean support for war. The film highlights the futility and awfulness of war. Misery destruction and death. Is there such a thing as a just war (apart from 2nd World war)? Aside from the historical debate, the story, filming and acting is magnificent. Much better than the Green Berets on the just war by USA in Vietnam! Blackhawk Down brilliantly covered Somalia from the external US perspective. This film brilliantly covers the 1920/21 wars from the Irish perspective. We need all perspectives.\n\nWell worth seeing with an open mind. Then read the history if you want.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the movie of my life !\n\nI never before saw a film that i could identify myself so much with. I´m lucky enough to live in a place near the sea very similar and as beautiful as those in the movie and the opening scenes always remind me of my teenage years and the waters i explored like young Jaqques Mayol does in the beginning of the movie. Things that i still do. So i immediatley related to the character and its love for the ocean.\n\nI guess that´s the beauty of this movie. It makes us feel that we could be any of its characters, because they´re so real. We almost can´t believe that they don´t exist outside of the movie. This is an amazing ,beautifuly well written ,acted, photographed and directed movie ! It carries us into an extraordinary world, and it´s our world !! (mine at least to some point) Not some hollywood depiction of reality !\n\nBut what it´s about it ? This is the worst thing anyone can ask about this movie.\n\nI would hate to be the guy who had to publicize this in USA. And i can see why it failed there.\n\nBut what can i say about it?... That it´s the story of two friends who compete to find out who´s best ?...It´s more than that ! That it´s a love story ? It goes beyond every love story ! That it´s an adventure ? You bet it is ! But it has no action, no chases,no dangerous cliffangers, no guns and no explosions. It doesn´t even has bad guys ! Or good guys in fact. That it´s a travel or a road movie ? Probably. This movie has better locations than any James Bond movie will ever get and they´re all real !\n\nBut they don´t matter much compared to the characters in the film. The characters then... There´s a hero right ?... Well there´s two of them. Two men. But they´re not heroes.\n\nProbably the hero is a woman who sacrifices her happiness for love. So, there´s a woman and two men. There´s got to be a love triangle there to cause all those love story rivalary subplots, right ? Well, there´s a love triangle, but there aren´t subplots attached to it. In fact the love triangle has more than three people. All characters are a part of it realy. Including dolphins ! Even the ocean.\n\nAha ! So this is some sort of a kinky erotic and exotic movie thing ? Wrong ! There´s sex in it, but not in that way at all.\n\nIt´s a comedy then... You´ll laugh, but you´ll cry too. It´s a drama ... Not in the conventional cliché way. Not at all. A dramatic comedy... Nope !\n\nIt´s a sci-fi film !... Well there´s scientists in it, and deep underwater, and even under ice diving scenes, but it´s not a scifi film, although the American &quot;version&quot; Movie Trailler presented it like if it were some new esotheric adventure underwater sci-fi horror movie, when in fact it is not.\n\nSo what is this movie about ?!!\n\nIt´s about what you want it to be. About what you´re feeling. It´s that open. You just have to feel it.\n\nAs Luc Besson said in an interview, at some point in the movie he was stuck, because he didn´t know how to carry the audience inside.\n\nThen the real Jaqques Mayol, who worked in the film as a diving and story consultant took Besson diving with him one day and made him experience the sea in his way. Then Besson understood that he didn´t had to explain anything to the audience. He just had to make people feel what it was like !\n\nAnd boy, did he make it ! The atmosphere in this movie goes beyond words. It has to be felt ! Also the soundtrack is out of this world and trully magical.\n\nTo me this film is about love, but in a much deeper meaning than the usual. Beyond race, beyond gender, beyond sex, beyond nationality. Love as an emotion. And about freedom !\n\nSo get a wide screen TV and a full blast surround. This movie is the reason to buy one if you don´t have it! Believe me ! And watch it in the dark.\n\nTry to get the european full version of the movie. The american is not that terrible, the feeling is there, but it´s diferent from the original.\n\nThis movie is a masterpiece ! ( in any version )",

One may wonder where they come up with that stuff and ideas. But I&apos;m happy they do and I happily watch them too.\n\nLike this one, that keeps you guessing from the start to the finish. Certainly some decisions may feel akward or wrong that characters take, but that is just how things work. Also it will make sense (more or less) in the end. Keep guessing, keep trying to figure out where this goes - it&apos;s almost impossible I&apos;d say. Unless you&apos;ve read a synopsis and even then, it had to be quite thorough ... so I urge go in this without reading too much about it and enjoy the thriller you are being served ... and the enticing story with it ... I don&apos;t totally agree with the ending this chooses, but it makes sense with the sensibilities and the mood overall ...",

She marries Larry Maretto (Matt Dillon), whose father owns a restaurant, and convinces him to use this savings for the university buying a Mustang for her and a condo. Then she accepts to work for the local station receiving minimum wage to develop her own projects, including one with youths in a public school. She meets the punks Jimmy Emmett (Joaquin Phoenix), Russel Hines (Casey Affleck) and Lydia Mertz (Alison Folland) and records hours of tapes interviewing them. When Larry invites her to work at the restaurant in a talent show that he wants to implement, Suzanne sees a threat to her planned career and decides to get rid of her husband. She seduces Jimmy and convinces him that she is in love with him. Then she tells that Larry is a brutal man and Jummy decides to kill him. What will happen to Larry?\n\n&quot;To Die For&quot; is a great tale of ambition and manipulation. Gus Van Sant uses the documentary style to show a beautiful and sexy woman that uses her limited intelligence and her body to reach what she has planned for her career. The cast has great performance and Nicole Kidman is perfect in the role of Suzanne Stone. The screenplay has a sort of black humor and the conclusion is ironical. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Um Sonho Sem Limites&quot; (&quot;A Dream Without Limits&quot;)\n\nNote: On 19 March 2025, I saw this film again.",

I love Andrew Garfield, his performance was believable and I think he&apos;s one one of the best rising stars of Hollywood. I also loved his work in &quot;Breathe&quot;, great movie, make sure you check it out. \n\nThe storyline is a bit weird, and it&apos;s pretty much centered around Andrews character, so the movie felt a bit small to me, but Andrew performance makes up for it big time. I also loved the nudity in this movie. I would describe this movie as playful, curious, funny and authentic. This is not the usual Hollywood crap, it&apos;s quite different, I had no idea where the story was going, which is a good thing because it kept me hooked and that doesn&apos;t happen to me very often anymore. I truly had a great time. It&apos;s not for everyone I think but if you like semi thriller/detective/humor/absurdity kind of movies, we&apos;ll get yourself a bucket of popcorn and have fun! \n\n(English is not my native language)",

      "reviewBody": "Great Mouse Detective is one of the best Disney movies I&apos;ve seen yet. The animation is that classic Disney style and (thank Goodness) it lacks all of those annoying songs. \n\nAs a true Sherlockian, I can only say that this is as good as it gets as far as Holmes goes. No matter what everyone says, It is still great. Kids may not get some parts f it, but every Sherlockian knows what&apos;s going on. While Ratigan may be no Moriarty, he&apos;s still the perfect example of the classic Disney villain. \n\nVincent Price is a terrific actor, and Alan Young as Flaversham was the perfect fit. Young Susanne Pollatschek is the perfect Olivia and no one could do a better Basil than Barrie Ingham. Val Bettin makes a lovable Dawson. Fidget is the classic evil crony. \n\nThis is absolutely a must see. For all you baby-sitters out there, and I know from personal experience, take this to your next job and the kids won&apos;t even blink for over an hour. It&apos;s one of the most memorable Disney movies of it&apos;s age. Although Beauty and the Beast will always be my favorite, GMD runs an extremely close second! \n\nI give it 11/10! It&apos;s that good!\n\nI always say when I write these, I loved this movie, but you may not. So how do you decide if you like it? See it! Form your own opinion! After all, one man&apos;s trash and all like that! Hope you find a good one!"

      "name": "Deep meaning and stylish art by Cronenberg.",
      "reviewBody": "Elliot and Beverly Mantle (Jeremy Irons) are identical twins that are top-of-the-class and incredibly well known gynaecologists. They also treat themselves by swapping their identities around, so they can share each other&apos;s work commitments and pleasures, like woman. But all of this comes back to destroy them emotionally and physically.\n\nAn intriguing and rather inventive premise director / co-writer David Cronenberg has come up with here. The worlds Cronenberg creates in his film&apos;s are rather fascinating in looking at the human body and technology. This film is no exception. So you can&apos;t really call this mainstream, as it&apos;s not for everyone&apos;s tastes. That&apos;s why his films seem to have great impact in the realistic visuals and material context. It&apos;s flowing with originality, good psychological elements, erotica and it holds such an artistic feel with its stunning visuals and elegance to show.\n\nThis thought-provoking drama is rather stimulating and quite downbeat. Though, it&apos;s mostly a talkative film; the dialogue is dense on many levels that it&apos;s truly captivating. It&apos;s more the material context that tries to shock and explore in a subtle way rather than the horrific visuals and shocks that we come to expect from most of Cronenberg&apos;s films. It doesn&apos;t contain much graphic moments, only about one or two. The sub-plots are drawn up quite well with dabbling in sexual desires and pleasure, technology (instruments and tools of the trade), the twins physical bond, addiction and a rather modernistic world. It&apos;s filled with sharp and intense sequences that are entrenched with an effective music score, as it overwhelmingly draws you in. This unsettling aurora builds into paranoia in the last half of the film and it ends rather disturbingly. The stylish production valves are incredibly glossy and professional. With beautifully crafted and slick cinematography. The gloomy colours that fill the screen hold great contrast in the moody and detail backdrop. From their fashionable home to their cold work office.\n\nJeremy Iron gives a tremendously charismatic performance playing both Elliot and Beverly Mantle. Elliot is Beverly&apos;s backbone as he&apos;s confident and arrogant. Beverly is the opposite as he&apos;s more innocent and rather sweet. Beverly wants to break the bond that they share, but Elliot can&apos;t let that happen. At first they weren&apos;t that likable, but the further the film goes along we see their downfall and there spiral into madness. That&apos;s when you start to feel for them and it gets rather emotionally charged. They also live and depend on each other, feeling what the other one feels and that&apos;s mostly pain and gloom here. This happens when they start to depend on painkillers and Beverly believing his girlfriend is cheating on him. This portrait shows how fragile they really are and how we really depend and feel when love ones are in pain and sorrow. As we are effected in the same way too. Genevieve Bujold is splendid as Claire Niveau the movie star and Beverly&apos;s love interest.\n\nMaybe the film was a bit overlong, but this is a shockingly grim and efficient film that plays on many levels of the mind.",

      "name": "Delightful Comic Romantic Romp",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Casanova&quot; is a delightful comic farce that uses a period setting for an amusing cross between &quot;The Princess Bride,&quot; &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and the spirit of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (not at all &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; that is based on the same legend).\n\nDirector Lasse Hallström gets the romantic romp tone right here, compared to what he did not achieve in &quot;Chocolat.&quot; He establishes from the opening that this is just fun opera buffo, with frequent sight gags and commedia dell&apos;arte troupes and Punch and Judy-type puppet shows broadly commenting on the action, though it took four writers to stitch together the broad double entendres and winks at Shakespeare, from, appropriately, &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot;, to &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; to &quot;Taming of the Shrew.&quot;\n\nHeath Ledger has grown up since he first demonstrated he had the light touch for romantic comedy in the teen version of &quot;Shrew,&quot; &quot;10 Things I Hate About You,&quot; and he&apos;s much more confident now. One of the cute conceits of the film is that the women are the aggressors, especially the virgins and novices. As the title character, he modestly claims that his success is solely due to his ability to submit. While he&apos;s not particularly leonine in the frequent shots of him lounging on a divan, he is dashing as he runs around Venice taking on several different mistaken identities. If his clinch with Jake Gyllenhaal in &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; wouldn&apos;t already qualify him for an MTV Best Kiss this year, the big one with Sienna Miller could earn a nomination.\n\nMiller is a bit young for her role as a Portia-like &quot;transvestite&quot; philosopher defending the rights of women, but her youth makes her brash earnestness seem more charmingly naïve. As her lively mother, Lena Olin provides the older woman ballast, without the usual sex-starved widow stereotypes.\n\nOliver Platt should be signed immediately to do a major production of &quot;Falstaff,&quot; as he deftly and physically plays that character type, here a lard mogul representative of mercantile Genoa, even more deliciously and sympathetically than he has in &quot;Ice Harvest&quot; and &quot;Huff.&quot;\n\nJeremy Irons has fun playing the Inquisitor, representing religious Rome, whose purple robes fit right in at a carnivale masquerade ball.\n\nThe look of the film helps enormously, with the best use of Venice as a sensuously unique setting since &quot;Dangerous Beauty,&quot; not just for the usual gondolas and canals, but the steps, plazas, architecture, roofs, narrow streets, alleys and the light. The wigs and costumes are wonderfully colorful.\n\nThe marvelous stitching together of Baroque music keeps the mood merry, with overtures and dances from eight Jean-Philippe Rameau operas, six Italian composers, including of course Vivaldi, as well as snatches of Handel and Telemann added at appropriate water and fireworks moments.",

Sounds funny at beginning , but it&apos;s more easy to bring audience into the story with characters . Zhangyimou&apos;s movie are famous for bright colors and nice view since he use to be cameraman. But this movie is so much more than the visual! Color still pretty though, the paper shop, those QiPao, girls make-up , everything is pretty . I guess to ruin the beautiful things defines the tragedy. My friend who watched it before told me do not watched it in the morning , because it will upset you whole day. So I went to cinema in the afternoon, and I could sleep until 5 am this morning. Comparing to Zhang Yi Mou&apos;s earlier work like &quot; hero&quot;, this is definitely his best work in 10years!",

Far too much corny, obvious humor (Topher Grace&apos;s car, Quaid discovering a pregnancy test box in the garbage) is redeemed by Quaid&apos;s nearly faultless performance. Never one to be scaled down without an effort, Quaid admirably gives himself over to this role; he doesn&apos;t chew the scenery (as Jeff Bridges might) and he doesn&apos;t go for broad personal affects (as Nicolas Cage might). In fact, he&apos;s perfect. Topher Grace has a difficult role (almost villainous--nobody likes THE BOSS), but he doesn&apos;t resort to sniveling and has many successful scenes. As Quaid&apos;s eldest daughter, luminous Scarlett Johansson has developed some actorly tics that I&apos;m not fond of (faraway looks and smiles, confusion and curiosity always undercut by wistfulness), yet she does wonders with a thankless role. **1/2 from ****",

Yet I was at the edge of my seat over whether the hero and the heroine would get together. The incidents have no fantasy, no action chase scenes, no amazing settings, just everyday life at a seaside town, a boarding house and a school. It reminds me of Ocean Waves, another Ghibli movie that I absolutely adore. In comparison, the average Hollywood romantic movie seems so loud and garish. The actors and actresses in typical Hollywood rom-coms are the cartoons, not these animated people I&apos;ve grown to care about in the span of an hour and a half. What are comparable movies? In the Mood for Love, from Hong Kong, and Scorsese&apos;s The Age of Innocence. I&apos;m in love again.",

Songs are the worst part in the movie. After every 10 mins one song is there to irritate you. I mean why we have to be reliable on songs when you have a good story. Poor direction,worst screenplay intact sometimes dialogues also gets bored while watching the movie. Only Ranbir Kapoor performance was great &amp; Vaani Kapoor dance performance was good.

If you haven&apos;t seen it, it may seem to be corny or &quot;hokey&quot; in a few places but get past that because behind it are a set of story lines that will grab you by the library of your literary innards and hold them attentively until the credits roll.\n\nJesse L. Martin, known on the small screen for his role Detective Ed Green since 1999, is one of the stars who will send auditory shockwaves your way with his beautiful voice. I had no idea he could sing and oh yes! He can definitely sing.\n\nThe lyrics throughout the production are unforgettable and must be listened to. This segment of, &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; sets the theme for the movie and rings true for us all.\n\n&quot;It&apos;s time now to sing out, Tho&apos; the story never ends Let&apos;s celebrate Remember a year in the life of friends Remember the love! Remember the love! Seasons of love!&quot;\n\nIn closing, you&apos;ll laugh, cry, cheer, sing, laugh and if you haven&apos;t done all of these, see it again because you missed something. This is definitely a rock opera of an era we will be talking about for a long time to come.",

I like Rob Schneider and David Spade. I have liked many of the Adam Sandler movies also. This movie is from the same production companies of Sandlers movies. And I must say it is better than most of their recent offerings. I laughed out loud about 10 times and laughed silently many more times. Laughing out loud is something I generally don&apos;t do.\n\nMy review is mostly for those of you that have liked some of the Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, or David Spade movies. I think this movie was better than Anger Management, Mr Deeds, The Longest Yard, The Animal among others. It was very funny at times and it was cute also.\n\nRob Schneider was the man of the group. He played it is the athlete in the group and the leader of the team of misfits. David Spade played a nerd in David Spade style. And Jon Heder was good as a Napolean Dynamite guy with a little more energy.\n\nSure this movie has it&apos;s flows especially in the storyline. Like if Rob Schneider is so much better than Heder or Spade why did the other teams not just walk him.....things like that. But take this movie as it is.....it is better than most Happy Madison productions of late. Schneider, Spade, and Heder fans don&apos;t ignore this movie because of comments by people who don&apos;t like them to begin with.",

And she did in fact win the Oscar for Best Actress.\n\nWho has never seen &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;? What would that movie be without Judy Garland as Dorothy? The early but difficult stages of a very significant career.\n\nIn this new biopic Renée Zellweger gives one of her better performances as Judy Garland, and her singing is very appropriate. She won the Golden Globe for Best Actress. While biopics don&apos;t have lots of latitude, if they follow the factual life of the subject, they can be done dryly or they can be done with a spark. This one has that spark.\n\nOne spark I really enjoyed was when a couple of men, fans, encountered her after a London performance, just the three of them in the alley. She innocently asks if they want to go get food with her, they all end up in the apartment cooking eggs. That was Judy, off stage just another human willing to connect with ordinary people.\n\nThis movie is a very worthwhile look at the life of Judy Garland, focusing both on her early years and mostly on her last year when she died in 1969 at the age of 47. See it for Judy, or see it for Renee, or see it for both. It is a memorable movie of a memorable singer."

And seeing that he is not only the star but also the director and producer of this, makes it even worst.\n\nSurprisingly enough this is a movie worth seeing. I&apos;m with the professionals critics (Entertainment Weekly, Chicago Sun-Times) who gave it 3.5/4 stars or A- . I wasn&apos;t too hasty to hate it, and believe me, by the end of it, the chances are that you might actually like it.\n\nThe star of this is an anti-hero. A man who lacks the conventional heroic attributes. This movie isn&apos;t about idealism, or courage or morality. Basically it&apos;s a movie about bitterness.\n\nThe main protagonist has his own reasons to be bitter and a cynic. In a way the whole movie is his little revenge. But in his little voyage to that dark destination, he does find the good in his heart, plus an unlikely friend.\n\nAlthough it starts like a comedy (and with some crude humor), the movie builds in emotions especially towards the end.\n\nOverall: Check-it out."

The film's low budget and production constraints are often cited as major factors contributing to its shortcomings, though a few find merit in certain scenes and the concept.",

      "reviewBody": "In this 4th and final Chritopher Reeve Superman film, Superman tries to rid the world of nuclear weapons, only to find that Lex Luthor is back and ready to supply the world with these dangerous weapons. Oh, and he has a new sidekick: Nuclear Man! \n\nMany people have given this a lower rating (understandably), but a 3 or 4 out of 10? It really is not that bad. The film is fun, fast-paced and very watchable. Some consider it the worst, but I did not find it any better or worse than part 3. Granted, parts 1 and 2 are superior (thanks Richard Donner) but I&apos;ve seen many worse films than Superman 4.\n\nRandom thoughts: The double date scene was clever, but really annoying and completely pointless. If Superman would just reveal himself to Lois Lane he wouldn&apos;t have to find other girls on the side... although see below.\n\nThe idea of getting rid of nuclear weapons was very nice and a great social and political commentary. I agree getting rid of nuclear weapons would be a good move. But the film made this very unrealistic. The world cheers him on, when in reality the countries would protest. He invades a variety of countries and steals their to secret hidden weapons (not sure on the legality or logistics of that). And what is to stop someone from building these weapons all over again? \n\nWhat happened to Lana Lang? At the end of part 3, it looked like Superman finally realized that Lois Lane is a loser and hooked up with Lana. But she is never seen or mentioned in part 4, despite working for the Daily Planet (at least as of the last film). What gives? \n\nDoes anyone else think Lex Luthor is getting a little tired? Did we really need 3 films with Luthor and one with a Luthor knockoff? What about Brainiac or Bizarro or the Eradicator or just about anyone else? Heck, General Zod is so much cooler than Luthor (with all due respect to Gene Hackman).\n\nThere&apos;s a scene where he rebuilds the great wall of China just by looking at it. What power did he use? Tractor beams from his nipples?\n\nBut anyway, this film is not as bad as many would have you believe, and if you&apos;ve spent six hours on the first three, you might as well invest 90 more minutes in this series finale.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen parts 1 and 2 and applauded this take on a new horror character to stand up with Freddy Kruger. The dark humor and crazy creative kills continue in part 3, but at times I felt that Art was mimicking himself and was too self aware and appreciative, rather than organically funny. (Like in the sun glasses scene in part 2).\n\nThe female companion to Art was interesting but I grew tired of her and she seemed to interfere with Art at times.\n\nThe special effects gore is off the chart and surprisingly realistic. I see part 3 as a worthy effort to explore some other avenues, but risks sending the overall concept on a detour that could easily end the series. I enjoyed parts 1 and 2 more. The last scene which lays some foundation for #4 looks like a good start. The producers have a goose that has laid some golden eggs, they need to be careful not to kill it.",

I started watching this expecting a false move any second now. .....A-any minute.....\n\nBut no. In fact, the beautiful acting was the first thing that took me by surprise. Everyone did a tremendous job..especially the character of Agnes...but everyone did great.\n\nThe second thing I noticed was the direction, which moved perfectly at all the right times. As someone mentioned, &quot;directed with love&quot;, this certainly was...the characters set the pace and the tone...the camerawork let them do that.\n\nThe final thing.....the language. How glad I was that I got to hear those heartfelt Swedish sounds, spoken so earnestly, yet so carefully, like Nutella on toast! (Is that Swedish OK, well you get the idea, no? =)\n\nI&apos;d recommend this film to anyone...but even if you&apos;re like me, with a bit of ADD who likes to hide from anything &quot;artsy&quot;, you will be pleasantly surprised!"

Little does he know that he&apos;s going into a road trip from hell...\n\nRutger Hauer give what I think is his best performance. Sure, there was that menacing Replicant in Blade Runner, but this one overshoots it by a long shot. He delivers a performance so good, that you&apos;ll find it difficult to question whether his character is believable or unbelievable.\n\nC. Thomas Howell, one one of the kids in Steven Spielberg&apos;s ET, plays the protagonist. Here, he faces every driver&apos;s worst nightmare imaginable, and he delivers it with realism. Howell also demonstrates how an ordinary teenager can change into a helpless being who is caught between a psychopathic game of cat-and-mouse set by a brutal man hell-bent on killing him.\n\nThe nice New Mexico cinematography of which the film was filmed and set gives tranquility to the picture and makes the film looks good while delivering the thrills. Strongly supporting this topic is composer Mark Isham&apos;s gritty yet beautiful score. It;s just perfect for this kind of movie.\n\nThe action sequences are handled very nicely here. We got a petrol station blowing up, an intense police car chase, and one of the greatest endings in cinematic history. Period.\n\nThe Hitcher (1986) is one of the first films I have ever watched, and I still cherish it to this day. The 2007 remake, or rather, reDO, is a shallow and uninspiring music-videoish piece of crud that will only be liked by the MTV generation, but never the fans of the original. Why was it remade, we will never know.\n\nOverall, it is an excellent movie and one of the best thrillers ever made. Pick this one up, guys, it&apos;s worth it.\n\n8/10",

Now, Michael Douglas takes the GG persona and morphs it into a Secret Service agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works! This is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing. The detail work in showing the security precautions taken by the SS on behalf of the President and First Lady was likewise intriguing. All the leads were pretty good but, try as I might, I could not accept Eva Longoria as a Secret Service agent. Whereas Jodie Foster just made you suspend belief and really think she was FBI agent Starling in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, you do not get the same feeling with Longoria. Nevertheless, this is a fun film, escapist entertainment with the Beltway as the backdrop.",

It is a very honest and emotional movie with personal clips that show her rise to fame and her feelings about it. One of the biggest reasons why I loved it was because all the different sides of her life were presented in the movie. I loved how all the opposing sides agreed to come together and make this amazing movie. Her parents, managers, ex husband were all included, even though they probably hate one another in real life. I also liked how they included full songs in the documentary. I was a big fan of Amy Winehouse before but this movie made me appreciate her personality and clever poetry. Highly recommended. trust.",

And I gotta say, after seeing this movie, I&apos;m really looking forward to the Brett Ratner version, and that&apos;s saying something. \n\nWhere do I begin? The acting is hilariously awful (Kellan Lutz and the villains especially). The romance is laughable. The fight scenes are a total rip off of 300 and Gladiator, with obnoxious slow-mo being used every 10 seconds. And for a movie with a budget of $70 million, it looks cheap.\n\nThe Legend of Hercules has some of the worst production values I&apos;ve ever seen in a film. The costumes look noticeably cheap, The props are low rent, The green screen effects are amateurish. The 3D conversion is even worse. And the CGI looks worse than an Asylum movie.\n\nFinal Verdict: Unless you&apos;re watching for a cheap laugh, you should avoid this stinker like the plague.",

Karisma Kapoor&apos;s outfits tell a story of their own - makes you wonder if the stylist deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier (at one point she looks like she&apos;s wearing a nappy). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end. There is not one dull moment, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves will have you in stitches of laughter. I especially loved the scene in which Amar (Amir Khan) &apos;regains his memory&apos;. I&apos;ve seen this movie so many times I&apos;ve lost count. And I&apos;m so glad to say that this time Bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as I know A.A.A it is not a replicate of a Hollywood movie (THANK GOD). Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who understands Hindi/ Urdu and loves good comedy.\n\nWatch it you&apos;ll love it!!!!!",

The director must have realised that this was a bad move half way through making the movie so he added a few more of these unmemorable villains to make up for the fact he didn&apos;t have a big impressive killer robot in it and failed miserably.\n\nSorry but that sums it all up for me. There is of course a load of other faults that i won&apos;t go in to but that was the main fault when i watched it.\n\nA few little cool bits in this movie but the bad far outweighs the good.

It is one of my personal favorite movies. Hard Boiled (1992) is literally John Woo&apos;s best Hong Kong action film ever made of all time! The movie is a hard-core action, I have ever seen. It is actually the best Hong Kong action film for me. It belongs right up there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) the best action classic film of all time. Chow Yun-Fat, toothpick in mouth, a gun in each hand. That&apos;s all of the plot you need to know. In fact, this is THE best pure action epic ever filmed. This is my film, my personal favorite Hong Kong action film of all time.\n\n&quot;Give the guy a gun and he&apos;s superman, give him two and he&apos;s God.&quot;\n\nNot even Jackie Chan can mess with this film or beat it. The only Jackie Chan film that is close to this film is Police Story. In my opinion Hard Boiled is John Woo&apos;s best HK action movie from the 90&apos;s and a true masterpiece along with Hard Target (1993) his first American movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme in the main role. \n\nChow Yun-Fat stars as Tequila, a cop hell-bent on bringing down the gun smugglers responsible for his partner&apos;s death. He teams up with an undercover cop Tony Leung whose secret identity as a Triad hit man hangs on thread.\n\nHard Boiled is my favorite John Woo&apos;s HK action movies. This action movie with twists around, The Hong Kong Cinema Hard Boiled has everything in it, no CGI, the stunts are real, the explosions are bigger and the plot of the film is amazing you can get in to the story without guessing what is going to happened and what the plot is about. The warehouse scenes and a shooting a motorcycles in an explosions from Tequila is my favorite scenes in the movie. Sometimes to me it come for this movie is similar to Miami Vice when Tony Leung was undercover cop on a boat he remind me on Sonny Crockett, but the shout outs in this film are awesome. Just Miami Vice TV series where more about drug cartels, this is arms dealer weapons about triads. \n\nThe stunts are real and very dangerous. There was a hospital siege which was actually Die Hard in a hospital. Hard Boiled is a classic action film from Hong Kong, they don&apos;t make movies like this anymore. Phillip Chan is also in this film which I forgot to mention in my review Philip Chan was also in Van Damme&apos;s Bloodsport. You have a great action sequences in the tea house, where the guns are hitting in the bird cage, he shoots a dozen guys and saves a baby, the hospital sequences are real. The first time I saw this film I had no idea that how great film it is, the greatest movie of all time in the cinema. John Woo is also as a bartender in this film. The hospital sequences for me is real, the action is real. The best Chow Yun-Fat and John Woo movie ever made. \n\nHard Boiled is a 1992 Hong Kong action film written by Barry Wong and directed by John Woo. It stars Chow Yun-fat as Inspector &quot;Tequila&quot; Yuen, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai\n\n10/10 I love this movie to death it is my favorite Hong Kong Action film and it is my second favorite film that I love. It is also my number 2 favorite action film.",

Blessed, I thank God for entering that word choice, with a marvellous score. Answers and question marks make for a captivating rendezvous. And importantly, as the crucial essence of the genre, this from start to finish. Borrowings from European cinema yes, nunploitation no. Well, a little, but primarily 70s horror. And the contrast between light and dark is a deliberate stylistic device - after all, this is Cecilia&apos;s destiny. Just like the harsh impact of violent peaks in the bittersweet basic tone. And at the end of the escalating ordeal, the viewer possibly gains an essential realisation: the suffering of Mary. Thank you, emancipation can be so unobtrusive after all.",

      "reviewBody": "Icarus, much like its mythological namesake, starts out openly enough. Writer/director Bryan Fogel, obviously undergoing a mid-life crisis, seeks to rise above his competition and win an long-eluded amateur bike race by subscribing to a doping program ala Lance Armstrong and Tyler Hamilton. His gonzo-ish film about cheating the system then takes a serious turn as he flies extremely close to the sun by becoming involved with Russian doping superstar, Grigory Rodchenkov, just prior to the 2016 summer Olympics and Russian scandal – the doping scandal that is, taking into consideration another very serious scandal that occurred in the United States later that year in November, an event this film alludes to. \n\nFogel&apos;s film presents a complete analysis of Russia&apos;s athletic doping program and its pervasive influence on all of its athletes while providing a revealing look at how the conspiracy came to light leading to the eventual banning of 68 Russian athletes from Rio. The documentary is so compelling you cannot look away. \n\nRodchenkov, who comes across as a favorite crazy uncle, blasts away on camera with truths and proofs that lead to WADA and the IOC&apos;s landmark decision. Rodchenkov equally has no problems with broadcasting his opinions concerning President Vladimir Putin&apos;s fear-laden regime. If Putin and the KGB can easily evade the IOC, imagine what other high-level larceny exists that can be used to, ahem, trump other standards. \n\nIcarus presents art dictating life, where one rather flaky story uncovers a very-real conspiracy that affects so many. This is not merely a sports documentary, rather a politically human one with real consequences, and needs to be viewed. Here&apos;s hoping the Academy&apos;s nomination committee is taking note, as Icarus has the potential to win gold of its own.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a pretty good drama with an excellent cast of characters.  The story centers around Michael Douglas, who plays a division head in a high tech company in Seattle that is undergoing a merger.  Demi Moore plays his old girlfriend, an aggressive corporate executive, who comes in and snatches away the job promotion he was counting on, then failing to seduce him after hours, files a false sexual harassment with the company in order to get rid of him.\n\nIt&apos;s interesting that although the story revolves around Michael Douglas&apos;s plight, it&apos;s the women who set the events in motion and who help the protagonist resolve the problem he&apos;s presented with.  Female empowerment is the main theme of this movie.\n\nDemi Moore gets perhaps her best movie role ever by playing the sexual predator to Michael Douglas&apos;s easygoing mid-level manager.  She knows how to play the corporate game much better than him, and quickly boxes him into a dicey situation.  How does a guy explain that it was his female boss who hit on him and not the other way around as she claims?   Demi Moore controls the situation well for most of the movie, and plays the villain so well that the viewer really enjoys when she finally gets her comeuppance.\n\nRoma Maffia does an excellent job of playing Michael Douglas&apos;s lawyer.  He&apos;s lost on how to respond to the sexual harassment charges and what to do to preserve his job, and she forcefully takes over his defense and steers him towards a successful resolution.  She also understands how the game is played and keeps her nerve when the company comes after her client. \n\n Caroline Goodall plays Michael Douglas&apos;s wife and displays a perfect combination of anger and support while he resolves the charges against him. A lawyer herself, she understands the situation her husband has gotten into much better than he does, and is there for him as both an advisor and partner.  \n\nRosemary Forsyth plays another female executive at the company who, without giving away the plot, mentors Michael Douglas through his dilemma.  She&apos;s smart, but calm and principled, and in fact it is she, not Douglas, who eventually gets the promotion to head the company.\n\n Even though Michael Douglas is the protagonist and eventually overcomes the crisis he&apos;s facing, his character is basically weak in the movie.  He&apos;s carefree and unfocused at the outset, assuming the job promotion is his because he&apos;s done a good job for the company, and is completely blindsided when a woman takes it away from him and then threatens his career and his marriage.  Douglas eventually takes charge and with alot of outside help and some improbable plot twists gets the upper hand, but in the cutthroat world of corporate intrigue, he&apos;s the little fish who gets lucky and swims out of the net.\n\nDonald Sutherland hands in his usual fine performance as the president of the company.  Dennis Miller plays a computer geek working for Michael Douglas and has a few humorous moments, but suddenly turns nasty in the middle of the movie and then just disappears.  Dylan Baker plays a sort of Mr. Smithers kind of character to Donald Sutherland&apos;s Monty Burns, and is just egregious enough make you hate him, which is a good sign of a performance well done.\n\nThere are a few plot twists that offend the viewer&apos;s senses and things are wrapped up just a bit too neatly, but all in all, this is pretty good entertainment from start to finish.  The movie touches an important issues, sexual harassment in the workplace, and makes it more interesting by making the woman the aggressor and the man the victim.  Not surprisingly, I noticed that women gave this movie a higher average rating than did the men.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;TAKE ME HOME TONIGHT&apos;: Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nThis 80&apos;s movie homage actually is just that: a tribute to the youth films of the 80&apos;s and it does a pretty good job. It actually feels like a film from that decade (like something John Hughes might have produced) and not just a send-up or satire of it (like the advertisements sort of implied). Topher Grace stars in the film as well as executive produced and co-wrote it (with Gordon Kaywin and Jackie and Jeff Filgo). Michael Dowse (who also directed the popular &apos;headbanger&apos; film &apos;FUBAR&apos; and it&apos;s sequel) directed. Teresa Palmer, Dan Fogler, Anna Faris, Chris Pratt and Michael Biehn (one of my all time favorite actors) co-star in the flick.\n\nThe film is set in the summer of 1988 after Matt Franklin (Grace) just graduated from MIT. Instead of pursuing a high paying career like his education entitles him to he takes a part time job as a video store clerk at the local Suncoast Video store in the mall, much to the disappointment of his father Bill (Biehn) who&apos;s also a local police officer. Matt is scared and completely unsure of what he wants to do with his life, all until his old high school crush, Tori Fredreking (Palmer), comes back into town and into the store where he works. Matt lies to Tori and tells her he works for Goldman Sachs. Tori is impressed and invites him to a Labor Day party hosted by his twin sister Wendy&apos;s (Faris) boyfriend Kyle Masterson (Pratt). Matt goes to the party with Wendy and his best friend Barry (Fogler) and all hell breaks loose when Barry steals a car from the dealership he was fired from the same day. \n\nThe movie really does have a classic 80&apos;s nostalgic feel to it and like I said it feels like a movie out of that time period rather than just a comedic reference to it. The script is somewhat smart and emotional and the characters are really well developed. Topher Grace is very fitting as the film&apos;s lead, Palmer looks beautiful and is equally fitting and Fogler is actually good for a change (he&apos;s still not really that funny but he gives a decent performance). Faris isn&apos;t bad as well and Pratt and Biehn (who&apos;s the perfect 80&apos;s icon touch, with nerds) give nice supporting performances. The soundtrack adds a nice touch as well. The film does a good job of pulling off a classic 80&apos;s throwback feel and definitely accomplishes what it set out to do. If it had actually came out in that decade though it probably wouldn&apos;t have been much of a standout but it could have been a mildly loved looked over gem (much like it is now).\n\nWatch our movie review show &apos;MOVIE TALK&apos; at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg96qKy2R0",

      "reviewBody": "If one were to place too great an emphasis on many of the smug and self-serving views expressed by various contributors here, it may well appear somewhat of an enigma that HART&apos;S WAR still rates 6.3 overall. Obviously many who have voted have not posted a review. Equally obviously, to offset its many detractors...a significant number of people must have liked it. I&apos;m one of them! \n\nLet us agree immediately, anyone looking for a sequel to THE GUNS OF NAVARONE can expect to be disappointed. A screen adaptation of John Katzenbach&apos;s excellent novel, this late WW2 flick tackles racism, POW life and honor...and not necessarily in that order. A re-hash of the plot is unnecessary as every second reviewer has covered this aspect. It is a film to LISTEN to and to take from it what you are able. Negative comments such that the events portrayed are &quot;unlikely,&quot; that Bruce Willis isn&apos;t the &quot;star,&quot; that &quot;nothing happens except lots of people keep talking,&quot; are a sad indictment of viewers with a limited attention span. A lot of what is uttered during the &quot;court-room&quot; sequences has great relevance in all facets of life - IF you care to listen. Farrell is excellent as is Willis in what admittedly IS a far smaller role. Willis&apos; presence however is felt throughout the movie in much the same way as was Jack Nicholson&apos;s in A FEW GOOD MEN. (Another military court room flick)\n\nYes its longish and it would be fair to say it is extremely dark for the greater part of the film. It is ultimately though a worthwhile addition to other POW films. You could do a lot worse."

Great acting on behalf of Meryl Streep which of course is not surprising. I was missing the role of central banks in this strange but true world order and of course the new role of crypto currencies that have become a new outlet for tax evasion and miscellaneous corruption.\n\nProbably one of the reason it is still flourishing.\n\nIt is probably impossible to cover all aspects in one film.\n\nI am truly surprised about the low rating it has gotten from users.\n\nMy only explanation is that it does not follow the centuries old blueprint of the heroes journey moving along a standard three act structure, which I consider daring and a plus. Especially if it manages to advance the art of film making, which this film does.\n\nDirectorial gimmicks of intertwining realms in one take usually used in the world of expensive and glossy corporate videos make this film a gem."

      "reviewBody": "L.A. cops Charlie and Hank respond to what they believe is a false alarm. It is not, but they went to check out the situation just in case. Charlie is killed.\n\nEarl wants to be an L.A. cop but his outrageous and reckless behavior gets him kicked out of the academy. Never mind that Earl can do no wrong because any criticism from whites is the result of racism against black people.\n\nHank is bitter about losing his partner, so it doesn&apos;t help matters that he is the one who catches Earl trying to break into his own car. And Earl is allergic to bees so when a bee complicates the situation and Hank tries to swat the bee, and Earl is mostly behind the car so the person videotaping the scene can&apos;t really tell what&apos;s going on ...\n\nIt&apos;s Rodney King all over again. And the joke of a trial gets Hank sent up the river.\n\nSix months later, Earl and Hank work for the same security company. Hank ends up at the Coca-Cola warehouse where Earl works because, while the guys who got Charlie killed are up to no good, Earl is making out with the secretary.\n\nThe result: a whole lot of wasted soda.\n\nEarl and Hank now have to learn to work together so they can catch the guys responsible for Charlie&apos;s death. Never mind that they are not real cops. The results are hilarious and fun. There is even an exciting car chase which results in the pursuing cop cars turning upside down.\n\nThis is just a fun movie with some explosions, crashes and other excitement and plenty of laughs. Don&apos;t look for outstanding acting or writing, but to me Martin Lawrence is quite appealing despite his constant racist attitude. Toward the end, this is actually pretty good as the guys work toward solving the mystery.\n\nOne actor stands out: Cleo King is a black woman who picks up the guys when they need a ride. And she won&apos;t take any attitude, though she is really a nice person. She&apos;s not around long.\n\nMartin Lawrence&apos;s stunt man (or men) does an impressive job. It&apos;s scary what they let him do.\n\nDon&apos;t expect too much, and you won&apos;t be disappointed."

There is a lot of dramatic tension, but it seems like the script was dumbed down for the Hollywood mass market. Totally understand the rationale of the approach, but I think that, as a result, the movie fell short of being compelling.\n\nWhen the English do this kind of movie, or the Europeans, what you get is dark tragic theatre. When the Americans try to do it, I think that they end up doing too much test marketing and as a result the movie suffers.\n\nWith the really serious depth of talent in the cast, you would have to think that there was much more that could have been put on the screen (and may have been on the cutting room floor for all I know).\n\nThere is one redeeming feature though. This movie does reveal a darkness, and offers a comment on the culture of today, of capitalism, of markets, of law etc... It doesn&apos;t pull any punches in that regard and that is a really good thing!",

      "reviewBody": "Woody Allen keeps showing why he is one of the best things to ever happen to cinema. Why we need him so much. without Allen, the cinema industry would have been a little boring. His films are unique and very powerful by meaning of beauty, art and emotion. &quot;A Rainy Day in New York&quot; is another perfect example of true art. The film stars with a young couple visiting New York for the weekend and end up in a rainy day full of excitements. The movie feels like another Allen love story from the start: the location of New York, the narrating, the differences between characters, how they fall in love against all chances, and the sweet ending that all viewers wish to have in their lives. When I first saw this film I immediately had a sense of nostalgia towards &quot;Manhattan&quot; and &quot;Annie Hall&quot;. All films perfectly connect to each other, not by plot but more in a sense of genre and dialogue. The dialogues in this film are just like in any other of Allen&apos;s films, catchy, humorous and with a lot of sense towards life. The cast is amazing: Timothèe Chalamet is wonderful, his character resembles a lot of Allen&apos;s performance in his other films. Basically it&apos;s the same character but different actor. Selena Gomez is adorable and shines in her role, Elle Fanning is humorous, the entire cast works so well with the genre of the film. Overall I am in love with this film, I enjoyed it so much and I recommend it to everyone, I think this is my new favorite Allen movie.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie is very funny, I had many laughs at the more dim of the two (the stereotypical dumb blonde) Michele. What&apos;s nice about the film is the way it accentuates what true friendship really means, standing by one another. The two went from being the fat girl (Romy) &amp; the girl with the back brace (Michele) to being two attractive fun-loving women. The lesson the pair learn is to be yourself &amp; be proud of who you are. Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino are perfectly cast in this film, as are all of the other characters (including extras - which is unusual). As well as a great script though, this film also has great music. If you like 80&apos;s music then this film is for you, as it features throughout the entire film.\n\nYes, it was over the top. Yes, it was predictable. But Janeane Garofalo&apos;s performance made this movie worth buying. I loved how Romy and Michele seemed to be completely oblivious to their own personal lack of accomplishments. The fashion/costume design is delightfully tacky, and there&apos;s a sweet message at the end. I also think this was Lisa Kudrow&apos;s best performance in all the movies she&apos;s ever done and was even more impressive than her ditsy Phoebe Buffay character on &quot;FRIENDS&quot;. The film is not meant to be very serious, so don&apos;t expect a script that reflects with 100% accuracy the daily lives of people. This is meant to be as a funny story of two people to entertain the viewer and I believe it&apos;s quite successful in doing that. Get some snacks, get your favorite drink and start watching to see who invented Post-Its!\n\nOverall rating: 7 out of 10.",

Undeterred by her scene-causing out-of-control ramifications, Gwen staggers to the newlyweds&apos; limo and careens along a suburban area looking for a `cake shop&apos; to replace the damaged goods only to have her smash the car into a nearby house.\n\nFlash forward to her being sentenced to Serenity Glen, a rehabilitation clinic, the type that offers New Age-y touchie-feely bonding and chanting (`Together! Together! NOOOO Drugs!&apos;) and a no-nonsense counselor named Cornell (Buscemi in a nicely handled understated turn) who sees right through Gwen&apos;s anger and stubbornness as she attempts to disassociate herself from her chores, group therapy and sneaking pills in via Jasper.  After a mishap involving Gwen falling from her window (after a weak attempt to rid herself from the pills), she limpingly begs Cornell for a chance to redeem herself.  Her sarcasm slowly drifts away as she comes to grips with her co-dependency on booze and pharmaceuticals thanks largely to her depressed teenage roomie Andrea (Skye) and new patient, Eddie Boone (Mortensen), a baseball pitcher overcoming many addictions including casual sex.\n\nThe film works solely on the fresh-scrubbed sexy appeal of Bullock in her range from comic drunkeness (a la `Arthur&apos;) to her scary withdrawl and gumption to change her life for the better.  The humor comes thankfully to her fellow in-house patients including a gay German dancer (Tudyk who comes across as Andy Dick in `Sprockets&apos;) and the parody of a soap opera (`Santa Cruz&apos;) that the entire group becomes.well addicted to.   It&apos;s hard to believe that the subject of a chemically dependent person could be funny, but that isn&apos;t the point.  The point is that it doesn&apos;t make light of the situation at all (including the all-too-forseeable overdose of one of the characters to underscore just how serious it is), but it succeeds on the `patients-running-the-asylum&apos; scenario - sort of a cross-blend of `One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&apos;,  `Clean and Sober&apos; and `M*A*S*H&apos; with its hysterically, deadpanned homage of loudspeaker announcements.\n\nDirector Betty Thomas (`The Brady Bunch Movie&apos;, `Private Parts&apos;) serves her story by Susannah Grant (`Erin Brockovich&apos;) as best she can with interesting camera angles to distort the hyperreality of someone under the influence and able support including stand-up comic O&apos;Malley (late of his short-lived eponymous sitcom) who harbors a not-so-secret crush on Bullock. Bullock does herself a service by starring in a tricky scenario by utilizing her natural acting style and stretching her chops both dramatically and comically."

      "reviewBody": "U-Turn is about a man named Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn) who is on his way to pay a debt to a gangster when his car breaks down in the small, redneck town of Superior. There, Bobby is taken advantage of by the good IL&apos; boys in every way possible, from the dirty mechanic to the town sheriff. He meets a beautiful girl named Grace (Jennifer Lopez) and falls for her, and she seemingly falls for him as well. From here, there are twists and turns in the plot all the way to the very end of the movie.\n\nSean Penn was decent as Bobby, but seemed a bit week and was taken advantage of a bit too easily. I guess that was Bobby&apos;s character so he did a good job. Jennifer Lopez did not have as big a part as I thought, but she did OK with it. Nothing spectacular, just OK.\n\nThe characters that stole the movie, in my honest opinion, were Darrell the mechanic (Billy Bob Thornton) and Toby N. Tucker (Joaquin Phoenix). They had the redneck stereotypes down pat, especially Thornton.\n\nThis movie was a decent little thriller. I am glad I did not see it way back when it was in theaters but it is OK for a rental. I give 7 of 10 stars.",

I saw many reviews with comments such as this didn&apos;t deserve its Oscar win and that this movie was far from a masterpiece because it was too sentimental and exaggerated.One person proposed showing less scenes of him with the cello, speeding up the movie, and cutting out scenes with long stares. I disagree and believe that this movie is beautiful the way it is. This movie is not overbrimming with sentimentality; it has a good amount for such an emotional film. The scenes with the cello and the birds represent the passion and emotions he feel. We don&apos;t call Shakespeare&apos;s long poems sentimental so why do we call this work of Japanese art that? The more I heard the music I felt like the more I understood the movie. Western movies sometimes disregard time in movies allowing action to follow action. This movie was simply about the meaning of living knowing that we would die. The long, drawn out silences were necessary to convey emotions. If you have studied many Asian cultures, you know that they convey emotions not through words but through silence. The silences give us time to ponder and think about the questions raised, something we are often not given in bang bang action American films.As a musician, I feel like this whole movie is like song filled with much raw emotion.",

      "reviewBody": "One of my dreams is to visit Guersnay and the other islands that the Brits call the Channel Islands. I am fascinated by the history, landscapes and stories of those who visited them. Now another reason has been added - watching the 2018 film &apos;The Guernsay Literary and Potato Pie Society&apos; by Mike Newall. The director of the ultimate British film in the genre of &apos;good feeling&apos; (I mean, of course, &apos;Four Weddings and a Funeral&apos;) manages to turn a war drama combined with a story about the power of the written word and reading into another film that belongs to this genre in which he is an expert. The result is one of those films that separates the opinions of critics from those of the majority of the public. This time my opinions go hand in hand with those of the general public. &apos;Guernsay&apos; (allow me to abbreviate the name) is a movie that I liked, I was interested in, I was excited about, I felt good after viewing it. That was the goal, wasn&apos;t it?\n\nWe are dealing with two stories. The outer one has as its heroine Juliet Ashton, a London journalist and writer, who entertains with a group of Guernsey residents during World War II a correspondence related to their passion for reading. The emotional and intriguing story of the group of simple people who find moral support in their love of books in the only English territory under German occupation causes her to travel after the war to the British island, located much closer to the continent than England, to meet them personally. She will find not only a group of people who survived the hard times of the war in various ways, but also a mystery about the disappearance of one of the members of the club. Gradually a story of heroism and betrayal, impossible love and social prejudice is revealed to her. In addition, her existence will be disturbed, including her love life.\n\nCritics of the film blame it for clichés in the plot (almost everything that happens is predictable) and for creating the image of an idealized nice and sweet England that did not exist and does not exist in reality. Even if I accept these flaws, they seem minor to me compared to the charm of each scene, the emotional intensity of the story, the depth and psychological diversity of the characters. Of course, much of the deep impression that this film made to me is due to the impression the performances of the actors made on me. I should list them all, but I&apos;ll just name Lily James, in the lead role, a character one can&apos;t help but fall in love with, and Tom Courtney, the rebellious young man from the &apos;kitchen sink&apos; movies, the British equivalent and contemporary of the French New Wave, now at the age of great roles that conclude an impressive career. &apos;Guernsay&apos; is a film that I recommend to all those who believe in the power of books, who love historical films and romantic stories, and who love England. In fact, is anybody else left out? Maybe just a few movie critics.",

      "reviewBody": "If there were ever a film that sums up the phrase &apos;mixed bag&apos;, then Mudbound is surely it. Ranging from emotionally devastating and harrowing drama to downright tedious periods of nothingness, this is one of the most inconsistent films you&apos;ll ever see, and although its highest points prove utterly enthralling and truly memorable, its lowest offer next to nothing in terms of riveting drama. Its performances are strong and its directing confident, but that doesn&apos;t escape the fact that this film is just a real mixed bag.\n\nLet&apos;s start with the film&apos;s opening act, which is one of the most boring and frustrating hours I&apos;ve spent watching a film. Starting off with a confusing and poorly executed opening scene, the film really fails to pick itself up over the course of its whole first hour, doing little more than to establish some of the main characters and the hardships of the muddy, isolated rural community, things that could have surely been done just as effectively in a good ten minutes.\n\nFor the duration of the whole first act, it&apos;s pretty difficult to tell what the end game of the movie actually is. For one, you&apos;ve got the story of a young woman whose marriage allowed her to escape her dull family, and who also is deeply frustrated with the muddiness and poverty-stricken nature of her current life. Then there&apos;s some detailing of the horrific levels of racism in 1940s Mississippi, with the family&apos;s grandfather being the main example for some nasty remarks throughout. There&apos;s also a young black man who goes off to war, who we occasionally check in with during his battles in Europe, while we also see the brother of the central white family flying in the Air Force during the war.\n\nAs you can tell by that very bungled description, the film&apos;s first act is an absolute mess. There&apos;s very little way to tell what the main story is, and what you should really be focusing on for the biggest emotional intrigue, and that, coupled with the fact that it moves at a deathly slow pace, makes it a very frustrating and extremely tedious first hour.\n\nHowever, things really do pick up come the second act. Upon seeing the two men return to Mississippi from the war, the film&apos;s central focus finally comes to the forefront, and we immediately get a very tense exchange between the racist grandfather and the African-American war veteran. That&apos;s undoubtedly one of the film&apos;s highest points, and sets up the atmosphere of deep racial tensions well, finally giving the film at least a continuing and consistent tension under the surface, something that was completely absent from its first act.\n\nThe second act then goes into looking at how different generations respond to the institutionalised racism, while also shedding light on how horrifically unjust some of the hardships suffered by so many hard-working African-Americans were at the time, which proves for an interesting, albeit never quite powerful watch. The film&apos;s middle portion is a great insight into the time period, and holds your attention throughout, but it never quite manages to hit you hard enough as a film telling such a story should do.\n\nAnd then comes the film&apos;s final act, which is exceptional. For the final thirty minutes or so, the devastating reality of racism in the past is brought brutally into focus, and it makes for a deeply disturbing and uncomfortable but powerfully moving watch. With the film&apos;s tension at its height, it doesn&apos;t hold back in displaying some truly horrifying scenes, some of which are easily the most intense and powerful I have ever seen in a film dealing with the topic.\n\nThe final act is directed brilliantly, being frank and brutally realistic in its depiction of injustice, and moving along at a slow but tense pace to emphasise some truly horrible acts, all the while maintaining a strong dignity that allows the deeper, emotional side of the sequences to shine through too, all of which makes it simply astonishing to see.\n\nIt&apos;s fair to say then, given the huge range of comments I have for this film, ranging from total boredom to transfixing and hard-hitting emotion, that Mudbound is a very inconsistent mixed bag, however there is one element to it that works well from start to finish: the performances.\n\nThe wide range of characters in the first act does make its story somewhat muddled, but each of the actors really shines in bringing their own character to life. Carey Mulligan is very strong and convincing as a young mother frustrated with her life in poverty, Garrett Hedlund and Jason Mitchell are both charismatic young men, meaning that their relationship really shines when it&apos;s on display, while Jonathan Banks is excellent as the terrifyingly racist old man, bringing a powerful tension into the film every time he walks into a room.\n\nOverall, then, it&apos;s pretty clear that Mudbound isn&apos;t a resoundingly successful movie. At times an interesting insight into racism and injustice in the Deep South in the 40s, at others a tedious slog of randomly muddled drama and characters, and at others an astonishingly powerful, hard-hitting and truly memorable (dare I say it, even Oscar- worthy) drama, it&apos;s a very inconsistent and overall frustrating film. However, with its strong performances all the way through and exceptional drama at points, it is a memorable watch.",

Everything is perfectly over-the-top: the music, the gaudy colors, the makeup--it&apos;s all done to the point where it is totally ridiculous, which is what King and Romero want. And I must admit I did like the segment &quot;The Crate.&quot; How can you NOT love a giant ape-monster running around tearing people to bits? Sick, sick stuff, but enjoyable all the same.\n\nIf you like gruesome black humor, this is the movie for you. &quot;Creepshow&quot; is shock schlock at its very best.

      "name": "A decent adaptation of a problematic novel, which awkwardly tries to find a feminist angle where there isn&apos;t much of one to begin with.",
      "reviewBody": "How do you solve a problem like Bathsheba Everdene? It&apos;s a question that has plagued literary enthusiasts since 1874, when Thomas Hardy first introduced her to the world in one of his classic novels, Far From The Madding Crowd. Today, 141 years later, that same question haunts Thomas Vinterberg&apos;s sumptuous, smart adaptation - one that tries valiantly, but doesn&apos;t wholly succeed, in celebrating the strength of a character that was always somewhat illusory to begin with.\n\nIn a time ruled and defined exclusively by men, Bathsheba Everdene (Carey Mulligan) stands apart as a free-spirited, independent young lass who refuses to bow to convention. When she inherits the farm belonging to her late uncle, she insists on running it herself - working in the fields and sacking the male workers who disrespect her authority. Small wonder, then, that Bathsheba draws the attention of three suitors, each one representing a different social class and a unique brand of manhood: stoic farmer Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts); stern, serious-minded landowner William Boldwood (Michael Sheen); and sexy, emotionally scarred sergeant Francis Troy (Tom Sturridge).\n\nThe main problem with Hardy&apos;s novel, which is largely replicated in Vinterberg&apos;s faithful adaptation, is its awkward attitude towards its lead female character. To be sure, Hardy gives Bathsheba a modern voice that still rings true today: &quot;It is difficult for a woman to define her feelings in a language chiefly made by men to express theirs,&quot; she declares. It&apos;s a line so delicious that screenwriter David Nicholls nicked it wholesale for the film. And yet, on a deeper reading of the novel, it becomes far harder to tell whether Hardy is celebrating Bathsheba&apos;s independence, or punishing her for it.\n\nTo their credit, Vinterberg and Nicholls do try a little harder to add a truly feminist bent to their version of Bathsheba&apos;s story. More care is taken to forge a genuine emotional connection between Bathsheba and Gabriel, even as her seduction of William Boldwood is made less purposeful. Bathsheba still finds herself approaching Sergeant Troy with lust rather than caution, but she does so in a more clear-eyed manner. In effect, Mulligan&apos;s Bathsheba seems bemused at and somewhat resigned to the sillier decisions she makes in her romantic pursuits.\n\nThe trouble is that, while these little changes do add up to a stronger character, they also result in thematic and tonal confusion. The truth of the matter is that Hardy was not always concerned with celebrating Bathsheba as a character in her own right - he was frequently more interested in commenting on the ideal romantic suitor, the kind of man to whom Bathsheba should give her heart. There&apos;s never any doubt, in Hardy&apos;s mind at least, what her choice should be. After a point, then, Vinterberg&apos;s film flounders because there is, truthfully, no real tension in the romantic dilemma that stares Bathsheba in the face.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame, because Vinterberg has brought Hardy&apos;s world to life with a very good cast indeed. Mulligan plays the fire and spirit of Bathsheba well, although she&apos;s trapped as much by the script as her character is by Hardy&apos;s words and ideas in the novel. As the sturdy Gabriel Oak (his surname says it all), Schoenaerts turns a rather dull but handy lump of a man into a semi-credible romantic prospect. The ever-reliable Sheen doesn&apos;t have quite enough screen-time, but nevertheless packs a great deal of depth and despair into the loss of William Boldwood&apos;s heart (and, perhaps, mind) to the charms of Ms. Everdene. There&apos;s almost more to be enjoyed in the semi-confessional scene shared by these two very different men as they sheepishly dance around their feelings for the same woman. Sturridge, meanwhile, is the relatively weaker link in the cast; his performance is fuelled more by his sexy moustache and saucy swordmanship than anything else.\n\nAt a point in time when female-led films are being discussed, dissected and celebrated more than ever before, Far From The Madding Crowd would - at least on the surface - appear to be part of this growing tradition. The filmmakers have certainly tried to create a version of Bathsheba Everdene that&apos;s unequivocally appealing to a modern audience. But it&apos;s an effort that, ultimately, doesn&apos;t quite work, since the point of Hardy&apos;s novel was arguably more about the man Bathsheba should marry, and less about Bathsheba herself.",

In addition, this movie&apos;s scene transition is so bad.. it is like a YouTube video or smth.. not professional and i think we can not categorize that like it is real movie.

      "reviewBody": "With just over a $4 M budget, you would think there&apos;s only so much that a sci-fi/fantasy film can accomplish, but &quot;Night Watch&quot; proves exception with its well-imagined and executed effects courtesy the creative mind of Timur Bekmambetov. The style of the film alone helps to cover up the weak structure of the script.\n\n&quot;Night Watch,&quot; based on the novel by Sergei Lukyanenko, is sort of an anthropomorphic imagining of good versus evil, where good/light and evil/darkness are manifested as special individuals called &quot;Others&quot; who have been at peace since a truce long ago that said all would be able to choose freely between good or evil. Naturally there needs to be means of enforcing this truce, so there&apos;s a Night Watch (good guys) and a Day Watch (bad guys) who make sure both sides play nice. This of course becomes a lot harder with a prophecy suggesting someone will come along and his/her choice will throw off the balance forever. It&apos;s really a classic sci-fi &quot;secret supernatural beings living among humans fighting a war of sorts&quot; premise.\n\nFrom the get-go, this movie is hard to follow. That concept gets presented fairly quickly and the script doesn&apos;t really give us any extra help in understanding who is what. It&apos;s hard to tell who is on what side and why and it hurts the film throughout whether its the lack of connection felt to the characters or that you&apos;re fighting just to get it the whole time that you have trouble appreciating much else.\n\nAlso important to know is that this film is not action-oriented. Although there are fight scenes, these are hardly action sequences as a moviegoer exposed to Western action movies might define them. It&apos;s more of a thriller story with lots of special effects and creative editing to bring the secret world of good vs. evil to life.\n\nBekmambetov is the key to making this movie work. He realizes that with the right editing techniques, anything low budget can still come across effectively. One early shot of the main character Anton taking out a vampire combines a little bit of special effects, illusion and make-up, but it is filmed in quick sequence that makes it all appear simultaneous like it is a CGI effect. It&apos;s creative thinking (and a few slow motion shots too).",

Every generation is passed on the world from their parents and they have to deal with it and the fact that they may even become their parents. This is that story in it&apos;s all it&apos;s angsty 90&apos;s glory and the film does it with some fair humor. Winona Ryder,Ben Stiller, Ethan Hawke, and Steve Zahn are your main players but a number of cameos are made from other 90&apos;s mainstays such as David Spade and Andy Dick. While the movie does risk becoming too campy at times, for the most part this is a dry and fairly sober look at what it meant to be a young adult trying to survive at that time.",

      "reviewBody": "Melissa McCarthy has been making a pretty steady stream of films almost identical to this one, but where &quot;Bridesmaids&quot;, &quot;The Heat,&quot; and even &quot;Identity Thief&quot; succeeded, &quot;Tammy&quot; fell very short. &quot;Tammy&quot; is a movie about a middle-aged woman whose obnoxious personality has finally caught up to her. In the first five minutes of the film she has totaled her car, gotten fired from her job, and discovered her husband is having an affair. Her solution to this is to hit the road with her alcoholic grandmother and what follows is a cringe-worthy look at what happens when fictional crass and drunk people do whatever they want. A great idea right? \n\nWrong. I&apos;ve always liked road-trip movies. I&apos;ve always like road-trips. They bring out people&apos;s true characters, and what they&apos;re actually like when they&apos;ve been alone in a car for a couple of hours. Yes, this can be pretty unpleasant when we&apos;re in the midst of it, but when we&apos;re allowed to sit back and watch, humanity becomes admirable when we can see what people are actually like with no boundaries, because the result is often good. If my opinion is asked for, that should be the goal of most films: to take a look at who we are.\n\nSo yes, I was looking forward to watching &quot;Tammy&quot; solely because of the fact that it&apos;s a road-trip movie. Unfortunately, this is not a road-trip movie. There are maybe three scenes in the entire film that take place in a car, and I&apos;m pretty sure the only time we actually saw anyone driving on a highway was at the very start as Tammy was driving to work. It can be pretty hard to make a cross-country trip if you only drive through neighborhood streets, unless I&apos;m reading the map upside- down.\n\n&quot;Tammy&quot; had an outstanding cast, and it was largely wasted. Starring is of course Melissa McCarthy, playing the exact same character she always plays. That character has been very funny in the past, specifically large-screen debuting in &quot;Bridesmaids&quot;, but here it just felt rehearsed. For what McCarthy called her passion project, I felt like she almost didn&apos;t even want to be there. Susan Sarandon co-stars as the grandmother, whose character must have been a grandmother at age thirty by the looks of it. In the outstanding (on paper) supporting cast we find Allison Janney, Kathy Bates, Sandra Oh, Mark Duplass, Nat Faxon, Sarah Baker, Toni Collette, and Dan Aykroyd. Bates and Baker specifically were very good, but were given way too little time on screen, and I was legitimately surprised Aykroyd and Colette even agreed to do this movie considering what they were given.\n\nDirector, supporting actor, co-writer, and husband to star Melissa McCarthy, Ben Falcone, attempted something different with his directorial debut, and that&apos;s where &quot;Tammy&quot; hurt more than anywhere else. What was advertised was an R-rated comedy, where you sit down to laugh at stupid people doing stupid things, and Falcone embraced that. Where he faulted was also trying to make this movie heartfelt with a good message behind it. What resulted was a 96 minute film where I didn&apos;t care for the characters or laugh a single time. I applaud Falcone for experimenting, but he should have realized that it didn&apos;t work and take advantage of the reshoot that they took to make some much needed changes. \n\nI was very put off by &quot;Tammy&quot;. I&apos;m not a very big fan of the R- rated comedy genre in the first place, but I still laugh as the filmmakers blatantly attempt to elicit that reaction. Unfortunately, &quot;Tammy&quot; was not funny, and that can be a problem when that&apos;s the only reason somebody will go see this movie. So as I walked out of the theater I finally laughed as some bloopers began to play and my friend aptly stated: &quot;Let&apos;s go. No need to watch the mistakes of the mistake.&quot;\n\nI give &quot;Tammy&quot; a 5.2/10.",

I watch this for the second time, but still fall for Bunny and Naina. The songs are also beautiful and enjoyable for me. This is the best romance movie of Ranbir Kapoor. Cannot stand seeing the way Bunny look at Naina after a long time haven&apos;t meet. His gaze really deacribed his feelings toward Naina. Although this is romance movie, but they success telling and desceibing about family with the perfect portion. Last that i must tell are love the friendship relationship between those three. &quot;We should pursue the right thing at the right time&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "Sisters Ginger and Brigitte are walking through the park when Ginger is attacked by some sort of wolf that leaves her badly cut before they get away.  With Ginger on her period already she is upset about the various changes happening to her body but it is apparent to Brigitte that the changes occurring to Ginger are more sinister and she tries to find a solution.\n\nDespite the fact that the title is far too clever and silly for the film it announces this is actually a very strong teen horror.  In the midst of the usual teen slasher movies, this film stands out as one that doesn&apos;t fall into the usual clichés (either accidentally or knowingly) and just concentrates on being a good film.  The script cleverly uses the changes of teenage years and the changes of the werewolf as one and it works very well on the whole.  Ginger&apos;s change is gradual and well done by the script.\n\nThe film is gory but not in a bloodlust type way where teens are bumped off in gory ways for audience amusement.  Here the film builds gradually with blood a constant thing but not in a sensationalist way.  When the film comes to a close, it does well to not be diminishing by the sight of the wolf itself - often the hint of the creature is better than the actual effects, both work here.  The cast are good on the whole.  Of course the support cast do play the usual teen stereotypes but, unlike other of this genre, they are not just fodder.  The best playing comes from Isabelle and Perkins- the former especially giving a really good performance that makes the script alive.\n\nOverall this was a very pleasant surprise - a good teen horror movie.  It may lack the clichés of it&apos;s peers, and maybe that is why it is not as well known as the others, but it is a great little film and, if you need any further evidence of it&apos;s calibre - the ending is one of taste and restraint, words not often associated with teenage slasher movies."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Cowboy Bebop: Knocking on Heaven&apos;s Door&quot; is an animated feature based on a tv anime series (released on DVD) that has gained quite a following on both sides of the Pacific. It is interesting to note how Mr. Watanabe manages to pull off a balancing act required to satisfy both the loyal following of the tv series, to whom the introduction of principal characters and setting would be redundant, and to those who are relatively new to the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; universe, of which I am the latter.\n\nTo those not well versed in the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; lore, it takes some time to get familiar with various featured characters. The film begins in the same fashion as any of its self-contained tv episode would, in that not a lot of exposition is provided for grasping the setting. The characters are more or less introduced as &apos;bounty hunters&apos; and that is as much of a background the film lets on before establishing the main plot.\n\nIt is not too much of a setback not to be given any opportunity to become attached to any of the characters. They are there to simply convey various scenes of the main plot and arrange them into place before they culminate into an oft-tread climax. The plot is briskly disclosed (rather literally spelled out by dialogue, no implication) and turns out to be a fairly mundane yarn that does not break any new ground in narrative nor provide any catalyst for any interesting character development or revelation.\n\nThe symbolism and nuance that are laid thick in colorful locales and poignant sceneries may merit repeat viewings to appreciate them; a careful analysis of the film brings another level of enjoyment to overall experience. Also relationships between the characters and circumstantial developments of the plot seem to rely too impulsively on coincidence, not mindful of what the viewer is meant to discern. This could be attributed to attempting to weave a credible plot involving diverse elements and subplots in a limited frame of time, or it could have been something else relevant in the context of the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; tv series. Some have suggested that this film is nothing but a figurative dream, in which the main character confronts the guilt of his past to help him proceed to his ultimate fate in the last remaining episodes of the tv series. \n\nIf that was the case, then the film ends up being not as complete or entertaining to the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; novices as it would have been for those well acquainted with the tv series. To that effect, it is rather disappointing.\n\n&quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; features lush animation that features some of the most impressive displays of action sequences put to cel, particularly the confrontation at the medical lab between Spike and Electra, not to mention the prolonged martial no-holds-barred showdown between Vincent and Spike. The character designs are fairly distinct and varied, although in some instances they linger a bit too long on stereotypical depiction of some races. The details given to many of the locales are unsurpassed in their variety and ambience; it is a testament to how artists went as far as to include references to mainstream culture, dotting the background with &quot;WcDonald&apos;s&quot; and &quot;Kodac&quot; (although I am lead to believe such play on words is the Japanese equivalent of product placement).\n\nThe music is another highlight of the film, which is not unexpected of Yoko Kano, who is a renowned composer of anime soundtrack who have previously lent her resourceful talents to other popular anime such as &quot;Macross Plus&quot; (another collaboration with the director Watanabe). The compact blend of blues and jazz heightens the urgent mood and graces slower parts with an equally effective repertoire. I don&apos;t know about others, but I did not mind the dubbing of the film too much. Maybe because the voices are supported by a script that is partially altered to bring out genuine emotion to the dialogue and to resolve colloquial barriers between the languages.\n\n&quot;Cowboy Bebop: Knocking on Heaven&apos;s Door&quot; is a good standard action romp that is further enhanced by superb animation, equally enjoyable music, and more or less succeeds both as a tribute to the series&apos; fans and a good introduction of the series to those who might be interested in one of the better anime licenses to have come ashore. Recommended.",

I knew, walking in to screen this movie this morning, that this would lack that certain spark. I knew this would not be a Great Movie, but I expected it to be at least somewhat funny -- it is, after all, a comedy. And as for expecting the rest of it to be stupid, well, it went above and beyond: it was absolutely ridiculous.\n\nGenerally, I&apos;m indifferent to Mike Myers&apos; stupid (for lack of a better word) humor. There have been some genuinely funny moments in past movies, but you won&apos;t find more than two or maybe even three in this one. The entire movie was basically sexual innuendo after innuendo after innuendo after humping elephants.\n\nAt one point, I wanted to bash my head against a wall. This supposed &quot;comedy&quot; was absolute torture to sit through.\n\nBut Stephen Colbert is interesting -- has a few funny lines -- and Jessica Alba was very pretty. Also, Verne Troyer has quite the clever line -- in the credits, that is.\n\nI suppose one thing to say about this movie is, while not exactly in a positive light, it will likely always be in your memory, never forgotten. Although, keep in mind: seeing a movie should never hurt this much.",

I obviously cannot write a review at the present time but have nevertheless read the book.\n\nWhat no one mentions in all of the above comments is that Nathaniel Ayers was originally a Double Bass student at Julliard and NOT a cellist. That instrument-- along with the violin, trumpet, and piano, all came about later on. Put any instrument into his hands and he&apos;ll do his best to master it. \n\nHaving attended Yale university, I did not know him personally, even though we studied with one of the greatest bass teachers in the New York area at that time: Homer Mensch. Recently our paths did finally cross thanks to one of our mutual acquaintances, bassist and composer Joe Russo. Nathan likes to write down the names of his long lost good friends on walls, or any writing surface, and Joe&apos;s name is always there, scribbled amongst his favorites. This was where Steve noticed Joe&apos;s name and Googled him to look up his website. A new and close friendship resulted between them, and the many anecdotes that Joe pulled out of Nathan&apos;s past were worth their weight in gold to Steve, enough to devote the entire chapter 8 of the book to Joe!\n\nTo me, reading this book made me come to the conclusion that every man has his hour in life, and Nathan&apos;s time had come now. The chances of 2 men, one homeless and one not, being pulled together through the sound of a violin in a rush hour tunnel, were undoubtedly written in the stars. Through articles, a book and now a film on Nathan, Steve helped uplift a poor and abandoned part of society to a rank that it never imagined nor asked for, but morally deserved. We all know that the Internet is indeed capable of connecting and reconnecting people in the present, but only music can magically, throughout time, open the doors that connect all of us to one another."

      "reviewBody": "I have a strong eh feeling for &quot;Netflix original films&quot;, some impress most fall flat. The original shows are good, most of the films feel like direct to video and its easy to see why the films don&apos;t come to theaters. I had some real hesitation checking When We First Met for two reasons. One, I didn&apos;t take confidence in seeing Adam Devine (who is decent in doses) as a leading man. Second, I found the time loop/reliving the same day storyline a little stale since there&apos;s been some recent frequent takes on it. Oddly and surprisingly, I had a good time with this one.\n\nThe film is about a man named Noah (Devine), who meets the girl of his dreams at a Halloween Party. Three years pass and he has to watch her get engaged to another man. He soon discovers that returning to a photo booth at a jazz bar allows him to travel back in time and relive that Halloween and change his future. Naturally, things go wrong as he tries to woo the girl that he wants most and we get a nice laugh out of Noah&apos;s trials and tribulations.\n\nThe film had a few funny moments. Some of them caused me to laugh out loud. Devine really worked as a leading man, a lot of the funny would not have been possible with out his unique delivery. The time loop nature of the film wasn&apos;t so annoying. I mean, there were times where I felt the story dragged out but it wasn&apos;t so easy to predict how Noah was going to get the right formula to end up with the girl he loves. Overall, I can&apos;t deny that I was interested the whole way through.\n\nI do have a criticism that is kind of unrelated to the film. Why are internet stars like Andre Bachelor (who got famous off of vines) in so many movies now? I saw him do one with Logan Paul ffs. Yeah, lets keep it it real actors please. A fun time overall, I want to see Netflix bring more quality programming and not some hot garbage (Cloverfield Paradox, I&apos;m looking at you).\n\n7/10",

      "name": "&quot;Hot Pursuit&quot; brings together two great actresses each hitting their stride at the same time.",
      "reviewBody": "What do you get when you bring together two actresses whose careers developed almost completely opposite of each other? Well, if they&apos;re Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara, you get &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot; (PG-13, 1:27). Vergara&apos;s early acting gigs included several dramatic roles, but she&apos;s had her greatest successes in comedies. Witherspoon&apos;s career worked out the other way around. Known in recent years primarily for dramatic films, such as her Oscar-nominated role in &quot;Wild&quot; (2014) and her Oscar-winning turn in &quot;Walk the Line&quot; (2005), her early career was dominated by comedies. Before she got all serious on us, Witherspoon starred in the &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; movies (2001 and 2003), &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (2002) and &quot;Election&quot; (1999) – with two of those movies earning her Golden Globe nominations. Sofia Vergara doesn&apos;t have as many films under her bustier as Witherspoon, but she&apos;s definitely made her mark on screens big and small. Earlier in her career she found herself in deadly serious fare like &quot;The 24th Day&quot; (2004), &quot;Four Brothers&quot; (2005) and TV&apos;s &quot;Dirty Sexy Money&quot; (2007), but she really hit her stride in comedies. Her appearance in &quot;Machete Kills&quot; (2013) was an over-the-top hoot and, of course, she has been honing her craft on TV&apos;s &quot;Modern Family&quot; since 2009. Regardless of their previous roles, having two talented and beautiful actresses in the same film is bound to make it hot but is it worth pursuing?\n\nWitherspoon&apos;s character, Rose Cooper, literally grew up in her dad&apos;s San Antonio police cruiser and she wanted to be just like him. She did become a cop, but her overzealous nature alienated her from other officers and led to one big mistake that landed her evidence room duty in her police precinct. Vergara&apos;s character, Daniella Riva, is the wife of a drug cartel lieutenant who has agreed to testify against his boss, drug kingpin Vicente Cortez (Joaquin Cosio). Naturally, this arrangement puts a huge target on the backs of the Rivas. Cooper&apos;s police captain (John Carroll Lynch) gives her a chance to redeem her once promising career when he assigns her to help escort Mr. and Mrs. Riva to Dallas, where they are to testify. One thing leads to another and cop Cooper and diva Riva end up on the run from the cartel and crooked cops, as the pair are forced to depend on each other if they&apos;re going to get to Dallas safely.\n\nThe odd-couple pairing of Cooper and Riva is played for a lot of laughs – and a bit of drama. There are running jokes about Cooper&apos;s lack of height and overabundance of neurotic behaviors, as well as Riva&apos;s sex appeal and tough, but aloof attitude. The characters&apos; many differences give writers David Feeney and John Quaintance and director Anne Fletcher plenty of options for comedy and they seem to explore them all. The director and her stars give us some great sight gags and physical comedy, the writers give us a lot of funny lines and situations, and the plot throws us a couple curve balls that result in a third act that is equally dramatic and humorous. Witherspoon&apos;s performance is reminiscent of Sandra Bullock&apos;s characters in her cop comedies, but sweeter and funnier. Vergara is basically playing a close cousin of Gloria Delgado-Pritchett, but what works for her in her sitcom, works in this movie. &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot; may well be Witherspoon&apos;s best comedy to date and Vergara is nearly as funny in this film as she is on TV. These two actresses may have arrived at this comedy by way of very different roads, but I, for one, am glad they got there. The characterizations of Cooper and Riva are a little uneven and the plot is not terribly original, but the movie entertains. This may not be the hottest film in theaters this spring as it pursues the likes of the newest &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; and &quot;Avengers&quot; movies, but it is worth catching. &quot;B+&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "i just got back from a pre-screening of this in Dallas, and i must say i really enjoyed it. it seems like the whole audience enjoyed it as well, the theatre was often filled with laughter throughout this wonderful film.\n\ni&apos;m a fan of Sam Mendes&apos; work, and his work excelled here in the realm of comedy. John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph shared great chemistry as a couple expecting their first child and trying to decide where to settle down and raise their family. it&apos;s a bit of a coming-of- age story about people who should have already come-of-age, as we travel across the country along with them meeting quirky parents, friends, and old schoolmates.\n\nit&apos;s not all laughs, though. there are plenty of serious and introspective moments and my hat is off to Ms. Rudolph, generally known for her skills in comedy, for adding fine dramatic moments to her character. in the end, this movie doesn&apos;t offer any solutions to life&apos;s quirks, but it looks at them and even celebrates them.\n\nit&apos;s not Mendes&apos; best film, but it&apos;s a very enjoyable film with a great cast and lots of laughs, and should appeal to a pretty wide audience. it&apos;s a breath of fresh air from all of the Hollywood flash and crap that will be slopped across theater screens this summer. go see it!",

I thought Nitram in particular was underrated because of its subject sensitive matter.\n\nWhat Nitram did though, and this film never managed, was it made me look at things from a different perspective. The concept that the person behind a mass shooting is, exactly that, a person, is just nothing I had given consideration to before. Easier to label a monster (which they are, but there are reasons behind this) and move on than to think about it.\n\nI guess therefore I was expecting to try and understand something here. Like it was going to say something. But in the end it felt very procedural. Some white guys are racist because they are and some other guy hunts them down because he does. Honestly, that&apos;s about it.\n\nI never felt for a second like I understood anything about Nicholas Holts character or why he was a complete (insert word rhyming with duck) head. I guess there is an argument that you don&apos;t want to give oxygen but I feel this film maker has had a lot more to say in the past and if you aren&apos;t going to say anything then probably don&apos;t say anything at all.\n\nAnyway, not offensive but just very very average.",

      "reviewBody": "Bob (Matt Damon) and Walt (Greg Kinnear) are conjoined twins (joined at their lower trunks--they share a liver) from Massachusetts. They own a burger joint named &quot;Quickie Burger&quot; and Walt has a love of acting. Walt decides to move to California to try his luck at the big time, and although Bob is initially reluctant, he also has a beautiful &quot;Internet pal&quot; in California who he&apos;s been talking to for more than three years.\n\nCompared to some of directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly&apos;s other films, such as Dumb and Dumber, There&apos;s Something About Mary, and Me, Myself And Irene, we could say that the humor in Stuck On You is much more subtle. That fact may be off-putting to viewers who come to Stuck On You primarily as fans of the Farrelly Brothers&apos; previous work. There are still outrageous gags here, but they tend to be funnier if you exercise your intellect a bit, and believe it or not they are more rooted in reality than some other Farrelly Brothers films. If you are familiar with Daisy and Violet Hilton&apos;s story, for example--they were infamous sideshow performers who were conjoined twins--you&apos;ll note similarities, such as how they approached relationships with persons of the opposite sex.\n\nLike much of the Farrelly Brothers other work, however, Stuck On You is as heartwarming as funny, and on one level, it&apos;s primarily a very odd romance film. It also seems that perhaps this is the most personal of their films so far, and it may very well be a depiction of their love for each other as brothers. That also gives Stuck On You a slightly more serious edge, but one that works very well. This is a quality drama in addition to being a comedy leaning towards absurdism. That may sound like a strange combination, but it flowed smoothly for me as a viewer.\n\nThe performances by Damon and Kinnear are on target, and their love interests, May (Wen Yann Shih) and April (Eva Mendes) are intriguing and not at all clichéd. The extended cameos by Cher and Meryl Streep, as themselves, are very entertaining, and the supporting cast is excellent.",

There is the element of magic, of fairy-tale, of other-worldliness; there is the element of the naturalness, the character of Robert Redford; there is the element of baseball, the great sport-love of millions of boys in North America--and me back in the 1950s when I was growing up and dreamed of going to the majors; there&apos;s a touch of the sexual with Kim Basinger and Barbara Hershey----one could go on listing the pluses that this movie brings to the viewers. But I think what makes the movie in the end is the magic of Roy Hobbs as he hits a baseball further and harder than anyone ever has or(probably) ever will. Hobbs is the quintessence of the baseball hero and for sports lovers that&apos;s their religion. Hobbs is like Jesus come down to earth in the form of a baseball player, yet with sins of omission and commission. So, he&apos;s human and a superhero all at once."

And not to mention the lack of social awareness when it came to the women in the film. \n\nStay away... unless of course you have an undying love for Jude Law.

The plot while not bad is fairly predictable for anyone who has spent time watching police procedural shows. Many of the characters in the film also suffer from being cookie cutter clichés with about as much depth as a puddle. You know the crooked cop who is so bad he might as well be a cartoon character. However the movie moved along at a decent pace and the dialog was enjoyable, i even found myself laughing more than I thought I would. I imagine that fans of the t.v. series will enjoy this film more than I did. If you are not a fan of the t.v. series and you go in with moderate expectations you will enjoy it.",

      "name": "Terrific sleeper",
      "reviewBody": "Win Win is a terrific multigenre sleeper. It&apos;s funny, even hilarious; it has mystery and action; and it features brilliant performances by the always-reliable Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan. It&apos;s also not a movie that wallows in treacly messages, and it&apos;s not a movie that uses sports as a crutch for &quot;finding one&apos;s inner strength.&quot; In short, it&apos;s a wonderful, top-notch movie.\n\nGiamatti plays Mike Flaherty, a small-time lawyer who&apos;s running low on cash. He moonlights as coach of the local high-school team, which is, to put it bluntly, terrible. In a burst of fiscal sanity, Mike offers to become legal guardian for Leo, one of his clients (played by the crusty Burt Young), who&apos;s just been declared legally incapacitated. Why? Because as his guardian, Mike gets $1500 a month. But since he wants to avoid the extra hassle of actually taking care of Leo, he puts him in a nice home. Seriously, it&apos;s a nice home, with nice people and a big flat-screen TV.\n\nAt this point, the movie wants us on Mike&apos;s side – sort of. He needs the cash, and he doesn&apos;t really want to tell his wife Jackie (Ryan) that they&apos;re running low, not with two young daughters to care for as well. Plus he&apos;s coach of a terrible team and is just swimming in stress. Swimming in it. So much so that while jogging to work off the stress, he suffers a panic attack.\n\nJust when Mike thinks some of his problems have been solved, teenage Kyle (Alex Shaffer) walks into his life. Kyle, it turns out, his Leo&apos;s grandson, and they&apos;ve never met. Kyle&apos;s been sent by his mom to visit Leo. At first, this complicates things – especially when Kyle seems awfully reluctant to go back home to Ohio – but then Mike&apos;s remaining big problem is solved. It turns out the kid is a gifted wrestler. Who&apos;d have thought that? He looks scrawny, but in practices Kyle shows he has the mettle. And thus things are riding well for Mike.\n\nBut this would be a truly dull (if inspirational) movie if things continued to ride well. One thing we learn early on is that Mike intentionally misled the judge in Leo&apos;s case, giving the impression that he would be actively taking care of Leo. But things really get going when Kyle&apos;s druggie mom (Melanie Lynskey) shows up to bring her boy back – and to take over as Leo&apos;s guardian.\n\nToo often, Giamatti has played real sad-sack characters, guys who just can&apos;t seem to catch a break, guys who suffer at the hands of fickle fate. Not so here. Mike isn&apos;t exactly a conniving mastermind, but he&apos;s not an idiot, either, and he deals with each situation with logic and reason, even as they spiral further out of his control. It&apos;s a typically masterful Giamatti performance, and for once he&apos;s not a total loser who&apos;s in over his head. He&apos;s even a half-decent coach who simply has a lackluster team to work with.\n\nGiamatti&apos;s not alone, though. I really got a kick out of Amy Ryan&apos;s performance as his somewhat-exasperated spouse Jackie, who&apos;s not terribly fond of suddenly having a teenage boy around at first. A few years back, Ryan turned in an Oscar-nominated performance as a native Bostonian in Gone Baby Gone. Ryan had a thick, believable Boston accent then. Here, she&apos;s playing a New Jersey native, but at no point does she go overboard with the Jersey Shore dialect. That&apos;s what good actresses can do – they can dial it back when they have to and show a little nuance.\n\nWin Win is not a stand-up-and-cheer movie, although the audience at the screening I attended applauded when it was over. It&apos;s not a crime drama, and it doesn&apos;t really have a lot of twists to its plot. What makes it work are all of the truly sincere, dead-on performances: by Giamatti, Ryan, Shaffer, Lynskey, Bobby Cannavale, and even Jeffrey Tambor as one of Mike&apos;s wrestling assistant coaches. Not a sour note in the bunch, everyone at the top of his or her game.\n\nThis might have fared well, critically, if it were released during awards season. It sort of reminded me of last year&apos;s Greenburg, starring Ben Stiller, only funnier and sweeter. Win Win is a charming, quiet movie that reminds us that, as the Grateful Dead once told us, once in a while you can get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right.",

      "reviewBody": "Only a few of the previous comments on this movie has mentioned the use of music. Just like in Trois Couleurs Bleu, the music of La Double vie de Véronique is very indivisible from the film: the visual and the auditive form a united whole and also elements of it are directly part of the story. And when it comes to music made for film, Zbigniew Preisner&apos;s powerful score for this one is as good as it gets.\n\nWhen there is little dialogue, it is not just the images and expressions on Irène Jacob&apos;s face that tells the story, but also the powerful strains of music intermingled with it.\n\nEven with just these elements in place, it would be a movie worth seeing, though obviously a narrative based in little extent on dialogue and with less emphasis on a clear-cut story than your average American movie is unfortunately lost on some of the earlier commentators.\n\nAnd even this seemingly sparingly laid out narrative reveals itself to the careful watcher to be a rich tapestry of symbols, metaphors and hidden meanings. Kiéslowski, just as in his other movies, demands participation of the viewer, and the one who expects passive entertainment has found the wrong film to watch.\n\nKrzysztof never liked discussing meaning when it came to his movies, but liked keeping that up to the viewers, and few other directors have ever been able to lay out more food for thought and fruitful interpretation than him.\n\nI saw the Three Colours trilogy before seeing Véronique, and the many similarities, both musical and in visual narrative, makes it feel like it almost belongs together with those three to form a quartet. In some ways it has more in common with Blue than Red and White do. \n\nHad Juliette Binoche also been cast in the role of Véronique, as I understand that Krzysztof originally had intended, the similarities had been even greater. She was, however, occupied with shooting Les Amants du Pont-Neuf at the time I believe, and so Krzysztof opted for the less experienced Irène. I don&apos;t think the film is any worse for it: she is brilliant, and not just a pretty face as some people put it, but a very intelligent and aware actress as anyone who has seen her interview for the Red DVD release should discover if they haven&apos;t already.\n\nIn short: a wonderful film, wonderful music, great acting. But not a movie for everyone.",

(Luckily my trip was not so eventful!) While of course the movie was more personal for me since I could really relate to a lot of the scenes about life on the train and in the stations, this movie will appeal to anyone who likes a good mystery. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and is really well-done. And it definitely captures the current political and social climate of Russia today. Having dealt with the border guards in Siberia (over a visa problem) I witnessed first hand the &apos;wild west&apos; mentality that currently exists in that country. It may be hard for Americans to believe that the events that occur in this movie are realistic. But they are. And Woody Harrelson is a revelation. Ben Kingsley is great as always. I was not familiar with Emily Mortimer prior to this film but I will be on the lookout for her next film. It&apos;s a shame not many people will see this movie. Hopefully they&apos;ll catch it on pay per view. Highly recommended.",

The chemistry between the two was a delight.\n\nThis is not your typical over the top FX SciFi. It is an action drama with an underlying love story that would interest, even those who don&apos;t like this genre. But then I suppose if John Carpenter were to make a movie about the number 2758.369, it would be a interesting!\n\nWhat more can I say - Great stuff!",

But before he even executes his first crime, he is discovered by a lonely little girl in need of a friend.  Chaos soon ensues as Jenny and Oliver get caught up in a kidnapping by the classic evil villain.\n\nIt&apos;s a fun filled romp to be enjoyed by one and all over and over again.",

The death scenes were sorta clever and Jason to me looked at his best. The 1st scene was a little stupid though coming back through lightening get real. From then on was kewl and Jennifer Cooke&apos;s performance was pretty good as well. I wish they showed her boobs though but sadly they didn&apos;t have any cleavage in this film . I know shocking isn&apos;t it.\n\nAlso the way they killed Jason was pretty original. Having little kids there made it even better. Although this is the best in the series in my opinion its still just another Friday the 13th sequel there nothing special about at all and to tell the truth it had it shouldn&apos;t have ever been made just like all the rest of the F13 films after part 3. To tell the truth like Freddy said in the features on the DVD Jason is very boring and slow. He just walks *Hack hack* and then your dead hes not ruthless as most call hes teddy bear compared to the other killers and how they torture their victims.\n\nPeople really like Jason for some reason I don&apos;t know why but I can&apos;t stand him I&apos;m more of a Myers fan thank you very much. Although I don&apos;t like Jason this film wasn&apos;t so bad.",

For all of the heart wrenching scenes in this movie, you never once feel as though Streep is going over-the-top. That says alot for someone who spends just about half of the time in her scenes with a tear in her eye. Everything about her performance just seems so effortless and natural. This especially shows when she is speaking German flawlessly, or English with a very convincing Polish accent.\n\nThe fact that Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol are not completely lost in this movie says alot for their performances. Kline himself delivers a great performance of a man suffering from delusions and bi-polar syndrome. It is one of his greatest performances as well. Peter MacNicol plays the role of a character who pales in comparison to the other characters. MacNicol has the somewhat undesirable task of having to play the character who carries the least amount of baggage. He therefore might be overlooked, when viewing at the movie as a whole. However, MacNicol does a great job with the character, not trying to make more out of it than it is supposed to be. His role is very important to this movie.\n\nBut the real story here is Streep. Her performance would be a stand out against any other performance in history. I honestly believe that. Streep just digs down deep here - delivering lines that just put a chill down your spine.",

      "reviewBody": "Grieving the loss of her mother Amanda Cartwright (Malin Akerman), a one-time horror scream queen, young girl Max Cartwright (Taissa Farmiga) is thrown into the film that made her mother famous, the 80&apos;s slasher flick, &quot;Camp Bloodbath&quot;. Very a-kin to &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, a slasher/serial kill is on the loose murdering the kids. Billy Murphy (Daniel Norris) was teased to death by the camp mates and wants his bloody revenge. Max and her friends (Alia Shawkat, Alexander Ludwig, Thomas Middleditch and Nina Dobrev) must work with the camp mates to try and survive.\n\nI was dubious about this film when I read the summary. Not only was it littered with &apos;kids&apos;, it was also on a cable channel which is not known for quality films. I watched it all the same and was pleasantly surprised at it. It is a weird re-hash, parody, and homage all in one. It was like &quot;Scream&quot; (1996) the way it knew it&apos;s content, crossed with &quot;The Last Action Hero&quot; (1993) the way it poked fun at itself, and &quot;Cabin in the Woods&quot; (2011) the way it developed - but just a little cuter, colourful and fluffier. It does not take itself too seriously, nor the genre that it is working with, nor the era that the &apos;original&apos; movie was set in. There are times where it is cheesy and camp, there are times where it looks cheap - but all in all it works. Plenty of clichés and standard slasher tropes but used well to get the plot across rather than thrown in just to use them. I would not necessarily say that this film is scary, more an adventure film set in a horror film. I imagine it&apos;s kind of like what would happen if the current MTV generation took a virtual tour of an 80&apos;s slasher/horror film. There is nothing too offensive, plenty of suggestion rather than action, a little bit of bad language, very mild drink and drugs use, nudity and some violence and gore (but used as much in comedy as in horror).\n\nWhile this film was pleasantly surprising and nice, it&apos;s the kind of film I could most of the family in front of, whereas, personally, I prefer the kind of films you can&apos;t safely put family members in front of for fear of offending them. Give me &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (1980), &quot;The Burning&quot; (1981), &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; (1983), or even &quot;Cheerleader Camp&quot; (1988). But still, this was a lighthearted way to reminisce, it was fun, and at 91 mins it was easy to sit through. Released in 2015 with a relatively low budget of $4.5 million, I am sure you will catch this film repeated on cable channels in the future, so I say, why not give it a go. 7 /10",

It becomes a little boring after the endless cuts between three different settings where each new shot is quite similar to the last one in the respective setting. But, the dialouge between Redford and the student is interesting. Lots of people are saying its &quot;patronizing&quot;...I didn&apos;t really feel that. Apparently that would make me stupid according to some that have commented on this film. But, I didn&apos;t really feel that was the intent, feel of it. It&apos;s more of a &quot;set back and look at YOUR life and ask yourself if you&apos;re really doing all you could be&quot; type of film. I only give it six stars because of the ending and because I feel the film lacks enough texture and becomes a little dry throughout.",

You can not cater same food in the name of action , YRF Spy Universe , particularly after brilliant War &amp; Pathan .\n\nSallu mian has started looking old. Katrina Kaif got an overdose of action though her towel fight in a Turkish Hamam with the Chinese marshal art expert is a great sequence . The actor to watch is Emraan Hashmi , the cool bad man is not intending to wipe India from world&apos;s map , rather want to assassinate the Pak PM and take charge first but director Maneesh Sharma is not Kabir Khan.\n\nA perfect example of a creation where action overshadowed acting . Watch it for only a cameo of Sharukh Khan .

Specially if they had picked up from the events from Bogus Journey. But alas, that movie was written as a finale and not planned to have a sequel.\n\nThe gender swap of little Bill and little Ted was troublesome at first, but given the most excellent and honest performances by the two actresses mimicking their movie dads, it was quickly forgiven.\n\nThat being said, that I wished it would&apos;ve been better written with higher character development and a bolder comedy standard? Most definitely.\n\nThat I enjoyed it? Yes, I kinda did but I think it was because I wasn&apos;t expecting much due to the state those long term sequels are working nowadays. Would I recommend it? No, not really. The movie is non, non, non-bogus, but it&apos;s also non-Excellent.\n\nEither way, remember the lesson from the first two and Be Excellent to each other.",

The three leading actors did phenomenal work but my favourite was Nitanshi Goel as Phool. Her innocence was enough to make me fall in love with her and root for her throughout the film.\n\nThe scene where Phool gets her first salary is just so heartwarming! From being this naive young girl in a completely unfamiliar place to finding her strength and becoming financially independent, her journey was beautiful. The film is wonderfully developed, and it works as a true dramedy, a positive one at that, where we are shown there is something good out of everything. You feel for the characters since the beginning and celebrate their success. Sparsh Srivastava as Deepak is so lovable and Pratibha as Jaya is witty. The bonding all the characters manage to develop is lovely. The way Phool calls out to Deepak and they both hug each other while crying, it&apos;s best scene in the whole film ! The scene where Deepak secretly holds Phool&apos;s hand and she looks at him and then after a point, lets go off her ghunghat while they keep holding hands had me with butterflies in my stomach !!! Lovely film !!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Great Outdoors&quot; is what anyone would expect of a John Candy movie: completely goofy, but funny nonetheless. He plays Chet Ripley, taking his family on vacation in the wilderness. Unfortunately, Chet&apos;s unpleasant brother-in-law Roman Craig (Dan Aykroyd) is also there, and he just has to make everything miserable for Chet. In some ways, this movie seems to be rehashing &quot;Summer Rental&quot;, but with a different tone. My favorite parts were the raccoons, the bear, and The Old &apos;96er (I don&apos;t recommend that scene for squeamish people). All in all, it just goes to show what the world lost when John Candy died. He was really great.\n\nP.S.: Annette Bening, in her debut, plays Roman&apos;s wife Kate.",

You never really know what was behind the need for these second chances, but that doesn&apos;t matter, you feel for these people, and a lot of that is to do with Gene Hackman.\n\nOne of my favourite actors, Hackman pulls off a fantastic performance here, with an amazing backup from Dennis Hopper. What a combination.\n\nPassion, guts, determination, and without too much of a sickly taste in the mouth. A lovely film to watch.",

The best comes from R. Madhavan and Janki Bodiwala. Both have played their roles exceptionally well. Ajay Devgn, Jyothika, and Anngad Raaj also have played their roles really well.\n\nThe first half of the film does a good job in initially building the family dynamic so that when R. Madhavan enters we feel for each member of the family. After the good first half the second half starts off a bit slow as not much happens. However it does eventually become fine leading to a good second half of the film.\n\nOverall a good enjoyable film and I recommend it.",

The time has changed, so he has to adapt to it and I think he&apos;s doing okay. Only haters/film critics keep hating him. This is a Netflix production and Sandler in a mysterious role. He teams up with his old school friend and they fake their deaths to begin a new life. But the identities they have borrowed ones are even in the bigger troubles which begins to haunt them as well. So coming out of it is the remaining film to tell.\n\nThe storyline seems just okay. Since it is not fresh enough, they did not even overuse the concept to build plot with clichés. Kind of guessable twists, but it will work for most of the people. Better stunt sequences for such a comedy flick. Good performances and it was a smooth sail according to the film&apos;s pace. The director and Sandler had given a few good comedies back then, and this fresh collaboration was decent. So don&apos;t believe the film critics (Rotten Tomatoes &amp; Metacritic), elsewhere it is rated much better, but still somewhat underrated. If you are seeking a decent action-comedy, this is worth a try.\n\n7/10",

He does not exactly have to stretch his acting muscle but you do end up hoping he will win through. Although much of the violence is not right in your face in parts it does carry on that bit long although this is used to separate the &quot;no morals, no borders&quot; team from the good guys within the production cast. This movie serves up exactly what it promises but is still an entertaining movie. I would recommend to a friend.",

      "reviewBody": "Instead of frequently used movie adjectives such as &quot;Riveting,&quot; or &quot;Unbelievable,&quot; the &quot;Sharknado&quot; billboard uses the descriptive words, &quot;Enough Said.&quot; I don&apos;t know why but these words make me laugh, and they set the tone for this ridiculously silly movie. I love scary movies when the enemy is not a real threat to me or any other movie watcher. Therefore, I don&apos;t watch stalker or slasher movies.\n\nThere are sharks coming from every direction when they&apos;re catapulted into the sky by a freak storm that carries them everywhere. No place is safe.\n\nCommon sense is rarely used in this type of movie. I&apos;ll admit that &quot;The Birds&quot; is in a different league, but I always wonder why no one thinks to wear a hat that could deter at least some of the birds for awhile, especially a construction hat or football helmet. In Sharknado the sharks are vicious and hungry. Why no one in this movie can get away from these sharks baffles me. There are so many that its easy to get pelted by one. Pelted and then chewed, even swallowed. No one seems to remember that sharks can&apos;t walk or run on the land. Once they land on the ground, they would be stuck without rushing water to move them along.. Our hero---played by Ian Ziering---and his family and friends must take a proactive approach to fight these big fish while waiting for the torrential storms to pass.\n\nThis movie has some great foreshadowing. You can predict that certain characters will not be around much longer. But who cares? If you don&apos;t mind watching people get dismembered, or even swallowed, you may enjoy this movie as much as I did."

The movie really touches on some social issues in schools and of life in general, but saying that would be a spoiler. Amazing camera work and production design. The movie gives a 80s retro vibe, I liked it very much. The writing was nice, especially the plot twists were revealled very smothly and also impacts us to an extent. The music was nice, gave the movie a youthful vibe and was also fun to listen.\n\nThe issue I had with the movie is the climax. Felt a bit rushed. The issues got solved pretty quick.

In this story Ben Affleck has lost his wife, his son has died and he has lost every dream or hope he has ever had. He only drinks himself into oblivion to numb his pain. Will he in some way be able to start coping with the death of his young son, which caused him to start drinking in the first place? That&apos;s the heart of this touching movie.\n\nThe good: Terrific acting performance of an alcohol addict by Ben Affleck. Subtle direction of this drama by director Gavin O Conner. Really touching and UPLIFTING story.\n\nAny bad? Well, it&apos;s certainly not a straight forward success sports movie. It&apos;s quite bleak and depressing at moments, because the real focus of this movie is about Ben Affleck&apos;s alcohol addiction and some might not like to watch such a slowburning movie about such a bleak subject...

      "reviewBody": "Like &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot; is a tale of forbidden love set in the Middle Ages (although it far predates Shakespeare&apos;s work both in setting and in origin). In this case, the two young lovers are separated along national lines, with Tristan a young Briton, and Isolde nothing less than the princess of Ireland. As their two countries do battle against one another, the benighted couple tries desperately to make their love work in a bitterly hostile world.\n\nThis is a handsome, well-crafted film, glorious to look at but tedious to sit through. Since we&apos;ve seen so many of these tales already, it&apos;s a little hard for us to work up much passion for this one - even if, as we&apos;re told, the fate of an entire kingdom hangs on this relationship. Moreover, there is such a profusion of Angles, Saxons, Irish etc. running around on screen that it is often difficult to distinguish one from the other and to know just who is fighting whom (or who is allied with whom) at any given moment.\n\nJames Franco and Sophia Myles make for a fairly bland, conventionally modern young couple, but Rufus Sewell provides a subtle, sympathetic performance as the man who both raises Tristan and marries Isolde.\n\nIf Medieval romances are your cup of tea, by all means check out &quot;Tristan and Isolde,&quot; but there are far better tales of unrequited love around than this one.",

When I was told that I could pick an older movie for free because I was renting a new release, I looked around and Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo was sitting right there, so I grabbed it.(hey, Rob Schneider has always been cool with me) When I sat down to watch it I had low to no expectations, because I heard that the movie was pretty terrible, but to my pleasant surprise, it wasn&apos;t that bad. They got me to laugh out loud quite a few times within the first couple of minutes and it continued throughout, I found that the story was actually interesting (for this type of movie), and I enjoyed the characters. The female lead, Eva, is gorgeous and hot, while sweet and innocent at the same time. I thought she was Anna Farris from the picture on the back of the DVD, and was slightly disappointed to find out it wasn&apos;t her, but I really enjoyed Hanna Verboom, my new celebrity crush.\n\nI can do without Eddie Griffin and all the filth, which is on display rather frequently in this movie, but for some reason, I almost didn&apos;t mind it here. I didn&apos;t find that it was the &quot;How many times can we use the F word in 90 minutes&quot;-athon like 40-Year Old Virgin and other films are. Although they do over use the whole &quot;gigolo&quot; verbiage. I mean, are we suppose to still be laughing about it after 2 whole movies filled to the brim with words like &quot;man-whore&quot;, &quot;he-bitch&quot;, etc. being spoken every other minute? \n\nI honestly cannot understand why this movie is panned to the level that it is, with some people calling it the &quot;worst movie ever made&quot;. It is actually pretty good for a cheap, crass, comedy. Be assured that you can do a lot worse, if you do decide to check this film out. It was much better than I thought it&apos;d be, and from what I can remember, it was at least on par with the first movie.",

Its pure slapstick humor, that is enjoyable for anyone who&apos;s familiar with the Vacation movies &amp; the crazy Griswold family.\n\n&apos;Vegas Vacation&apos; Synopsis: In the fourth outing for the vacation franchise, the Griswolds have to survive Vegas fever when they go to Las Vegas for a fun family vacation.\n\n&apos;Vegas Vacation&apos; doesn&apos;t get every joke or gag right, but at most parts, you laugh at the silliness. Its purely an entertaining comedy, that has been made only to make you laugh. And to a large extend, the makers have succeeded! \n\nElisa Bell&apos;s Screenplay is spirited, although not everything works, particularly that one segment featuring a lecherous Vegas singing star who goes head over heels for Mrs Griswold. Stephen Kessler&apos;s Direction is pretty decent. Cinematography &amp; Editing are alright.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Chevy Chase is in terrific form. He nails the part of the wacky leader of a dysfunctional family &amp; brings the house down on numerous occasions. Beverly D&apos;Angelo has also done very well. Randy Quaid is first-rate. Marisol Nichols is passable. Ethan Embry doesn&apos;t really impress. Wayne Newton is wasted.\n\nOn the whole, &apos;Vegas Vacation&apos; has some genuine laugh-out-loud moments. So for that alone, I&apos;d suggest you check this one out.",

      "reviewBody": "Josh (Ben Stiller) is a documentary filmmaker at a crossroads in his career after having made a good debut feature. His wife Cornelia (Naomi Watts) is a producer with a famous father as a documentary filmmaker (Charles Grodin). Now crawling towards middle age, the couple seem unfulfilled somewhat, as they are unable to have a child, unlike most of their close friends.\n\nEnter tyro filmmaker Jamie Fletcher (Adam Driver) and his girlfriend Darby (Amanda Seyfried), two twentysomethings who not only appear full of life, but seem willing to look up to Josh as an example of a competent filmmaker. Jamie embarks on his career, and never looks back.\n\nNoah Baumbach&apos;s film has strong echoes of ALL ABOUT EVE, with the scheming Jamie trying every trick in the book to advance himself at Josh&apos;s expense, while pretending to be friendly. Yet WHILE WE&apos;RE YOUNG manages to make some important points about the angst associated with middle age: Josh wants to be young once more, and is prepared to ape Jamie&apos;s mode of dress, as well as trying to enjoy the youngsters&apos; leisure pursuits. Neither prove very satisfying for the older filmmaker, and in the end he comes to acknowledge the fact of growing old.\n\nYet Baumbach also has some trenchant points to make about the documentary filmmaker&apos;s art. Do they exist to record life around them - as Leslie (Grodin) claims in a climactic speech, or do they cut corners and fabricate life in search of a good story? What is a &quot;good&quot; story anyway? The film has great fun skewering some of Josh&apos;s more pretentious flights of fancy as he struggles to finish a six and a half hour documentary that has already taken him ten years. He has written something far too long and boring (it&apos;s clear that Baumbach would never be a fan of the work of Claude Lanzmann, whose SHOAH lasts almost the same length of time).\n\nYet Baumbach never lets the action get too serious. The script is full of witty lines, and the performances are cleverly drawn. The New York locations also provide an effective backdrop to the action, with the seedy filmmakers&apos; studios contrasting with the opulence of Lincoln Center.",

      "reviewBody": "I feel compelled to write a review on this film, but I&apos;m just not sure what to focus on or how to outline what I loved about it. The story is so unique, and so left of centre, that it&apos;s very hard to describe, let alone break down and review. When attempting to describe it to a friend, I found it very difficult, as it just sounds so crazy. It makes one think, how could this be that enjoyable. All I could really say was, &apos;you have to watch this film!&apos;, as it made me smile, laugh and connect, from opening scene to closing credits.\n\nAfter seeing the trailer for this, I was immediately interested. Mainly because of the crazy, ab-lib, don&apos;t-give-a-s**t nature of Hesher, actually reminded me of a friend, and this friend&apos;s antics and philosophy on life always amuse me, and more often than not, enlighten me to how this crazy world can be, and how you really shouldn&apos;t take things so seriously. Having such excitement for an upcoming film, you can quite often be let down. Luckily for me Hesher stood up, and was everything I hoped it would be, and more.\n\nI found the story to be simply brilliant. So random and unpredictable you never really knew where it was going, or what was going to happen next. I loved the way in which Hesher makes he&apos;s first appearance in the film, and how he somehow, without trying (so it seems), finds he&apos;s place in Grandma&apos;s home. The dialogue was simply gold and oh so funny at times, that it made me want to re-watch the film as soon as it concluded, to pick up on the quick wit and laugh all over again. The scene at the pool was definitive for me. So funny and so strange. I couldn&apos;t help but enjoy and admire the way Hesher went about things in that scene, letting himself completely go, without a fear of consequence. Acting on he&apos;s most primal impulse. Not so much in anger, but in freedom, and having fun at the expense of a few &apos;versatile solutions for modern living&apos;.\n\nHesher is an amazing character, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant. This might sound ridiculous to some, but I think it was worthy of an award, as this is a true embodiment of a character. There is no Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this film, there&apos;s only Hesher. I haven&apos;t seen that many of Joseph&apos;s movies, but I do remember &apos;500 Days Of Summer&apos;, and this is polar opposites as far as role is concerned, and not many actors could make such a leap, convincingly. I also became a fan of Natalie Portman after this. I love the fact she took on a role that was so different. Her character&apos;s plainness, honesty, and self-confessed faults, made her simply beautiful to watch throughout. Devin Brochu as the main boy which the story revolves around is amazing. He&apos;s level of dramatic execution is spot on in every scene, and he&apos;s so believable as TJ. The film has such rich characters, which are all played to perfection. The Grandma is also worthy of a mention, providing so much love to an otherwise somewhat tragic story.\n\nThis film manages to mix humour, sadness and heart like very few films can. Its films like this that can pick people up and put them back on their feet. It actually made me feel better about life, and less worried about the ridiculous incidentals that can make us anxious and get us down. I&apos;m not sure how this film managed to tap into such thoughts and emotions, but somehow it did. There is no comparative circumstance in the film for me, nor is there an obvious message that everyone can relate to, it is simply a story with colourful characters, with simple lives, told in such a unique and crazy way, that for some reason you commit to it and totally embrace it, only to feel on top of the world for having done so.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Report&apos; couldn&apos;t get made at a better time. With everything happening in today&apos;s American and global political climate, it shows how little the general public actually is allowed to know about whatever happens within the borders of their government buildings. An entire country is at stake when secrets come out, that shouldn&apos;t have been secrets in the first place when laws get executed correctly.\n\nIdealistic Senate staffer Daniel J. Jones (Adam Driver), gets tasked by his boss, Senator of California Diane Feinstein (Annette Bening), to lead an investigation into the CIA&apos;s post 9/11 Detention and Interrogation Program. Jones&apos; relentless pursuit of the truth leads to findings that uncover the lengths to which the nation&apos;s top intelligence agency went to destroy evidence, subvert the law, and hide a shocking secret from the American public.\n\nScott Z. Burns hasn&apos;t directed a feature length film since 2006&apos;s &apos;Pu-239&apos;. Having previously written films such as, &apos;The Laundromat&apos;, &apos;Side Effects&apos; and &apos;Contagion&apos;, it seems he has a very good work relationship with this films&apos; producer Steven Soderbergh (director of last named films). With &apos;The Report&apos; he knows what he&apos;s going for and doesn&apos;t hold back on any occasion. The story goes off like a missile, and only slows down when hitting its target at the finish line. That might be a challenge for some viewers, but the suspense throughout the second and third act is rare and delivers what political polymaths are looking for. To those who aren&apos;t particularly interested in politics and cover-ups, this might be a tough one to sit through.\n\nAdam Driver, is truly on a roll these last couple of years. With two more films on the horizon in the last two months of 2019 (&apos;Marriage Story&apos; and &apos;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&apos;), it seems there&apos;s no stopping him in becoming one of the most talented actors of this generation. He shows just how focused and career driven he is as his character Daniel J. Jones. He&apos;s unsurpassed and will definitely get recognition for his hard work coming awards season.\n\nWhat plays like a political &apos;Social Network&apos;, could&apos;ve benefited from a rewrite by Aaron Sorkin, just to streamline it a bit more. The dialogues are heavy and littered with dark humour, but without any real character development, it misses the opportunity to make the audience connect with anyone on a deeper level. You never get to look behind the suits into their homes. The mental struggles of being accused of whistleblowing and torturing people, must take its toll on politicians and CIA-agents, no? We get little hints at their personal lives when being interrogated by government officials, but this is all just small talk. It does go without saying, Greg O&apos;Bryant deserves much praise for editing this film. I wonder how long the rough cut must&apos;ve been.\n\nThere&apos;s a wide range of well known actors passing by as fundamental characters in the big scheme of things. Annette Bening, brilliant actor taking on the full look and characteristics of Senator Feinstein, doesn&apos;t have many explosive scenes to wow, but is subtly captivating. Corey Stoll, Jon Hamm, Maura Tierney and Michael C. Hall all have important parts to keep things moving, but with the little amount of screen time fail to impress with anything more than acceptable.\n\nBurns&apos; &apos;The Report&apos; is an important watch, delivering facts in a striking manner. It&apos;s worth watching for Driver&apos;s performance alone, observing a man who loves doing his job and excels at it. A history lesson in American politics and terrorism with a little dig at propaganda filmmaking and journalism, and a big spotlight on the CIA&apos;s misconduct.",

      "reviewBody": "How much one likes `The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps&apos; depends on how much Eddie Murphy you can stand.  After grossing more than $125 million at the box office, I would have to conclude that moviegoers couldn&apos;t get enough. This sequel is a one-man show built around a character skit from the first movie.  Murphy plays eight different roles and gives a tour de force performance without the benefit of any story whatever.  I got the impression that the writers were superfluous anyway, since Murphy was obviously ad libbing about 90% of the time.\n\nThe humor is lowbrow and delivers a good deal of physical comedy laced with sexual innuendo.  Though Murphy&apos;s caricatures are consistently droll, they rely too much on unflattering stereotypes of blacks.  The first dinner scene is a rehash of the dinner scene from the first film.  After that scene, most of the film is a repetition of the same tired sight gags.  Though Murphy&apos;s amusing electricity runs through every character, once the novelty wears off the film&apos;s appeal wears thin.\n\nKudos to the makeup department for an outstanding job on Murphy&apos;s various alter egos.  Otherwise, the production of this film was nothing out of the ordinary.  Larry Miller also gets a very honorable mention as the obnoxious Dean Richmond, getting his just deserts at the hands of a giant hamster.\n\nThis film has some laughs but not enough substance for a feature length movie.  I rated it a 6/10.  Add two or three points if you are an Eddie Murphy fan.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film yesterday, and went in with no idea what to expect. All I knew was it was a new Woody Allen movie with Collin Farrell, Ewan McGregor, and Tom Wilkinson, and supposedly rather dark.\n\nDark it was, but not overwhelmingly so. Farrell and McGregor play London brothers who are hard-up for cash, both with love interests that they&apos;re looking to take care of. Their rich Uncle Howard (Wilkinson) agrees to help them out as usual, if they do him a favor and &quot;get rid of&quot; a business relation who poses a threat to his finances. Despite many doubts, their situations are pressing, and the young men agree. The story then follows the different ways they deal with the factual immorality of what they have done.\n\nIt&apos;s not exactly a cheery film, but it isn&apos;t quite an intense, ominous drama, either, like the somewhat similar brothers-in-trouble based melodrama &apos;Before the Devil Knows You&apos;re Dead&apos; that was recently released. In &apos;Dream,&apos; there&apos;s a thin layer of dark humor that adds a refreshing twist here and there.\n\nEverything was good on the acting end, though not mind-blowing; both McGregor and especially Farrell gave strong performances. The story, though rather predictable, is still enjoyable. Nice use of London and the British countryside on Allen&apos;s part. Overall, it&apos;s a solid film that will entertain, but that&apos;s about it."

      "reviewBody": "Bring out the popcorn, grab a cola and get ready for 2 and a half hours of laughs, songs, color, emotions, and spoofs. If you&apos;re a fan of the Indian film industry and have kept up with the news, Om Shanti Om is for you. If you love entertainment to the max, OSO is definitely for you! Farah Khan&apos;s Om Shanti Om spares nobody, not even its makers when it comes to poking fun. OSO is a film about films, it&apos;s a film in a film and above all, it&apos;s made to celebrate the biggest film producing industry - The Indian Film Industry.\n\nOm Prakash is a junior artist who thrives to become a lead hero one day. He is a horrible actor and has a mother who hams more than him. Om has another dream: To win over a star, Shanti-Priya. One circumstance leads to another which leads to Om being a witness to the death of Shanti by producer Mukesh Mehra. Om also gets killed in the incident. That same night, Om is reborn as Om Kapoor. Will Om realize his past-life? Will he avenge Shanti&apos;s death? As the tagline suggests: For some dreams, one life-time is not enough.\n\nOSO has a done-to-death story. But that&apos;s not the point. The film is a parody of films and the ones working in it. Notice the spoofs on the yesteryear stars such as Manoj Kumar. A controversial scene but one can&apos;t deny it&apos;s hilarious. Not to forget spoofs on Govinda, Keshtu Mukherjee, and Suraj Bharjateeyaa. Of course the most memorable comic scene has to be SRK pretending to be a south Indian actor. &quot;Mind It&quot; OSO&apos;s first half is gripping and keeps the viewer alert. The drama folds the right way. The second half loses steam at times. It&apos;s not bad, but unlike Farah&apos;s first film where the second half competed well with the first, it stars to slow down a bit. It picks back up, fortunately.\n\nThe spoofs aren&apos;t less hilarious in the second half. The film pokes fun of a lot of celebs and Indian film industry issues. To start, SRK being late is a spoof on himself being late to sets in real life. Not to forget the whole dard-e-disco song is a spoof on item numbers. The high point of the second half has to be the award ceremony. The spoof on Abhishek Bachchan is subtle yet funny. SRK doing the same roles and being nominated is remarkably funny. Not to forget Akshay KUmar&apos;s outburst at the awards is aplaudworthy and rib-tickling. Subash Ghai-Rishi Kapoor spoof is funny too.\n\nFlaws? As mentioned, the second half falters in some parts. Also, SRK remembering his past so quickly seems rushed and unconvincing.\n\nThe climax, however, is a pleasant surprise.\n\nSpecial Mention - The Deewangee song is a treat to the eyes. 31 stars in one song is no joke and they all look nothing short of spectacular. Special mention to the ones that caught my eye with their appearance. Dharmendra, Jatendra, Kajol, Salman, Saif, Sanju, Rekha etc all do well alongside Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nFarah Khan and her team of writers have put some genius into parts of the movie. The writing is witty, smart, and quite innovative. Dilague is first rate.\n\nVishal-Shekar&apos;s music is amazing. With a variety of songs in one film, they do a wonderful job.\n\nFarah&apos;s direction is first rate. She handles all the moments with ease. It&apos;s not a better film than Main Hoon Na, but still a good job.\n\nIn 2007, 3 months before OSO released; SRK unleashed the actor in him and kept the star away in a movie called Chak De India. In OSO, it&apos;s the opposite. OSO is a film where SRK can chill and not worry about the criticism. His performance is explosive and energetic. In this, it&apos;s SRK the superstar unleashed. And kudos to him for also poking fun at himself despite being the producer of this one.\n\nDeepika makes a grand debut and I&apos;m sure she couldn&apos;t have asked for anything else. She looks gorgeous and makes a good debut. Arjun Rampal is spectacular as the villain here. Brilliant.\n\nThe supporting cast does well too which includes the lovable Shreyas Talpade, the scene-stealing Kirron Kher and Javed Sheikh.\n\nOverall, A grand film which has one objective - Entertainment!",

      "reviewBody": "It &apos;s a big, sprawling movie about a Hispanic block in upper Manhattan&apos;s Washington Heights, and how each of them has his or her own dream, most of which are some variation of getting out of Washington Heights. It&apos;s a steady, dependable sort of multi-generational plot that was paying Fanny Hurst&apos;s bills more than a century ago, the stories and dreams seem well told, even if there are too may of them to keep in your head when we return to a particular character. It&apos;s also a musical, the one that Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote and directed and starred in to make his bones. John Chu has taken over the direction and Anthony Ramos the role.\n\nThere&apos;s some handsome, if not original choreography in this movie, bits lifted from WEST SIDE STORY and ROYAL WEDDING. It follows the tendency to make a big production number out of every dance. Until the next to last one, I experienced the despair I so often feel looking at modern movie musicals, convinced they&apos;ve forgotten how to move the camera, but instead cut, cut, cut. The last dance, however, showed they hadn&apos;t. They just would rather do a zip cut than plan out the complex movements.\n\nSigh. Still, the songs were surprisingly strong, particularly &quot;Paciencia Y Fe&quot;, sung by Olga Merediz. It&apos;s a skilled and enthusiastic cast, and it makes me hope that Hollywood will go back to making musicals, that are more than Broadway musicals filmed in front of a proscenium arch.",

Get another field of view .\n\nThe movie blends action , fun , humor , giggles , emotion , comedy, tongue-in-cheek and results to be quite funny and entertaining . Two protagonists carry out a dangerous assignment , their mission , to catch one of the world&apos;s most successful illegal arms dealers : using equal parts skill , action and humor . The characters from the TV series are reversed in this film version . As some roles have diffferent attitude , experience and personalities to the the original TV series. Eddie Murphy , as always , playing the same role , a foul-mouthed as well as sympathetic person , Owen Wilson and Famke Janssen are rightly portrayed . Support cast is pretty well , such as : Gary Cole , Malcolm McDowell, Phil Lewis, Leacock and Lynda Boyd . Good and atmospheric cinematography by Oliver Wood .

      "reviewBody": "The main characters are not always as interesting or well presented as  they should be, so its very hard to care about them that much. You kind  of know their particular plight, without them having to spell it out,  but some insight into each person might not have hurt too much. Each  character narrates a large part of their own story. However, the  director does a lot with the material to keep it lively. You get split  screens, backwards running film, slow motion, etc. and it fits the  subject perfectly.  Cameos are interesting, to say the least - its not every movie where  you get to see Fred Savage strung out, or see an insane  emergency room doctor. Eric Stoltz, Faye Dunaway and Swoozie Kurtz are  also aboard but don&apos;t stay around for too long.   The character Kip Pardue plays, Victor, gets a bit of a raw deal, as  he&apos;s seen in the beginning for a minute, then again at the end, when  you get a video diary, of sorts, of his escapades around Europe. In the  book he&apos;s handled differently. I like Kip, who played Sunshine in  &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; and was also in that stupid race car movie with  Sly Stallone and Burt Reynolds. I had a shrink hypnotize me so I&apos;d  forget the name of that one, but Kip was in it, that much I remember.   My favorite character by light years is Richard (sorry...he prefers  Dick, and loves saying it), who&apos;s a friend/lover of Paul (Ian  Somerhalder, who&apos;s great). Dick is in the movie for about ten minutes  but makes a lasting impression, dancing on a hotel bed with Paul to the  strains of George Michael&apos;s &quot;Faith&quot;, then having a hysterically funny  scene in the hotel w/Paul and their Moms. NO ONE in the movie is as  much fun as Dick, and I was a bit letdown when he exited. He seemed to  have a wild sense of humor about how screwed up he was.  I&apos;ve seen this about five times by now. I don&apos;t love it, and I have  some problems with some of the overkill, but I like it a lot. 7/10.",

Besides that, I feel the movie could have done better if Ayushmann Khurrana was in the lead instead, as he has more range of emotions and expressions which was required for the role. Shahid&apos;s acting was kind of forced, immature and he did not come across as a software engineer. The plot though unique was limited by its writing. There could have been more comedic twists and turns to make the movie more entertaining. Kirti Sanon was good as a robot and stole the limelight away from Shahid Kapoor who inadvertently took a back seat in the movie. The most painful aspect of the movie was watching my favorite He-man Dharamendra being reduced to a frail old man, all for a nondescript role which any Tom, Dick or Harry could have done. I hope he doesn&apos;t torture our memories with such roles in the future. Dimple Kapadia was adequate as the CEO of a Robotics company. On the technical side however you would have to question the viability of a robot 18 years in the making, which still has rudimentary issues such as inadequate battery life and inability to withstand simple power outages. All in all I would say inspite of it&apos;s inherent flaws the movie is Ok for a one time watch.",

      "reviewBody": "My mom and I have been trying to see more Johnny Depp movies since we saw his biography, we&apos;ve seen the main movies that highlighted his career, but never the little one&apos;s along the way. Don Juan DeMarco, I don&apos;t remember hearing much about it when it was released, I think it was one of those small success films. But the thing that was interesting is that so many people who compared Johnny Depp to Marlon Brando on his diverse roles and character acting methods, they finally got to work together in this movie and bonus, they had great chemistry on screen. Don Juan DeMarco isn&apos;t by any means my favorite Johnny Depp film or a great film, but it&apos;s a good one that I think had a decent story and is very watchable at least one time. Johnny and Marlon just deliver the story so well and were so charismatic on screen. Johnny truly became Don Juan DeMarco.\n\nDr. Jack Mickler is a psychiatrist who is on his last few days before his big retirement. He meets a suicidal man who is claiming that he is the legendary Don Juan DeMarco, he is put into the hospital. He begs Jack to take the time to tell him his story and that if he can convince him that he is Don Juan, that Jack will let him go. He agrees and Don tells him his story. But Don&apos;s grandmother tells Jack a different story, is Don really Don or just some crazy guy who is desperately in love with a woman? But Jack believes him and even becomes a Don Juan at home with his wife.\n\nDon Juan DeMarco is a cute film and is definitely worth a look. There&apos;s nothing wrong with the film, I just wasn&apos;t into it as much as I am usually thrilled with Johnny or Marlon. But I think this was one of those films they could be more relaxed with and they were already very much established as great actors, so they could do a movie like this. It didn&apos;t matter that it wasn&apos;t a box office success, it&apos;s just a cute movie that I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll enjoy. It definitely leaves a smile on your face and makes you feel good, so I would recommend it for a fun little comedy.\n\n7/10",

There was nothing creative or original about this movie.\n\nYou know that feeling where you see an actor/actress in a certain role and then you see them in another movie and it&apos;s like they were told to keep the same character but the film&apos;s setting is so completely different and all you can think is &apos;no, this is wrong, this just doesn&apos;t work&apos;. It&apos;s exactly what I thought while watching this film but instead of the character(s) being wrong it felt like the whole movie was wrong.\n\nI would have even accepted it if the only thing they kept was the basic concept and redesigned the rest from scratch.

This movie is just awful! The plot is cliche, uninteresting, with some predictable scenes and the worst action sequences I&apos;ve seen in a movie with a &quot;big&quot; budget (seriously, even my grandmother without any knowledge about cinema could film better those fight scenes of Lisbeth fighting the bad guys in some bathrooms). The cast is so weak, Claire Foy is a good actress and she tries to do her best with her poorly developed character, but stills the weakest Lisbeth Salander. They&apos;re not bad actors, but all of them seem to be in this movie by obligation.\n\nI can&apos;t say I&apos;m disappointed because my expectations were already low, I&apos;m just a little sad because it could be an awesome film if Sony had chosen a more appropriate director and better screenwriters.\n\nRating 3.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Coming off the highest grossing entry in the Nightmare series, part 4, it was going to be tough to follow-up. In director Hopkins&apos;s defense, I applaud him for going in a different direction, despite not making a, well, killing at the box office.\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child brings Freddy back mostly to the dark and &quot;scary&quot; path he once took. Sure there were some funny moments and lines from Freddy (you could probably cut the humor/quotes from #4 down to a 1/3), but for the most part, they made a darker less comedic nightmare than #4.\n\nAlice returns from #4, actually her, her father and her boyfriend Dan, all the surviving members of #4. Surprise, Freddy&apos;s back, but Alice doesn&apos;t know how (yet) that he&apos;s all around her when she&apos;s awake. And she&apos;s out of control from her dreams.\n\nOf course, she has a new slate of friends, or victims, and Freddy&apos;s getting them one by one in a tad bit creative ways. (Only one really stands out – Superfreddy, and the rest ho-hum, comparatively speaking to the first entries in the series.) He&apos;s using Alice&apos;s (and Dan&apos;s) unborn child, somehow and Alice and gang must both believe in the man of their dreams before they&apos;re all bumped off.\n\nThough this wasn&apos;t the worst in the series, by far, it was still a throwaway. Not a must-see in the long franchise. Take the bland friends, or make that boring with barely a pulse for Freddy to stop. Or the copied plot from #3. Or the retreaded Alice from #4.\n\nBut the score is good, I liked the atmosphere – dark and strange, especially the tongue-in-cheek finale, and I liked some of Freddy&apos;s moments. It&apos;s worth a viewing, for fans only. But not repeat viewings.\n\nSide Note: When I was about 14-15, a friend of mine from Illinois, who used to live with me here in Phoenix, AZ, sent me a gift once. He wouldn&apos;t tell me what it was, but I was stoked when I saw a huge, flat cardboard box. It already gave away the contents inside – something about Freddy. Inside was a stand-up, cardboard clip out – 6&apos; tall of Freddy, the baby carriage – it was an ad for the video release of Nightmare 5. I loved that and still have that, roughly 20 years later, even the box it came in. Funniest thing is, and I&apos;ve heard Robert Englund comment on this, the photo they used was transposed, whereas Freddy&apos;s glove appears to be on his left hand when it&apos;s always on his right. Oh, well, that just makes it all the more valuable to me.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Dressed To Kill&apos; was Brian De Palma&apos;s third Hitchcockian thriller, and his most successful. I don&apos;t necessarily mean artistically successful, but it still remains one of his best known movies, and is the one on which his reputation as &quot;that Hitchcock&quot; guy mainly rests on. De Palma has made all kinds of movies in his long career but it says a lot for the impact &apos;Dressed To Kill&apos; had on audiences for him to be stereotyped like that by many movie lovers. In &apos;Sisters&apos; De Palma paid tribute to &apos;Rear Window&apos;, in his underrated &apos;Obsession&apos; it was &apos;Vertigo&apos;, and this time around &apos;Psycho&apos; is the major inspiration. Some critics of De Palma complain he is more interested in style over substance, and in &apos;Dressed To Kill&apos; there is some truth in that. You will probably guess the murderer after the first 20-25 minutes, then think to yourself &quot;no, that&apos;s just a red herring and there will be an unexpected twist later on&quot;. You might then be a bit let down when the your initial guess turns out to be correct after all, but there are enough thrills and dazzling sequences throughout to keep most thriller fans happy. Michael Caine and Angie Dickinson are both pretty good in their respective roles, but Nancy Allen (&apos;RoboCop&apos;) gives the real outstanding performance in the picture. De Palma would subsequently give her another good role in &apos;Blow Out&apos; opposite John Travolta. Also strong are Keith Gordon (who went on to star in John Carpenter&apos;s &apos;Christine&apos;) and Dennis Franz (&apos;NYPD Blue&apos;) in supporting roles. Personally I don&apos;t think &apos;Dressed To Kill&apos; is as good as &apos;Sisters&apos;, but I still think it&apos;s first rate exploitation thriller and definitely worth watching. Not De Palma&apos;s most interesting movie by a long shot, but still one of his most watchable."

Why doesn&apos;t Tom Noonan initially keep their appointment, why does a knife slash from the level of someone lying down hit a large standing guy in the throat, why does it upset me that so much of a horror movie is utterly nonsensical and the heroes&apos; actions are that of a blithering moron who has never seen a horror movie or been scared for a second in her life (well, that one&apos;s easy to answer - it&apos;s because it is incredibly lazy writing), why does it annoy me that so many horror fans think that this is something they need to settle for ?? No doubt the film-maker would say this is a pastiche of 1980&apos;s horror movies, and as such was MEANT to be bad, but the cynical part of me wants to say that until I&apos;ve seen better from this film-maker, pastiches of bad 1980&apos;s horrors is where he should stay.",

      "name": "Will Ferrell like you&apos;ve never seen him before: Not kicking or screaming",
      "reviewBody": "¨Do you know what the rate of success is for marriage when one person sobers up, but the other one doesn&apos;t?¨\n\nWill Ferrell stars in this fantastic comedy slash drama, but this isn&apos;t the typical Ferrell comedy where we see him screaming all over the screen. This time he plays a quiet and sad alcoholic, and it&apos;s perhaps one of his best performances to date. Everything Must Go was a really pleasant surprise for me; it reminded me a lot of 2008&apos;s film The Visitor starring Richard Jenkins. Will Ferrell gives a very similar and quiet performance. Nothing really happens in the movie, but it&apos;s the relationship between the characters that carries the film to a higher ground. This is Dan Rush&apos;s first film as a director, and he really hits a home run with his debut film. He also adapted the screenplay from Raymond Carver&apos;s short story ¨Why Don&apos;t You Dance.¨ The dialogue in this movie is just great, and it really feels authentic. The actors also do a great job with the pauses; everything about this movie makes it fresh. The film is rather slow paced and focuses more on the drama and interactions between characters who end up bonding in unexpected ways. It also has very funny moments; although not the laugh out loud kind of humor, but more of a put a grind on your face kind of comedy. I didn&apos;t know Ferrell had it in him to give a performance of this caliber without relying on his usual loud mouth role. This is the sort of guy we can identify with, and whose life seems to be unraveling right in front of us. So much potential gone down the drain due to a small mistake. \n\nWill Ferrell plays a Sales Executive named Nick Halsey who at the beginning of the film is being fired from his job due to his problems with alcohol. He was a great worker, and seemed to be recovering from his drinking problem, but recently had a relapse when he traveled to Denver and decided to have a few drinks to celebrate an important sale. Word got out to the office in Arizona and they decided it was time to let Nick go. Without a job, now Nick arrives home only to discover that all his things are laying in the front yard of his house and his wife has changed the locks of the doors. Apparently in Denver he also slept with another woman and now his wife has kicked him out of the house. Nick decides to stay in his front yard sitting on his reclining chair and has no intention of moving out. Someone makes a complain and the police come to arrest him for disturbing the peace in the neighborhood, but his friend, Detective Frank Garcia (Michael Peña), gets him a permit to stay in his front lawn for five days with the excuse that he is having a garage sale. During these days he befriends a young boy named Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) who practically spends all day on his own. Nick hires him to help out with the sale and during that time they become friends. Nick teaches Kenny a thing or two about baseball. A new neighbor also has recently moved in the house in front of Nick&apos;s; she introduces herself as Samantha (Rebecca Hall) and says she&apos;s expecting a baby girl in a couple of months. Nick opens up to her about his problems and they being an interesting friendship. \n\nEverything Must Go is a really interesting small film that will surely put a smile on your face as we see these authentic interactions between characters that probably under normal circumstances never would&apos;ve befriended each other. The thing I enjoyed the most about this film was the realistic way in which each of these characters was portrayed; and the way the actors played them. Will Ferrell, Christopher Wallace, and Rebecca Hall (who I first came to love in Ben Affleck&apos;s flick The Town) all give great performances and the success of the film relies entirely on them. The movie isn&apos;t deep, it doesn&apos;t try to be preachy either; it just focuses on these small relationships and lets us now that it&apos;s never too late to start again. Will Ferrell should continue to accept interesting projects like this so he can prove that he is more than a one dimensional actor. I love his comedies, like Talladega Nights and Ron Burgundy, but it is great to see him in different roles as well proving he can be a serious actor as well. Director, Dan Rush took a huge risk by giving him the lead role, but the gamble paid off because he fit the role perfectly. This is a different kind of film, but I absolutely recommend it. I loved it.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "Brilliant!  Kenneth Branagh&apos;s version of the timeless William Shakespeare classic is a great rendition of the film, making it accessible to everyone, even those who do not like Shakespeare.\n\nLet me first say that I am a great fan of Shakespeare&apos;s works.  In college I was an English literature major, with a minor in theater, and so Shakespeare is found in both.  Theater people state that Shakespeare was never literature at all, which in the purpose of the plays is true, however because of the prose that he wrote in is a poetic form, he is literature as well.  Whatever you do, never get in between two people arguing this point, your head might blow up!\n\nReading the comments on this page, the basic attack on this movie is that Branagh cuts lines and shaved parts.  Yes, of course he did.  Nothing is sacred, not even the works of Shakespeare, people.  I myself was in a Shakespeare play, and over half the script was cut from it.  With a Shakespeare play, the question is what to cut.  If this play had been presented in it&apos;s entirety, it would have been close to five hours long. And today&apos;s movie audience just does not have that kind of patience.  &quot;Titanic&quot; was stretching it a little, in terms of time.  Shakespeare&apos;s original audience would have had no problem, because they made a day of it.\n\nSo when Branagh did this play, he had to shave off a great deal of the script, and he had to decide what to focus on.  He had to focus on the main characters, being Beatrice and Benedict and their romance, and of course the drama concerning Hero and Claudio, but also keep other characters incorporated as well.  For those attacking the &quot;whittling down&quot; of the script, why didn&apos;t anyone bring up the point that Benedict is supposed to have shaved his beard while in attempt to woo Beatrice.  Why?  Because it really isn&apos;t a major plot point that is needed at all.  So Branagh made great choices in his direction of the film, and in the end he made sure that everything tied together logically, and that there were no loose ends.\n\nThe performances by the actors were great as well.  There was nothing wrong with casting Denzel Washington as the prince, though people seem to have a beef with it.  He pulled it off very well.  And Keanu Reeves did a great job as well.  It was a treat to see him as a villain.  I happen to be a fan of Reeves, and I do see him as great casting, though why people also have a problem with him I&apos;ll never know.  Branagh was going for acting ability, not just names.  Reeves has the goods, and he can speak Shakespeare very well, it&apos;s his character that&apos;s supposed to be moody.  And Keaton was a wonderful choice for the Constable, making me laugh whenever he was on the screen. And the other actors all did very well in their roles.\n\nIf you&apos;re a lover of Shakespeare or not, this film is a great treat, and it appeals to all audiences who love the classic masterpiece.",

There&apos;s a fine line between horror and annoyance, and the difference is evident between the original film and this sequel. The first had some great character development, witty dialogue, an intriguing plot. All of those things have been substituted for B-movie versions of same. Huge plot holes, impossible scenarios, expositional dialogue, and an ending that makes both films seem pointless.

      "reviewBody": "This film is terrible.  I really can&apos;t understand why they changed Krueger from a mass murdering scary figure to a Jerry Lewis clone.  They should have given the role of Krueger to Robin Williams.  At least he is good at comedy. That would be something I would pay to see.  I have seen the first Nightmare about 50 times, I have seen Craven&apos;s last one maybe 5 times, the others are just a waste of time and they are not even worth one viewing.  I can&apos;t tell you how much I despise the way that horror films have evolved. From all of the Fridays after the fourth, all the Nightmares after the first and before the last and all the Scream clones, they are mostly terrible. There have really only been perhaps 3 films in the 90&apos;s that scared me.  One was Wes&apos; New Nightmare and the two others are this summer&apos;s biggest surprises, that being The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth Sense.  They are movies that scare, chill and make you jump in ways that this and every other Nightmare could only dream of.  If you have a morbid curiosity of what else I think of this film, review A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre along with the other two films that I mentioned.  Then you will see that those films are the exact opposite of what this one if.  And that is a scary thought.  I just hope that horror films are on the rise again seeing as we now have names like Myrick, Sanchez and Shyalaman that have emerged onto the scene.  Perhaps they can bring us back to what horror films used to stand for.  We used to have scares and chills, now we have comedy in place of all that is a horror movie.  If that is your thing then watch this one along with movies like Idle Hands.  But if you are a purist, stay away from this one and go rent some classics.  Thank the movie Gods for video.  \n\nTo sum it up, in case you didn&apos;t get it, this is a disgrace to what Freddy originally stood for.  This is a terrible horror movie."

Then came a similarly themed Bird Box on Netflix and I thought that was OK and watchable, Now comes The Silence, A Quiet Place wannabe that just doesn&apos;t have the oomph or pinache of the original. It had some good moments but were too few and far between. One problem I had with both A Quiet Place and The Silence is the premise that humans are too inept and powerless to keep from becoming prey/food for the creatures. They&apos;re attracted to sound so why not set up some humongous speakers and amps in an empty stadium or city, crank it up and get all those suckers to gather there, then have an an F-22 drop a tactical nuke on them and blow them all to kingdom come. Hell, they did that to the aliens in Alien vs Predator:Requiem. They can do that in these movies too.",

Then it somehow became &apos;Fight Club&apos; with women, and finished up as a film I had never seen before. This was a journey.\n\nThe film is done in quite a bizarre way. It&apos;s set in the present but everyone dresses like the 70s and there are no smart phones. Also there are almost no adults in the film and the few that there are are absolute monsters. If there&apos;s a school assembly the students are just running it, for example. You get used to it after a while but I can&apos;t remember another film like it in that sense.\n\nThe film is at its best when it is just trying to be wacky and funny. There&apos;s a period in the middle where some conflict arrises and the film gets bogged down briefly. Which is a shame because when the film is trying to be funny it is genuinely funny. There is some great dialogue in this film. I had a good time. 8/10.",

It&apos;s basically about a dog that gets rabies, and a mother and her son are trapped in the middle of nowhere (in their car that broke down, of all things) because the dog is terrorizing them. It&apos;s really pretty sad actually, because they show the dog chasing the rabbit into the cave where he gets the rabies, and the dog just seems so sweet and cute. It&apos;s pretty scary too, when the boy passes out from the heat in the car and needs water or SOMETHING. It obviously set that kind of situation for movies like Panic Room and Signs. It is really a pretty suspenseful movie with that psychological terror--it would scare the hell out of you if it happened to you."

      "reviewBody": "If you liked the first season of JJK, you&apos;ll probably like this movie. If you didn&apos;t like the first season of JJK, there&apos;s probably nothing here to convince you otherwise. That being said from some of the greatest animation studios MAPPA and Toho ,this movie raises the bar in many aspects during its runtime ,from the epic battles to the amazing soundtrack to some amazing heartwarming stories and cool characters with abilities that will melt your eyes out. A well-told story and neatly wrapped up by the time the credits role. It helps flesh out some of the backstory for Geto, one of the series&apos; main antagonists, and of course Yuta, who reappears in the manga at a later date, but is by no means mandatory viewing to enjoy the rest of JJK.\n\nOne thing the film easily surpasses the original season with is the emotional moments. Connecting with the characters and their struggles seem much more real and causes much greater immersion. The less extreme personality of the main character, great music choice, and fluid animation make even the slow scenes feel meaningful. The story teaches us the what is love ,how it can be a curse and a power at the same time. All the characters have a deep effect on the progression of the story even though Yuta&apos;s development in the span of 1:45 minutes comes a bit fast it&apos;s still extremely satisfying seeing him grow.\n\nThe art and animation are a 10/10. Mappa doesn&apos;t fail to amaze me in everything they do.\n\nComplimenting the great animation is the music. Each part of the OST accentuates the emotion of the scenes and really brings up the hype during the battle scenes.\n\nOverall the movie is amazing and one of my all time favourites. If you haven&apos;t seen Jujutsu Kaisen then you might want to watch this film since this is a prequel to the main series. Don&apos;t even think before watching this, just do it. I honestly prefer the manga, but this was almost just as good and makes me anticipate S2 even more.",

      "reviewBody": "Flight of the Navigator is directed by Randal Kleiser and is adapted to screenplay by Michael Burton and Matt MacManus from a story by Mark H. Baker. It stars Joey Cramer, Veronica Cartwright, Cliff De Young, Sarah Jessica Parker, Howard Hesseman and the voice of Paul Reubens. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography is by James Glennon and Eric McGraw.\n\nYoung David Freeman (Cramer) is out in the woods near his home in Fort Lauderdale when he falls down a ravine and is knocked unconscious. Waking up he finds that the world around him has advanced by 8 years but he hasn&apos;t. After being reunited with his overjoyed parents, it becomes apparent that David has had an encounter with a extra terrestrial life form, which of course greatly interests the authorities...\n\nIt&apos;s a family friendly sci-fi with a difference, in that it doesn&apos;t have to take us into space for its tale, yet this in no way detracts from how enjoyable Flight of the Navigator is. It is told from young David&apos;s perspective (with Cramer impressionable), thus it firmly engages the kids in the audience. The relationship between David and the Phaleon computer system (Reubens) engages with witty chatter and educational purpose, and the effects work should not be taken for granted either. If we are to be picky then the build up is a touch long before the pic goes &quot;extra terrestrial&quot;, and Cartwright and De Young are barely given time to impact as parents coming to terms with a family life turned upside down. But small complaints really and this is a lovely film, one that isn&apos;t just for 1980s nostalgists. 7/10",

I cannot imagine the wager that fine actors like Gary Oldman and Carla Gugino must have lost to get them to appear in this poo, but it must have been a big one.\n\nHurrah! There were some good things.\n\nSome of the twisted body imagery was quite effective. (It was effective when it first appeared in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, twenty six years ago.) Also, Megan Fox lookalike Odette Yustman looked quite nice in her underwear.\n\nBoo! There were many more bad things.\n\nA predictable plot, cobbled together from a million other direct-to-video movies. No tension or scares whatsoever, with every story twist sign posted miles ahead. Awful acting, of course, with &apos;best friend&apos; Meagan Good being top of the list of shame. Slow, boring, terrible.\n\nI thought that &quot;The Unborn&quot; was absolutely dreadful. A rotten film.\n\nAvoid.",

      "reviewBody": "Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key) is a conservative suburbanite with a wife and child. His cousin, Rell (Jordan Peele), is a bong-smoking slacker. Then one day Rell finds a kitten on his doorstep and immediately takes it in. He names the kitten Keanu. A few weeks later, in a case of mistaken identity, members of the Blips drug gang break into his house, ransack it and take Keanu. Rell and Clarence set off into Blips territory to recover Keanu.\n\nOnly watched this because it stars Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. Loved their comedy show, Key and Peele, and a full-length comedy feature film starring them sounded promising.\n\nThe movie certainly retains much of the trademark Key and Peele humour. Add in an absurd-yet-fun plot and a cute kitten and you have a good comedy movie. Some great scenes and lines. Key and Peele are in fine form in the lead roles, with spot-on delivery and the wonderful comedic chemistry that their TV show demonstrated.\n\nNot brilliant though. As with many transitions from TV to film, the momentum and ideas seem to diminish as the movie goes on - the core plot line proves difficult to sustain for 90+ minutes. The comedy is still there, but the movie becomes more uneven the further into it you go. Some pretty weak scenes towards the end. The plot becomes quite haphazard and farcical.\n\nOverall, however, Keanu is good fun and well worth watching.",

Many of the comical situations do happen in real life and it really gets to you when you see it from outside.\n\nThe main plot may be a little exaggerated, how everything comes together but it&apos;s a classic date movie and you cannot have such high expectations from it.\n\nThe cast is OK, even though Jennifer Lopez is a little overpowered by her role, but she manages in the end to pull it of. Alex O&apos;Loughlin is the perfect &quot;I don&apos;t know if I want to be a father but I love this woman&quot; guy and makes every moment a real delight.\n\nEveryone gives it a 4 or 5, I give it an 8 because you can have a blast if you watch it with your girlfriend or ex.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1692, in the Ipswich Colony of Massachusetts, five families of powerful witches commit to a covenant of silence to protect themselves against the witch hunters, but one of the families transgress their pact and is banished from their lands. Along the centuries, the power and the covenant are transmitted through their descendants and when the eldest son is eighteen years old, he ascends to a higher power. However, the use of magic addicts and if used in excess, ages the warlock. In the present days, four wizards teenage friends are in high school and their leader Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait) is close to his eighteenth birthday and consequently to ascend. He has just met Sarah Wenham (Laura Ramsey) and they are dating, when the appearance of darkling and supernatural dreams haunt the group. Sooner they find an evil warlock, descendant of the fifth ancient family that wants to strip Caleb&apos;s power.\n\nI liked &quot;The Covenant&quot;, a supernatural teenager movie in the style of &quot;Angel&quot;, Buffy&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot; or &quot;Supernatural&quot;. This film has good special effects, but the story and characters are not well-developed and some lines are terrible. The acting is only reasonable, but Laura Ramsey is extremely beautiful and natural in her great performance, and I liked this unknown actress. In the end, I found &quot;The Covenant&quot; very entertaining, but could be better and better with minor improvements in the screenplay. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Pacto&quot; (&quot;The Covenant&quot;)",

Interestlingly the unit comes across a website of a creep who broadcasts live torture and killings of hostage victims in various grisly ways live over the internet. The bloody catch is the more the web surfer logs onto the sick website, the faster and quicker the victims will die in the various forms of bleed outs, fried by hot mirrors, or seasoned by sulfuric acid. The drama only gets more interesting when the computer of Jennifer is hacked into by the sicko setting up for a dramatic finish and showdown encounter. Lane gives a fine performance as a serious investigative agent, and yet no matter how grisly that many scenes are the theme of net crime and hacking overpowers and gives a strong message of awareness even over the well liked and popcorn moments of torture and nasty horror. Overall &quot;Untraceable&quot; is not a bad flick nothing great, yet it&apos;s enjoyable and does hold interest by making us aware of the web crime and hacking identity problem.",

It starts with a very creepy setup and manages through most of the Film to keep that sense of Impending Doom with its Supernatural and Apocalyptic tone.\n\nThe use of Ancient Texts and Religious language Prophecy is introduced but somewhat abandon as things unfold, giving way to more conventional displays of Zombie like Characterizations and Gore Movie conventions. When a Text translation is rendered on a computer screen... the goosebumps arise. \n\nThe scariness is lessened by the end of it all as the Director veers away from the unseen Evil and things get a bit standard. Such as some unnecessary attempts at humor and a denouement that is a reflection of a weak wrap-up. One more item...hopefully, it should be clear by now that Sci-Fi Writers should completely avoid using specific dates in their Stories. It is a Death Trap, because as you discover here, the Dream induced message is coming from the year 1999. Oops!",

I met &quot;these&quot; people over the last 25 years in Bucharest and in Germany.\n\nIn this &quot;new global world&quot;, the most of the time everybody is so deep into the details of &quot;knowing how to be&quot; because everybody is already like this, that if you take a step back and watch from a different angle you might wonder if anyone still remembers what it is to be a human. To remember the pleasure of feeling secure and loved by the ones that are guaranteed to be the ones that will do so. And finally if you get the right angle, you have to admit that everyone around you looks ridiculously, trying to find the detail in the detail that would make a difference, even if everybody does everything identically and there is obviously nothing else. The game about being a tough global business-woman/man, up to the most disgusting proofs to be the tougher one, is finally just flat and meaningless.\n\nThe whole story is wonderful true. The actors are doing a fantastic job making you feel the frustration and discomfort that should be seen and felt by everyone living in such a world. It is not a slow movie ... it is the shortest version of an never-ending slow life with nothing that would make your heart pound for the true meanings.\n\nThis movie brought two points to my mind. Einstein defined madness: - Trying the same thing again and again while expecting a different outcome. - Google was build on the simple idea that everybody is searching for something that everybody is already mentioning... Try to type &quot;Apple&quot; in the Google search field",

      "reviewBody": "Hollywood loves to remake foreign language films and it&apos;s at it again with an Argentinian film that was made only six years ago. The Secret in Their Eyes received the Best Foreign Language Oscar but there&apos;s no chance for this production to be even nominated in any Oscar categories. I haven&apos;t seen the original so I can&apos;t compare the two movies but knowing Hollywood&apos;s track record with remakes, the Argentinian version would have been a superior production.\n\nIn 2002, a team of FBI investigators including Ray (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Jess (Julia Roberts) along with a newly arrived district attorney, Claire (Nicole Kidman), are based in Los Angeles to prevent terrorists from inflicting more damage to the American way of life after 9/11 the previous year. The agency receives a call about an incident that has taken place in the vicinity of a mosque. Thinking this is terror-related they make the grim discovery of a murdered young lady who just so happens to be Jess&apos; daughter, Carolyn (Zoe Graham). The agents make an arrest but the man is released as he is a snitch for the FBI, providing names of terrorists to the organization. For 13 years, Ray logs onto the criminal database and eventually finds the man who might have been responsible for Carolyn&apos;s death. Will justice be served after 13 years?\n\nThe main problem with the story is the ridiculous number of flashbacks throughout the whole film. There are even flashbacks within flashbacks. The flow of the narrative is constantly interrupted and there are occasions where you have to think when the story is being set. As for the story itself, it is rather lacking in thrills which takes away the dramatic impact of the whole situation. This is rarely edge of your seat material which is a shame as the story should lend itself to a tense and dramatic thriller. \n\nWhat the story does well is provide character interactions and depict why people act and behave the way they do. If you are after a character study then you will be happier with the development of the story. For characterizations to excel you need actors who you can empathize with. Ejiofor is the main star and he performs with distinction while Roberts doesn&apos;t have as many scenes but she is excellent in conveying her emotions. Kidman is overshadowed by her counterparts but still manages to bring her character to life. Dean Norris as FBI agent Bumpy Willis brings some humor to his role, ensuring that the tone of the story isn&apos;t dour for the whole film. Alfred Molina has several scene- stealing scenes as District Attorney Martin Morales.\n\nA movie with two Oscar winning actresses and an Oscar nominated actor should have been better than this. Here is a definite case of the trailer being more exciting than the film itself. The final product only provides a fraction of what the intriguing premise had to offer.  http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review",

Unfortunately, I think this is the most correct direction to take since season 4 and 5 of The Witcher with the change of actor in the leading role makes us glimpse a resounding failure.",

      "reviewBody": "Ever since I was a kid, I loved fantasy movies. As a matter of fact, anything with sword fights was great in my book. And since I grew up in the days before Lord of the Rings came along, my favourites were always mid-to-late-eighties fantasy epics like The Princess Bride, Willow, and Ladyhawke.\n\nIt&apos;s all about an outcast knight and his lover, who have been cursed by an evil bishop to become animals during night and day, so they&apos;re never together in human form. He becomes a wolf and she becomes a hawk (hence the title). The knight enlists the help of a young thief to break into the cathedral and take his revenge on the bishop. Aside from the basic premise, it&apos;s more of a historical movie than a fantasy movie. There&apos;s no magic other than the curse, and no trolls or giants or anything, which was partly the reason I enjoyed it so much.\n\nI&apos;ve also always loved this movie for it&apos;s great storyline and interesting characters. Philipe&apos;s conversations with God still amuse me, as does the drunken monk played by Leo McKern ... It comes from director Richard Donner, who of course brought us Superman I &amp; II, the Lethal Weapon movies and so on. This is essentially a well-directed movie, although a lot of people have issues with the choice of soundtrack. It&apos;s kind of a techno-poppy thing, which I blame NeverEnding Story for. A lot of eighties fantasy movies went with the same idea, but it works with Ladyhawke better than it works with most others, although I would of course prefer a more conventional and less intrusive score. On the whole, the sets and the props are pretty convincing, although some of the fight sequences aren&apos;t particularly great.\n\nHere we have an early Matthew Broderick performance which shows how little his acting skills have developed since. Not that he&apos;s a bad actor, just an early bloomer I guess. Cult icon Rutger Hauer, of whom I have always been a huge fan (Blade Runner, The Hitcher, The 10th Kingdom) gives a fantastic performance as the outcast knight, and as we all know it&apos;s never a bad idea to have Michelle Pfeiffer in a movie.\n\nYou should definitely see this movie if you&apos;re a fan of the genre, or of any of the actors involved. It&apos;s a wonderful fantasy adventure for all ages.",

This is a Neo Noir movie which happens rarely in Tamil. \n\nStory is simple straight forward police and gangster cat and mouse or I could say hide seek game. \n\nThe wow factor is the screenplay which is well crafted and characterisations are well etched. The perfect pace stands out first kept the audience thrilled and guessing till the end. Dialogues are sharp as knife and powerful as the gun shots in the movie. The BGM was rock solid which had added the feel to the play. \n\nComing to the performances Madhavan as Vikram the protagonist a perfect police maintains his grip and emotes intensive emotions particularly when he feels he was used. Vijay Sethupathy on the other hand essays antagonist Vedha a most wanted leader of local gang pulling it off effortlessly seriously effortlessly like so much of assaultness the way he carries himself stands out unique particularly. Loved the in between short stories he threw. Both Madhavan and VJS with their exposed grey carried on their roles picture perfect. They present raw psychological thriller duo. All the other support characters were picked perfect. Varalakshmi&apos;s plays an extended cameo but stands out as well the new face lady who plays the lawyer and wife of Vikram. \n\nSubtle messages on guilt - revenge - emotions of gangster or the police were the special catch. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed watching this Neo-Noir flick. \n\nVerdict : Don&apos;t miss it. Hats off to the team Vikram Vedha. Easy 8.5 on 10",

      "name": "A down to earth character driven film that benefits from its colourful characters and clever use of the real people themselves",
      "reviewBody": "Harvey Pekar is a filing clerk at his local hospital; he is miserable; he is on his way out of a second terrible marriage and his only interests are collecting second hand records, reading and listening to jazz. However a chance meeting with aspiring cartoonist Robert Crumb turns him on to the ability of comic books as an art form. Crumbs later success inspires Harvey to write a different type of comic  one based on his own life, chronicling the dreary and absurd moments of his days and life. As his down to earth portrayal of working class reality starts to generate a cult following, Harvey finds a new wife and greater fame  but actual happiness? Well, that&apos;s a different story.\n\nI have never read any of Pekar&apos;s comics and, to be honest, have little interest in the world of comics because I am consistently put off by the price of them for what you get (I&apos;m a Batman fan but local prices for very thin comics are too high for me to start it as a habit). Despite this I was attracted to this film by it being different and offering me an interesting choice of leading man in Giamatti, but, given the very non-blockbuster appeal of the film, it was barely had any time in my local cinema and I missed it there and had to catch it on DVD. When I sat to watch it I was immediately taken in by the design of the film  the comic book opening and, more importantly, the narration and candid footage of the real Pekar (and others). This gives the film a much more interesting appeal because, although we don&apos;t know him, we get the total feeling that this is a real person we are seeing  and indeed he is.\n\nNot having read the comic itself I can only go off what the film and other reviewers have told me they are like and, from that understanding, I feel that the film is stronger for having basically the same strengths as the comic. That is to say, it is very down to earth and gritty, without sparkling scenes or flowery dialogue but with a simple wit to the weird collection of characters. This warts and all presentation is moved forward by a pretty good narration from Pekar but the ultimate strength of the film is its collection of characters  like the comic, they are the story of Pekar&apos;s life and they are the heart of the film. It is hard to describe but the collection of bitterness, psychosis&apos;s, nerds and other weirdoes makes for a good film that is interesting, humorous and, most effectively, true.\n\nGiamatti is not leading man material but here he shows that he is more that the comic relief and he delivers a really good performance throughout  not even letting the presence of the real Pekar put him off his stride. Pekar himself is also good  very easy to listen to but also unhappy and not the sort of person you talk to at work. The support cast is also pretty strong and features all manner of minor characters that make the film add up to greater than the sum of its parts. Like I said, it is hard to pigeonhole this film and the cast but it seems to work and even people who have never heard of Pekar (ie  me) will be able to enjoy it.\n\nOverall a very different film about a strange little man who managed to get much more success than he ever though possible but yet never let it change his unhappy and normal ways. It is amusing, cleverly structured and populated with ordinary weirdoes who make it fun to watch. Kudo to the director for getting the uninitiated into the film with such ease and managing to produce a film that is surprisingly weird to find in a multiplex but one that is strangely accessible to most people."

The two male friends fall in love with the enticing executive, creating themselves a loving triangle. Jake is in a traditional congregation that want him married with a good Jewish woman but is the fact which his mother(Anne Bancroft) disapproved to his brother for marrying with a non Jewish .Jake is a little worried about his future and he&apos;s out step,out of place and desperately looking for a fiancée with numerous suitors(Rena Sofer) The problems are when Brian cannot break his vow of celibacy and Jake cannot marry but isn&apos;t Jewish . We never met a pair as liking as Stiller and Norton.They along with Jenna Elfman are agreeable,enticing and enjoyable.The film has great load of amusement,fun,giggles,chuckles and is very entertained.Besides there are a brief exploration about Jewish way of life, making a slight exposition of the rites ,ceremonies ,habits, religion and the Tora .Although the screenplay sounds some ridiculous and absurd ,the plot is well developed and has surprises and its good moments here and there. Nice and cheerful music score by the classic Elmer Berstein(Seven magnificent,Age of innocence).Direction by Edward Norton captures the special excitement or mood protagonists and scenarios. The flick will like to romantic comedy enthusiastic. Rating: Nice and Well worth watching.",

What happens here is a perfectly decent movie gets so hyped you are always going to be disappointed because it cannot possibly live up to that hyped reviewers drivel. Its a smart, clever movie that takes a while to get going, has a lot of padding and is not in any way a real horror film. It most certainly isnt &quot;the scariest film of the decade&quot; or whever that nonsense said. The lead is very good as is almost all the cast - pointless as some of them were. I liked the ending, thoiugh it was a little predictable. As an exploration of religious fervour in the wrong mind and the damage that can do, it certainly succeeds but if you are expecting the exorcist or anything like it, you will be disappointed. This is yet another example of critics trying to show how clever they are and at the same time, causing the movie to disappoint movie goers who, had they ignored those critics would probably have said, yeah, that was pretty good that - which is pretty much all it is. Scarborough is gorgeous as always though. if you&apos;ve nebver been you should, quintessential English holiday spot.",

      "reviewBody": "He got game is an exceptional story about a basketball player who quarrels with family issues and strives towards his dream. Directed by Spike Lee, this movie takes an in depth look at exactly how many variables are involved when being the MVP, and how a man can grow up and assess these circumstances.\n\nRay Allen plays a character who&apos;s name is Jesus Shuttlesworth. At a young age, his father pressed him dramatically to be the best he could be. However by mistake kills Jesus&apos;s mother and is sent to prison. The troubled child eventually grows up to become one for the best players in the nation. Now the drama builds up. When the decision to go pro or join a college team is just around the corner, Jesus&apos;s father (played by Denzel Washington) is let out of jail to convert his son to a specific school or else the father is returned to jail, it leaves Jesus with a daunting task. The reconcile between the father and son is what eventually allows Jesus to become a real man and face his problems.\n\nThe idea that a boy cannot live without his father plays a defined role in this movie. Jesus grows up with the responsibilities of taking care of his sister, who is several years younger than he is. While it appears that Jesus has all of the support in the world, Spike Lee does a terrific job of accentuating how they are really leeches. All the people want are money, fame, and fortune; which is all possible through Jesus. The reason the father plays such a key role is because although he needs Jesus&apos;s help, he isn&apos;t interested in that. He really loves his son.\n\nAlthough Spike Lee did some amazing work with this movie especially with the inner city sequences, as well as the use of colors and poetry to his advantage for getting his ideas across to the audience, several scenes were unneeded which seemed overly explicit. Although these are truly issues that can ruin a famous person, they seemed almost too graphic to be seen by a general audience. What Spike does so well is keeping the real connections with the street, and enabling the audience to see exactly what the character is going through by using several techniques. \n\nColors in the movie such as red, green, and black symbolize power, pain, and respect between different characters. While Jesus hates his name, his father named him that through a basketball player that was how he put it, &quot;the truth.&quot; This movie proves that in real life, you can benefit more by forgiving, and not forgetting.\n\nOverall I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a unique, intellectual film that will make you think about your present situation, as well as allowing you to know the difficulties that come with fame.",

What really stands out once again is the extremely intense and gruesome scenery. With technological advances in CGI and practical effects they&apos;re able to portray much more in the hellish atmosphere. Director Bruckner once again shows a sleek style in his shot composition and ideals that really set a grim tone. Overall a very solid Reimagination that somewhat impressed me.",

They&apos;re forced to become friends and rely on one another in order to survive. The enemies, earthman and reptilian alien survive on hostile world facing enslavers foes(usual nasty Brion James).\n\nThis warmhearted Sci-Fi story packs noisy action, intrigue, space battles and good feeling . The cuddly story relies heavily on the continued relationship the two protagonists, however is quite amusing. Sensational and perceptible acting by Louis Gossett in spite of the mask and makeup by Chris Wallas(The fly), furthermore he must speak with purring. Spectacular production design by Rolf Zehelbauer(Cabaret, Odessa file, and he&apos;s Fassbinder&apos;s usual). Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Tony Imi. Wonderful music score by Maurice Jarre, though uses synthesizer, he&apos;s a classic musician and habitual of David Lean(Laurence of Arabia,Dr. Zhivago,Ryan&apos;s daughter). The motion picture is directed with sensibility by Wolfgang Petersen , a German working in Hollywood who achieved many hits, before(Das boot,Neverending story), like after( Troy, Perfect storm,Airforce one,Outbreak).

The minority of those who have still managed to keep being human beings in this mess is surrounded &amp; slowly devastated by demoralised animals, created by the decades of communist reign. The realism of the picture is overwhelming &amp; scary. It is so unexpected that a Swedish director have managed to see all the sadness, corruption, violence &amp; immorality of post-USSR space much more clearly than any Russian director ever will. Probably, it is because most people here in Russia see the hell which is going on around them as a normal thing. That&apos;s why we need movies such as this - to face the truth, we are so trying to escape in everyday life. Plus, the film exposes the problem of human traffic in such true-to-life manner, it is painful. Worth watching for former USSR citizens, in order to wake-up &amp; realize how degenerate they&apos;re becoming. Worth watching for foreigners in order to understand how the 99% of people in Russia &amp; other post-soviet countries live, outside the glamorous &amp; fake facades of Moscow city.",

      "reviewBody": "The whole setup here is that we have a professional actor - paid to put on shows about fire and brimstone - who will need to discern over the course of the film who is putting on the show he finds himself in. A film crew is turning this into a movie, presumed to reveal hidden mechanisms that move spectators. Turns out something else is controlling the thing and moving parts we thought we knew all about and possibly us. This will test his mettle as a showman himself, let&apos;s say his faith in the healing power of his act (art?). Is the girl acting out some repressed sexual trauma? Is the father, at the same time covering his tracks with Jesus babble? Or is the demon, the great trickster? (a mild problem here is that, the film being what it is, we never really wonder, do we?)\n\nThis is excellent stuff and could have worked as more than horror. Indeed, until the last part horror is intermittent here. Our focus is on juggling one show as part of another while getting to decide which one horrifies more. The choice for &apos;found footage&apos; is one of the better applications I&apos;ve seen in terms of structure; it means we have one more show running behind the other two, and one that we use to look for the real root of horror. There are many dramatic shots in the flow, but we can chalk these to the presence of a professional cameraman.\n\nThe ending has been reported as problematic. Oh, it is graphic but in ways that have become a staple in films dealing with some extraordinary demonic darkness; Polanski, Rosemary as well as Ninth Gate, the Hammer shocker The Devil Rides Out, Night of the Demon, recently Drag me to Hell. Many viewers bemoan the revelation and tend to prefer the whole thing coated in whispers and rumors. Fair point.\n\nIt works for me because it allows us to recast evil as another staged trick. Another group of people are brought in at the last moment to enact a show, the real deal this time. Real fire and brimstone. Death comes as storyboarded earlier.\n\nIf you&apos;re interested in the scam priest angle, it&apos;s only a light-hearted jab at faith here. Watch Marjoe for a more chilling portrait, the &apos;72 documentary on the &quot;World&apos;s Youngest Ordained Minister&quot;."

The only reason I kept watching was because even though it wasn&apos;t creepy or scary, it was a beautifully shot and very well made film. The story feels different than other vampire movies it&apos;s not just a bunch of the same old vampire clichés. the acting is good for the most part, personally i think the 2 main characters were amazing. It&apos;s kind of long, but the movie gets better as it progresses, the ending is nothing less than what You would expect(considering who directed the film). \n\nSo in short, if you&apos;re looking for scary in the traditional sense You won&apos;t find it here, but if You&apos;re a fan of the Vampire and gore genres or just want to watch a good movie You&apos;ll certainly enjoy it.",

      "reviewBody": "BDT and TLJ are both in top form here. Del Toro gives us prescient glimpses of &apos;Sicario,&apos; while Jones serves us up a two-finger shot of his &apos;US Marshalls&apos; character with a sort of &apos;Life Below Zero&apos; twist added to the rim of the glass.\n\nThe Hunted is clearly inspired by the famous short story, &quot;The Most Dangerous Game.&quot; However, Hunted manages to flip &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; on its axis by giving us a primally brutal wolf fight between two alphas instead of TMDG&apos;s original novel of helpless souls wandering into a rich psychopath&apos;s well-placed bear trap. This time around, it&apos;s not an expert killer hunting down a fatigued cast-away with no combat experience but instead two special-operations-capable-veterans-turned-bushcraft-survivalists testing each other&apos;s capabilities and prowess to their absolute limits.\n\nBut there&apos;s also a little more complexity to The Hunted than just a life or death versus match between two hardened soloists in the bush. The movie also explores the horrors of war on the psyche, the way such unbridled brutality erodes even the soundest of minds when time progresses, and how PTSD can deconstruct a person at their very core.\n\nThis movie is harrowing at some points, particularly during the war crime flashbacks that are absolutely barbaric like the desecration of skeletons and mass Graves being filled with groups of living prisoners who are than obliterated at point blank with M249 SAWs weilded by laughing guerilla fighters.\n\nThere&apos;s a thick air of tension that runs through the entirety of the film&apos;s run time, something I would largely attribute to three things: it&apos;s realistic, intense violent subject matter; it&apos;s lack of a consistent music score flooding the speakers every five minutes and sparse dialogue; it&apos;s setting mostly taking place in the desolate bush. It&apos;s quiet, lethal and bloody--just like BDT&apos;s sadistic knife weilding character.\n\nThe Hunted is a unique action movie that deserves your time. Its pacing is slow and methodical, purposefully scripted as such to match the film&apos;s title no doubt. The slow burn of the story and the film&apos;s execution is almost reminiscent of a 70s film before massive explosions and ridiculous, cheesy one liners from steroided freaks took the genre over; back when movies were smarter and crafted with more earnest and inspiration. It&apos;s also a recommended watch if you&apos;re into Bushcraft survivalism or military drama--much of The Hunted feels like you&apos;re watching the first day of SERE school when you&apos;re being dropped into the forest.\n\n7/10, one of BDT and TLJ&apos;s best.",

Vetran director Hill proves he still knows how to direct a solid action film with kinetic axe, gun and fist fights. Christian Slater has a memorable cameo with Jason Momoa proving he&apos;s more than just a Arnie alternative.\n\nIt&apos;s and old school action with modern slick delivery, worth a watch."

      "reviewBody": "This movie is seriously good.\n\nI&apos;m not saying this just because I&apos;m Norwegian and extremely proud that my country managed to produce this amazing adventure. Kon-Tiki is definitely one of the most original, well- written and fun films I&apos;ve seen this year. \n\nIt&apos;s the 1940s. Without spoiling the story (which is real by the way), we are invited to follow Thor Heyerdahl as he gathers a crew of overly confident Scandinavians attempting to cross the Pacific on a balsa wood raft. All in the name of science and a boyish thirst for adventure! This attitude is understandable; after enduring the misery of WW2, little seemed more tempting than escaping to faraway exotic lands. Bravery or stupidity? In either case, viewers can look forward to one hell of a boat ride. \n\nWhat I adore about Kon-Tiki is the presentation of the raft&apos;s surroundings. The Pacific Ocean is just as magnificent and beautiful as it is dangerous and merciless, and this dynamic is perfectly balanced. Peaceful waters and clear skies suddenly give way for dangerous sea- creatures and storms mighty enough to tear the old-fashioned raft apart. Kon-Tiki is simply grand. At times my adrenaline rose, my heart started pumping, and I started lusting for adventure myself - just by watching. \n\nAnother strong point is the cast. The actors do a brilliant job at depicting the slightly eccentric yet adventurous Scandinavians far away from their Nordic comfort zone. Thor Heyerdahl is particularly well portrayed with his dreamer-like attitude and awkward English skills. Although I would prefer more emphasis on character development, Kon-Tiki make them just interesting enough for viewers to care for them.\n\nKon-Tiki is such a delight to watch, because it&apos;s original, different and not your typical Hollywood adventure flick. No, the plot is not complex. It has no twists or turns, and Kon-Tiki certainly doesn&apos;t contain the amount of drama you&apos;d expect. And this is what makes it good - the film is all about the sheer excitement of the adventure. Of course it isn&apos;t perfect, but for a Norwegian film, I&apos;d say it holds its ground rather strongly.\n\nI honestly haven&apos;t had this much fun with a film for a long while. If you&apos;re lucky, Kon-Tiki might show up on a festival or international cinema near you. In that case, do watch it.",

      "reviewBody": "First of all, I am disgusted by some of these reviews.  Modern action has been overrun by special effects and stuntmen with death wishes (not that I&apos;m complaining), but one must consider the time and the place.  It&apos;s not the world of the Matrix or the Human-Cyborg War (or whatever it&apos;s called) in the Terminator, it&apos;s Hong Kong in the 1980&apos;s with counterfeiting, hostile Chinese syndicates.  It doesn&apos;t have to be a big budget feature to be great. Clerks by Kevin Smith had a minute budget, but it made Smith famous.\n\n I digress.  Woo creates a sensitive and emotionally complex... assassin. To make him reconsider his job as a professional killing machine Jeffrey, the killer, blinds a lounge singer, Jenny.  He swears to himself that he will end his career after one last job.  Woo introduces us to the concept, like you see in A Better Tomorrow, that you can never leave a Triad even if you try your hardest.  With an hour of attempting, Jeff realizes the horrible truth.  Rarely does Woo bring in this feeling of absolute futility in his work.  After losing his best friend, Jeff has crossed the Rubicon in his attempts and must end his ties to it by ending his everyone&apos;s but his own, excluding Jenny and Inspector Lee.  Some people dislike the final shootout, but the doves and the Christian symbology adds a touch that drives religious and heroic bloodshed to the minds of the audience.  On a personal note, I love it.  The last few seconds depict a man, perhaps Lee, playing a harmonica in front of the church for reasons I don&apos;t know.",

Many find the plot clichéd and the action scenes lackluster. However, some praise the visual design and performances by Cate Blanchett and Jack Black. Non-fans often view it as an entertaining, though unspectacular, action-comedy. Common complaints include poor casting and a weak script.

Movies like these should be exciting and unique, with a one of a kind twist that&apos;s newly introduced to the series. You as a director have so many characters and depth to work with in this universe, Yet the director decides to use the most generic and repetitive plots. It goes without saying that the acting in this movie was good (although lacked a bit of depth to the characters personalities imo) and the resemblance of the actors to their original counterparts were not all as accurate as it could&apos;ve been.

I knew Sean Bean was in it and that it was set in the middle ages during the plague, but that&apos;s about it.\n\nIt turned out to be a good suspense movie with some nice plot twists. The best part is how the suspense is slowly built up, until you think you might know what is really going on, and then later you understand its something completely different. No spoilers, but the way the story keeps you guessing and fools you is quite well done.\n\nThe acting is good too with all the minor characters doing believable performances. Carice van Houten is especially noteworthy and interesting as the village leader. She was entrancing and definitely the stand out in the movie. Sean Bean does a workmanlike job as a righteous knight, and as usual is a good presence in the film.\n\nA note on the ending - yes, as other reviewers have said, the ending feels rushed and tacked on, and completely unnecessary. But I can overlook it because it&apos;s quite brief and can be shrugged off and doesn&apos;t detract from the rest of the movie to any degree in my opinion.",

      "reviewBody": "Few movies have affected me on such a deep and emotional level like Son of Saul. I walked into the theater having no idea what the subject matter was, or read any reviews, so I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect. What I witnessed was one of the most difficult and trying pieces about the Holocaust, and a bond between father and son during the most horrific circumstances.\n\nBy now, many of you have read about the unique style and focus of the film. Shot in 35mm, each shot does not fill the screen. There is only one focal point throughout the film, which means people and objects that are close to the camera are in focus, and everything in the background remains out of focus (except for a few shots where we do not center on Saul). This unique and somewhat unprofessional style is an absolute benefit to the overall story that unfolds before the audience. I was sometimes glad that you couldn&apos;t see some of the horrors that were happening all around the main character, but you can tell very plainly what&apos;s happening.\n\nThe story is actually a short one, it takes place in only about a day and a half, but the content of this story is what makes it stand out so brilliantly. Most films about the genocide of the Jewish race during the holocaust have a very broad perspective, showing multiple events to various people who were living through one of the worst horrors man has ever inflicted upon man. Usually these films, like &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot; focus on some savior and the survivors of such events, or even worse movies like &quot;Heart&apos;s War&quot; which fictionalizes a history that is almost insulting to watch. Son of Saul is a much more personal and heart-wrenching story of one prisoner who works under a Sonderkommando labour groups within the walls of Auschwitz Birkenau. There is a definition of such groups at the beginning of the film, and it tells very plainly what their duties were, under threat of death.\n\nIt is very difficult, or rather naught and impossible, to comprehend the level of horror prisoners had to live through during the extermination of their own race, but that is where this film is most successful. It achieved something that I very rarely experience during a film. This is when I cease to remember that I am at the cinema watching a movie unfold before me, and for quite some time, believe that I am right there, bearing witness to these events. That is the true goal of cinema I believe. To have the viewer in complete empathy with what is happening to the characters as the movie progresses. And I was completely and utterly entranced.\n\nThis film is not for the faint of heart. It is horrifying and unbearable at times, but is absolutely unique and utterly phenomenal to watch. A fantastic first for both director László Nemes and lead Géza Röhrig.\n\n9/10",

      "reviewBody": "This is what &quot;Undercover Brother&quot; and &quot;Grindhouse&quot; (minus the &apos;phony&apos; trailers) wished they could have been but weren&apos;t: a tribute to a dismissed period of cinema that feels like it belongs (and comes from) its era.\n\nBut this isn&apos;t just a collection of random jokes or stabs at blaxploitation genre clichés without rhyme or reason. There is an actual story (convoluted and non-sensical but it&apos;s there, and even allows long scenes that advance the plot to unfold without a single obvious joke), there are real characters (over-the-top and cliché&apos; but not two-dimensional walking cardboards) and there are action/fighting scenes (enhanced via the same seamless green screen/CG technology used in &quot;Kung-Pow&quot; a few years back) that make this an actual blaxpoitation movie that just happens to be funny because it&apos;s being so true and respectful to the genre it represents. Michael Jai White looks and inhabits his lead role like he stepped out of the 1970&apos;s; it&apos;s the best casting for a movie since Christopher Reeve got the Superman/Clark Kent role, and I&apos;m not kidding. Supporting actors really get into their blaxpoitation roles (Arsenio Hall and Tommy Davidson are hilarious in too-brief cameos) but they don&apos;t overplay their OTT personalities or overstay their welcome. The way &quot;Black Dynamite&quot; gets around its &apos;R&apos; rating to sneak in a graphic sex scene is not only genius but ties directly with the movie&apos;s best scene in which the &apos;heroes&apos; crack the code in a cafeteria. And the orphanage scene has to be seen to be believed. :-P Only the overblown finale that pushes things way past the breaking point (think &quot;Shoot &apos;Em Up&quot; and yes, it&apos;s that big a misfire) betrays the cinematic illusion that this is a 70&apos;s flick that&apos;s been rotting in a vault somewhere.\n\nI got my $12.50&apos;s worth and will gladly wait for the DVD because I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a joke or two I missed. The one&apos;s that hit the mark are hilarious though. Don&apos;t listen to the DVD Talk reviewer on this one (they&apos;re usually right but this time he&apos;s way off), &quot;Black Dynamite&quot; is a winnah!",

      "reviewBody": "Howard the Duck is a film that I grew up with, I was only a 1 year old when it was released, but my mom and I would watch it together all the time. I think that&apos;s the reason why this movie is just special to me. But still I watch this movie and honestly it&apos;s not as bad as most people exaggerate it to be, granted it&apos;s not Citizen Kane, but it&apos;s still awesome to watch. I think people take the movie too seriously, first off look at the title, if you&apos;re expecting a duck to deliver an Oscar worth performance, get your head checked, second people make fun of the &quot;flirting&quot; between the duck and Lea Thompson, which was meant to be a joke, not real. Third, the ending, people make fun of it and it&apos;s being over the top, I personally found it to be so funny and still a ton of fun to watch, how could you not get a kick out of Jeffrey Jones&apos; performance? He was awesome! If you wanna know what the movie is about, read on before you see the movie so you can get a good idea and judge for yourself.\n\nThe film begins late at night in &quot;Duckworld,&quot; which is a version of planet Earth, but with talking ducks living there in place of human beings. As Howard tries to relax, his armchair begins to vibrate violently, and Howard and the chair are promptly yanked through outer-space, all the way to Cleveland on planet Earth. After ending up in an oil drum, Howard hears a fight involving a woman and two thugs pretending to be her fans. Howard uses his skills of &quot;Quack Fu&quot; to defend her. Intimidated by a talking duck, the thugs scamper. The woman, Beverly, thanks Howard and, feeling sorry for him because he has no warm and dry place to sleep, invites him to her apartment. The next day, Beverly takes Howard to see Phil Blumburtt , who she believes is a scientist that can help Howard get back to Duckworld. It turns out Phil is actually a janitor at a museum and Howard, infuriated with Phil&apos;s charade. A few days later, Dr. Walter Jenning , and Larry who explain to Howard that they were doing a routine procedure at the lab, only for the experiment to go out of control, causing the laser to hit Howard&apos;s planet instead. Howard suggests he can be sent back to Duckworld if the laser can be put into reverse. He is taken to the Dynatechnics lab alongside Beverly, only to find out on arrival that the laser is seriously damaged due to another explosion. The explosion brings down a &quot;Dark Overlord&quot; who is not seen by the audience at the time, and takes over Jenning&apos;s body. Howard and Beverly see Dr. Jenning, but he is in the process of being taken over by the Dark Overlord. With Howard and Beverly both unaware of this, they escape in Jenning&apos;s car onto the freeway with him driving dangerously due to his worsening possession. They stop outside a diner just before he is fully taken over. Inside the Diner, the Overlord explains his attempts to call forth his fellow aliens from the Nexus of Sominus so that they may take over the world.\n\nHonestly, yeah the plot is a bit much to grasp, but cut the movie some slack, it&apos;s about a duck for goodness&apos; sake! For me, it still makes me laugh and I have a ton of fun watching it. I loved seeing Tim Robbins and Howard trying to get to the factory to destroy Jeffrey Jones before he could take over the world, Tim was absolutely hilarious! Yes there are a few things about this movie that are over the top but I still think that this movie is just mindless entertainment. Hey how many movies do we have where a duck saves Planet Earth? Hmm, I guess this is the only one; but give the movie a fair chance, it&apos;s a cute one.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "What a wonderful surprise: Yesterday my sister calls me and tells me that there&apos;s a new film by the director of Brick, playing at the Mill Valley Film Festival. &quot;I&apos;m there!&quot;\n\nEven before we get in the theater, I know we&apos;re in for a different experience. A pair of toughs with metal detectors wave us down for hidden cameras and demand we turn our cell phones off. I&apos;m surprised we didn&apos;t have to take our shoes off. Endgame Entertainment certainly doesn&apos;t want any leaks.\n\nOnce inside, the director, Rian Johnson, shows up just before the show starts, fresh off a flight from Abu Dhabi no less. He gives a short interview with Mark Fishkin (long time director of the festival), coming off as a very charming, self-effacing, funny and unpretentious fellow. I like him immediately. Hollywood has not corrupted him (yet).\n\nLike Tarantino, Johnson has closely studied films and makes constant references and nods to The Classics, especially from the 40s and 50s. Unlike Tarantino, Johnson writes more original stories and has good taste and far gentler sensibilities. Obvious influences include: Wes Anderson, The Cohen Bros, Billy Wilder, John Huston.\n\nThe film itself? Instant classic. It&apos;s got all the elements you could want in a Hollywood-style movie: Charming characters, plot twists, tons of gags, an incredibly beautiful leading lady, sumptuous sets and locations, and an overall sense &quot;gee-whiz-isn&apos;t-this-fun!&quot;\n\nAnd it&apos;s classy, too. It doesn&apos;t resort to needless, sensationalist sex and violence. The writer respects and honors the audience&apos;s intelligence, a all-too-rare occurrence these days.\n\nYou could tell that the actors had a blast with the sometimes subtle, sometimes slap-stick script, relishing their characters&apos; quirks and foibles.\n\nOverall, Brothers Bloom almost manages perfection. It&apos;s one fault lies in the resolution, the last 5 minutes where it&apos;s tone abruptly changes for darker. Without giving anything away, I feel that it was too heavy-handed, considering the generally light and wacky spirit that had predominated. The rest of the audience seemed to feel the same way, given the hushed mood as the credits rolled. If the producers have an alternate ending up their sleeves, I suggest they use it, even it has to be somewhat ambiguous. \n\nOtherwise, I&apos;m happy to contribute to the positive buzz. I really think Brothers Bloom could be a huge hit, even a timeless classic.",

      "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t we all wish our lives could be fairy tales??? In this movie, that&apos;s exactly what one naive and tomboyish girl named Sydney White gets. To us, it seems like a rather familiar story.\n\nWhat Amanda Bynes is so good at is delivering clean and funny teen and family comedies. She is a very funny actress, and continues to be respectable by not screwing up her life like most actresses her age. She&apos;s cute as Sydney, though her tan was not. It was quite over-done in fact. Besides her the ones who steal the show are, of course, the dorks (aka dwarfs). They are certainly adorable, and we can&apos;t help but think that Sydney has found the best possible friends on campus. The downfall in the cast was Sara Paxton as the arch-nemesis Rachel WITCHburn. She just didn&apos;t seem quite evil enough for me. Crystal Hunt was also not that great as Sydney southern friend Dinky.\n\nThere are some laugh-out-loud moments and one-liners. The most fun part of the movie is catching the fairy tale parts as they come. That and watching the dorks. &quot;Sydney White&quot; is a fine family film and will even work well for teens, and it has a very nice message. However, it never reaches any kind of high point and kind of just seems to go on at a continuous rate. Still, it&apos;s worth a watch as a diversion from reality and back into fairy tale world. 6/10 stars! \n\nJay Addison",

There are some genuine funny scenes notably with a magnetic bed, children&apos;s store, the Batmobile getting pulled over (yes, really) and when Arthur goes nail gun happy with future father-in-law Burt Johnson perfectly played by Nick Nolte.\n\nThe realistic sets, New York setting including Grand Central Station act as interesting backdrop that director Jason Winer full utilises. Greta Gerwig as the love interest Naomi Quinn is on likable form while Jennifer Garner refreshingly goes against all American girl typecast as socialite Susan Johnson. Evander Holyfield, Luis Guzmán and Geraldine James Geraldine James put in an appearances. Helen Mirren&apos;s Hobson is touchingly portrayed and Mirren steals the show with her grounded and humanistic performance.\n\nOverall the story stinks of countless 80&apos;s rom-coms but Arthur is entertaining nonetheless due to its nostalgic yet contemporary reworking and Russels&apos; engaging tongue-tied performance."

Gia was a punk teenager in Philadelphia who headed off to New York in the late 1970s and soon became a top fashion model under agent Wilhelmina Cooper (Faye Dunaway.)\n\nSuccess was swift and in the heady days of the early 1980s. She became a supermodel, was openly lesbian/bisexual, did lots of drugs. Unfortunately she was one of the first famous women to die of Aids in 1986.\n\nCo-writer and director Michael Cristofer gives this movie a docudrama approach. It has talking heads discussing aspects of Gia&apos;s life.\n\nGia was undoubtedly a brash woman, she had relationship issues with a girlfriend and a complex relationship with her mother.\n\nDespite being artily shot, some nudity from Ms Jolie. It comes across as another rise and fall true life movie.\n\nAt times it just felt skin deep and a bit camp. Nothing about the pressures of the fashion industry where drug use is regarded as common.\n\nThe taboo aspects of Aids in the 1980s is dealt with. It should had been a movie that amounted to something more. Jolie certainly showed why she was regarded as a rising star.",

Dystopian future or post-apocalyptic movies kind of blend together after you&apos;ve seen a lot of them. So when one comes along that feels fresh like this one, it deserves praise for that alone. The acting is excellent. Guy Pearce has long been an actor whose work I enjoy but the big surprise here is Robert Pattinson, who ensures with this performance that he will be remembered for more than the Twilight movies. Taut direction with quality acting, writing, and music. It&apos;s a good movie but not for everybody. Dark, gritty, often slow and certainly violent.

Brit Marling and Ellen Page both give us a great performance. I was disappointed by Alexander Skarsgård, I thought that he was the weak player of the cast. The rest of the cell was pretty solid: Toby Kebbell, Shiloh Fernandez, Aldis Hodge, and Danielle Macdonald. And I should mention the nice work done by Patricia Clarkson as the director of the private security firm.\n\nThe bad. The ending is rushed. It feels like there was missing material at the end of filming and they couldn&apos;t go back to get what they needed and had to edit it with what they had.\n\nThe ugly. Nothing.\n\nThe result.

      "reviewBody": "The Green Inferno (2013) \n\n** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nA group of college students decide to head to South America where they&apos;re going to protest some developers who are damaging the rain forest and threatening a tribe that has lived there for thousands of years. Their plan doesn&apos;t quite work when their plane crashes in the jungle and soon the survivors have the unlucky fate of being served up for dinner.\n\nEli Roth&apos;s homage to the Italian cannibal movies of the 70s and early 80s is a rather mixed bag. After the movie was over I really didn&apos;t know what to think about it because there had been so much hype built around it. For the most part I don&apos;t think the film lived up to the hype but this is going to depend on your knowledge of the genre. If you have no idea what CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, EATEN ALIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX are then there&apos;s a great chance that you&apos;re going to be shocked and horrified at what you see here. If you&apos;re familiar with those films then you&apos;re going to see THE GREEN INFERNO as a watered down American film.\n\nAgain, it&apos;s really hard to judge this movie but I&apos;m overly familiar with the Italian cannibal movies so let me get that out of the way. I think this film is going to shock, outrage and gross out the majority of the people who watch it as there&apos;s no question that this contains some of the most graphic and goriest violence that has ever been in an American film that had to go in front of the MPAA. How this got a R-rating is rather shocking in itself and it really makes you laugh when you watch something like this and think at one point something like SCREAM had to be cut to avoid a NC-17 rating. Again, the gore effects are rather great with many practical effects that are quite effective. The gore and violence, again, will shock most people.\n\nWith that said, if you&apos;re familiar with the brutal films in the genre then you&apos;re not going to blink an eye here. There&apos;s really nothing shocking, outrageous or too graphic if you&apos;re familiar with the films that I mentioned before. This movie certainly doesn&apos;t have the animal violence but it also doesn&apos;t have the graphic rape, mutilations or any of the infamous moments from those films. You&apos;d think that this homage would wink at those movies and their graphic moments but the film doesn&apos;t even try. This just gives the movie an overall watered down feel that fans of the genre are going to notice and especially when you consider that there&apos;s not even any real nudity in the picture. If you can&apos;t show nudity then you know certain elements of violence aren&apos;t going to be shown.\n\nI think another disappointing thing is that the jungle settings really aren&apos;t used. Those Italian movies worked so well because you could enjoy them as adventure stories but that&apos;s not the case here. I will say that the build-up was a lot more entertaining than I expected it to be because the violence doesn&apos;t happen until the last portion of the movie. The performances are certainly better than you&apos;d expect with Lorenza Izzo making for a good and likable lead. The story itself is okay with some sly humor thrown in at times but then again there are some really stupid moments. There&apos;s one girl in the cage who gets &quot;sick&quot; and this scene is just downright stupid. There&apos;s an incredibly awful jump scare towards the end, which will have you rolling your eyes.\n\nTHE GREEN INFERNO is a decent movie but at the same time it doesn&apos;t quite live up to all the hype that people have created for it the past couple years."

      "name": "Far from Aardman&apos;s best, but still a very funny film.",
      "reviewBody": "Pirates! An Adventure with Scientists or Band of Misfits as it is known outside the UK for some reason, is the latest stop-motion feature from Aardman Animations, the studio behind the likes of Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run. It is based on the first two novels in the Pirates! Series by Gideon Defoe.\n\nSet in 1837, the story follows the adventures of a pirate captain called Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant) in his attempts to win the Pirate of the Year competition for the first time. Despite being mostly deluded and incompetent he is actually kind at heart and has the respect of his crew. He is really up against it through when it comes to winning the competition because he is a pretty rubbish pirate and is up against the cream of the piratical world which includes Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek) and Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven). While attempting to rob a ship, Pirate Captain has a chance meeting with Charles Darwin (David Tennant) who notices that the ship&apos;s parrot, Polly is in fact the world&apos;s last Dodo. Darwin, the Captain and his crew travel to London to show the Scientific community their discovery but while there risk bumping into the staunchly anti-pirate, Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton).\n\nAs you&apos;d expect from an Aardman production, the film is full of both subtle and not so subtle humour. One of the first things that made me laugh was the names of Pirate Captain&apos;s crew. There is The Pirate with a Scarf (Marin Freeman), so named because he wears a scarf, The Pirate with Gout (Brendan Gleeson) who is fat, the Albino Pirate (Russell Tovey) and the best of them all, the Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate (Ashley Jensen) who is a woman in a fake beard. They are great names which bought a smile to my face each time they were used. A lot of the humour comes from the book on which the film is based but it is liberally laced with Aardman&apos;s trademark subtlety. Every shop sign or wanted poster features a pun and there are nods to the likes of Blackadder. It&apos;s the sort of film that will take several viewings in order to see all of the jokes.\n\nThe animation is top notch, as it should be. Aardman are the masters of their art and having dabbled in stop-motion animation myself, I understand the time and effort that must go into making a stop-motion feature. Aardman has come a long way from the rough and ready clay models of The Wrong Trousers but the models still maintain their distinctive style and it is obvious that care has been taken during each of the millions of frames.\n\nThe voice cast is excellent. Most of the actors are instantly recognisable but David Tennant puts on a convincing accent for his interpretation of Charles Darwin. The actors help to make the scrip very funny and I&apos;m pleased to see that the filmmakers have stuck with a mostly British cast and stayed away from an A-List star.\n\nThe soundtrack is enjoyable and uses songs which are not only great but fit the story perfectly. You can expect to hear the likes of The Clash, Flight of the Concords and Blur.\n\nWhile my girlfriend, most of the adult audience and myself enjoyed the film, the young children in the audience seemed a little bored by it. I don&apos;t think there was enough in the film to keep the young children entertained and a lot of the humour was going over their head. It is almost like the film has been pitched at an adult audience, which is fine and worked, but with a U rating and an Easter release, lots of children will go and may be disappointed.\n\nThis is not Aardman&apos;s best work but it was an enjoyable 88 minutes that featured plenty of laughs and a fairly interesting but in the end throw away plot. I would definitely go back to watch the sequel and will watch it again when it is inevitably shown on TV during a future Christmas period.\n\nwww.attheback.blogspot.com",

      "reviewBody": "Considering there are now more than 75 reviews on the movie, I&apos;ll keep it brief.\n\nEmily Blunt, Chris Evans, Andy Garcia, Catherine O&apos;Hara and all the actors turn in strong performances. It&apos;s really their acting that made the story engaging and effective. Especially considering the big pharma genre of drama movies has been milked a lot lately. Blunt is a stand-out here, bringing emotion to every scene she&apos;s in.\n\nYou&apos;ll get high drama, a little suspense, a few laughs and feel a connection with at least one of the main characters. You will likely also feel some anger... and compassion for Emily Blunt&apos;s character and her daughter.\n\nIt&apos;s a bit longer than I felt it should&apos;ve been but it will keep you interested to see how it all comes to a head at the end. If you&apos;ve got a couple hours and are looking for a dramatic story about the corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, this movie is worth the watch. A move has to be almost life-changing for me to rate it 8, 9, or10, but in my book, this one is a solid 7.",

Sebastian Haff likes to be called by his real name, which is Elvis Presley (Bruce Campbell). Also in the home is JFK (Ossie Davis), who is now an elderly black man. Both Elvis and JFK are in their twilight years and well and truly past their prime.\n\nThere are problems at night in the convalescence home as an unfriendly predator stalks the home for souls to steal. Elvis and his friend JFK team up to rid the home of the unfriendly predator.\n\nThe story is quite unusual and fun, there is comedy and some mild horror. The touching part is Elvis questioning his young life, and the dramas and challenges of dealing with old age. The soul searching from Elvis lifts the quality of the movie from being just another B grade movie.\n\nIts a low budget movie and a bit dated by now, but the good performances of Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis carry the movie well.\n\nI was expecting a little bit better movie from reading some reviews. However I was not disappointed with the move due to it being both quirky and sensitive.",

      "reviewBody": "There are really two kinds of people watching this film: one group genuinely loves it with all their heart, and another shows up mainly to mock it and not so much the film itself, but the so-called cringe audience that enjoys it. Then there&apos;s a third category: people who just want to judge it fairly, on its own merits and flaws, without picking a side. Here&apos;s an honest take for that third group.\n\nMerits\n\n1. The Songs Easily the film&apos;s strongest point. Every song is woven seamlessly into the story, they don&apos;t feel forced, they carry it. It&apos;s the kind of album you&apos;ll replay on your own. Solid 8/10.\n\n2. The Acting Both debutants deliver more than decent performances for their first outing. Sure, some moments feel a touch dramatic or raw, but they do land scenes that make you feel their pain and love. Credit where it&apos;s due: 6.5/10.\n\n4. The Pacing Overall, the film moves well. The first half drags a bit, but that slower buildup works to establish the characters. The second half picks up enough to balance it out. 7/10.\n\n4. The Chemistry The leads genuinely have spark. Aneet looks effortlessly stunning throughout, and Ahaan pulls off the classic lover boy vibe convincingly. Their chemistry does a lot of heavy lifting. 8/10.\n\nDemerits\n\n1. The Screenplay This is where things stumble. It&apos;s basically a loose rehash of the Korean film A Moment to Remember, and it shows painfully so if you&apos;ve seen the original. The emotional beats are there but the stitching is weak. 4/10.\n\n2. The Direction Typical Mohit Suri hit or miss. Here it&apos;s mostly average. Some characters wander in and out with no real purpose. A tighter grip on the story could have elevated this so much more. 3.5/10.\n\n3. The Emotional Depth While the film tries hard to tug at your heartstrings, it doesn&apos;t always land the emotional punches it aims for. Some scenes feel melodramatic instead of genuinely moving, and the payoff isn&apos;t as strong as it should be for a story like this. The result: moments that should break you end up just feeling nice instead of unforgettable. 5/10\n\nVerdict\n\nIn the end, this film is exactly what it looks like: a decent one-time watch. If you love the songs and have a soft spot for star-crossed lovers, you&apos;ll find moments to enjoy. Just don&apos;t expect a masterpiece and skip the fan wars.\n\nFinal word: Watch it for the music, the chemistry, and a few heartfelt moments then move on.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1943, in Tibet, a monk (Yun-Fat Chow) renounces his name and becomes the new guardian of a powerful scroll. Meanwhile, a troop of Nazis leaded by a sick commander invades the monastery and kills the other monks, trying to steal the scroll. The monk without name spends the next sixty years protecting the scroll and looking for his successor, who shall be a person who fulfills three prophecies. In USA, he meets the lonely pickpocket Kar (Seann William Scott), and he believes that Kar may be the next protector of the scroll. Kar stays with the monk and falls in love with the beautiful Jade (Jaime King), while the monk is chased by a gang leaded by the former nazi commander and his daughter Nina. I found this film a good entertainment. There are lots of action, funny moments and in the end, it is a good action movie. The beauty of the unknown Jaime King is very impressive. I really did not understand why the scroll is not simply destroyed, since neither the guardians nor the monks use its power except for keeping the youth of the protector for sixty years. Further, the motives for the parallel life of Jade are simply ridiculous. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &apos;O Monge à Prova de Balas&apos; (&apos;The Bulletproof Monk&apos;)",

It looks like a pre-packedged thriller, &quot;homogenized&quot; I&apos;d say, with much part of it taking place in chats. Bruce Willis and Halle Berry have acted much better in past, but are watchable regardless, as well as Giovanni Ribisi; suspense thriller is made bearable but eventually degenerates..",

      "reviewBody": "I suppose I could just really rake this movie over the coals if I wanted to, but what&apos;s the point? It&apos;d be like beating a physically handicapped kid in arm wrestling - it&apos;s way easy, but you walk away without really accomplishing anything, and you feel kind of bad afterwards.\n\nPlus, I&apos;m not exactly part of the main demographic for this movie, and if you aren&apos;t part of the demographic, then why would you even consider paying money to see it? What are you expecting? This is a movie about a lifelike car that spits exhaust in the faces of bad guys, leaks oil on their bad guy shoes, and opens its trunk, doors, or glove compartment whenever something needs to be revealed or somebody needs to be strategically hit in a slapstick manner. If those types of shenanigans send you rolling down the aisles in apoplectic fits of laughter then you&apos;re in luck. However, if you&apos;re like me and aren&apos;t quite so easily amused then you might want to veer your hard-earned dollars in another direction.\n\nEven though I&apos;ve never been a fan of the Herbie series, and this movie did nothing to make me a convert, there are some positives. The most important being that Lindsay Lohan is looking very good and is in fine pre-anorexia, pre-fake blonde form. She claims her current look (Ode De Skeletal Olsen Twin) is for a movie she&apos;s doing in which she plays a fashion designer, and she promises to put her weight back on. I hope so because she definitely looks better with a little meat on them bones! The second positive is that the entire cast is giving it their best. They&apos;re not given great material to work with, but at least they look like they&apos;re having a little fun. I&apos;m quite sure Matt Dillon is well aware that this isn&apos;t exactly a step up from his previous movie, Crash, but he doesn&apos;t use that as an excuse to phone in his performance, so I have to give credit there.\n\nI think they should&apos;ve renamed the movie though. I would&apos;ve suggested Herbie: Fully Loaded WITH MUSIC MONTAGES! Sheesh. I honestly don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen one movie with that many montages. At times I thought I was watching a series of Disney music videos. What in the world? Was this a prime example of avoiding dialogue? Oh well. At times boring, and never threatening to entice riotous laughter, Herbie at least moves along at a decent pace and is never quite so stupid that it&apos;s intellectually insulting, so I won&apos;t be too harsh. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s loads of fun for the really young (under 7). However, when I asked my 10-year-old brother what he thought of the movie he replied, &quot;It was OK.&quot; When I asked if he thought it was funny he replied, &quot;Kind of. I guess.&quot; Not exactly a ringing endorsement but not a total condemnation either.",

But if you just want to watch a funny movie with some friends then definitely give this movie a chance! It&apos;s somewhat of a spoof on the &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; films. Marlon Wayans plays the main character who buys a brand new video camera for the moving in of his girlfriend. He then gets camera&apos;s set up around his house for security purposes.\n\nRight off the bat, his girlfriend suspects there&apos;s a ghost in the house and like in the &quot;Paranormal&quot; films he doesn&apos;t believe it. Some scenes are similar, but take a huge change and it becomes funny. Sure some of the jokes are over the top but for the most part, are hilarious.\n\nCedric the Entertainer makes an appearance towards the end of the film and his scenes are great. Bottom line, watch this movie to get a good laugh. 6/10 for exceeding my expectations.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. The very imaginative and quite funny opening credit sequence sets the stage for a fun frolic through the world of corporate espionage. The only two problems ... it&apos;s not that much fun and there is very little frolicking.\n\nWriter/Director Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton) just tries to be too clever and cute for his own good. After landing two perfect leads and two of the best character actors of this generation, Gilroy offers up a tedious, bungled mess that is really never that clever and certainly gives the feeling of holding back these four fine actors.\n\nThe multi-frame look, non-linear time line, repeated dialogue and smirky exchanges between Clive and Julia are just some of the clichéd tricks used to make this seem more interesting and complicated than it really is.\n\nClive Owen shows again that he would have made a sterling James Bond (nothing against Daniel Craig, who is excellent). Instead of his usual dark, brooding roles, he seems to thrive when he can show a bit of emotion. Luckily for the audience, we are only subjected to one of Julia Roberts&apos; patented cackles that causes every man to cringe. For her, she is quite reserved, but just can&apos;t pull off the smartest person in the room role. Sadly, the great Tom Wilkinson is pretty much wasted in his role as one of the dueling corporate giants. Paul Giamatti, on the other hand, has the best scene in the film as he delivers over-the-top arrogance in his stockholders speech.\n\nMust also mention Tom McCarthy, not so much for his role (he is the guy handcuffed in the meeting room), but just because I have become such a fan of his directorial skills ... The Station Agent and The Visitor.\n\nIf you are after a dime store version of Michael Clayton or a mostly non-funny Cary Grant type film, then this is the film for you. To me, it just doesn&apos;t deliver the quips, twist or turns that it pretends to.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s staggering to come up against a filmmaker who has a truly mad vision to put onto celluloid. If it&apos;s really believable and the maker isn&apos;t just putting on the audience it can take us into that madness. Possession is a film that is like it&apos;s title, taken with it&apos;s own sense of grandeur, starting off as a Scenes-from-a-Marriage-esque tale of downfall - with more ZAP and wildness in the fights the married couple have - but with something just not quite right. These scenes feel raw and uninhibited, by the actors and by the material, which goes to such extremes of how much they hurt one another that it becomes perversely funny.\n\nWhy all the camera movement in this film, especially early on, where it turns into Vittorio Storaro Time with a Red Bull chaser? From the sensibility of the high emotions and hysteria on display, why not? If your material is going all out, then you might as well go all out with it. Isabelle Adjani really, REALLY goes to town here, forgetting that there&apos;s such a thing as &apos;chewing scenery&apos; and just stampeding through it at times, with Sam Neill and the camera operator being breathless to keep up. It&apos;s a film that moves with real force and energy... sometimes maybe TOO much force and energy.\n\nFor a film like possession, excess is not something that can be kept back, but what is so fascinating is that it&apos;s so intense at times, in the husband/wife interactions, the emotional violence springing out into physical abuse (at one point a slap is then encouraged into more, an uncomfortable scene done just right), that it&apos;s fascinating because it&apos;s going into such high volume. And as a horror film, a true horror film of the soul where it&apos;s laid bare and stripped out by a demon and f***ed with a spiky tail or something, it&apos;s bewildering, mind-boggling, and a dark pile of fun.\n\nA lot of it is the performances - Adjani worked her ass off to get that Cannes best actress win, and though there are times I can&apos;t understand her (not sure if it&apos;s the accent or the lines, like her &apos;fate and chance&apos; monologue) and runs the gamut as a character who starts out flawed and damaged and gets so turned-inside-out she makes Linda Blair in the Exorcist look like a... girl. And Sam Neill has a kind of strange appeal here - at times he talks like he doesn&apos;t take these lines seriously, or is doing so SO much that it just becomes funny, and other times he is genuinely power-punching with his dramatic touch. In a scene like the restaurant fight he goes between both levels.\n\nBut why I may, someday, after I can get over the experience, would return to Possession is that among the f***ing-insane style of films out there, there&apos;s nothing else quite like it. It revels in bringing the audience into its horror set-pieces, especially with that creature in the apartment as ambiguous a demon as the baby in Eraserhead, and the dread in every man going into that apartment harder to bear than the one before. And there is genuine pain, I think, in the filmmaking. I don&apos;t know the history behind the film&apos;s gestation but I&apos;d wager the director had a bad marriage and expressed it, literally and metaphorically, with a tale of an unfaithful woman brought to madness by a demon... or maybe that&apos;s it.\n\nPossession doesn&apos;t spoon-feed at any point in time. On the contrary, and maybe this is a flaw I think, there&apos;s so little explanation of anything in the film that by the last fifteen minutes as Sam Neill&apos;s character goes ape-s**t and the husband/wife&apos;s child just gives up. It got to the point where I had my hands up in a &apos;what the hell!?&apos; position sitting in my seat in the theater. Perhaps another viewing would solve some of my quandaries, or just make new ones. Whatever the case, the mood of this film is chilling and harrowing, and for those who like their dolly shots, this is a must-must-MUST see. Oh, and by the way, the creature effects - by the guy that did E.T.(!)",

What started out as a very straight forward horror film has over the past four sequels turned into a comedy with gore in it. That&apos;s not to say that Seed Of Chucky is a bad film by any means. It&apos;s actually really funny. While many compared New Nightmare to the Player for its blending of reality and fantasy, this film actually does it as well but manages to stick more to the satiric humour of The Player. There are Hollywood jokes galore and references to past films. Chucky&apos;s Ode to The Shining is pure hilarity and even Jennifer Tilly herself isn&apos;t safe as she manages to send up her own image more than even the rest of the cast around her. While Seed of Chucky is enjoyable for what it is, I can only hope that they decide to return the series to its terror roots if another is to be made.",

It&apos;s like a live-action film with great actors :) Every single emotion is magnificently drawn! When you watch this animation, you shouldn&apos;t expect a thriller or scenes of action.. the story is widely dramatic and heartbreaking. It has lots of suspenseful moments that make you want to watch it till the end and the ending is really worth the wait! The anime is about family problems and a young &amp; ill girl&apos;s way of dealing with it. One could say that it is her coming of age story which is not easy for her, so she finds a &quot;friend&quot;, a mysterious foreigner who helps to find herself and make her see the world with different eyes ;) People who think animations are just for children or for younger generation are completely wrong! If you have prejudices, go and watch one and see it for yourself! I can recommend Spirited Away &amp; Grave of the Fireflies. And I really can&apos;t believe that Studio Ghibli will take a break from filmmaking now... or will maybe never come back to it again. It&apos;s a mess! After seeing so much untalented people doing so many films and earning much money (especially those cheesy Hollywood animations), although for not deserving it, I&apos;m aware of the fact that real artists should be praised! BTW: I don&apos;t easily give a film 10/10 ;)",

It&apos;s no classic, has its flaws but it just refuses to take itself seriously. The three leads are very strong - Seth Green just edging it cos hes just adorable in this! Some very, VERY funny moments in this, maybe a little too many moments where the films tries to over emphasise some messages but that will be clear when you&apos;ve seen the film. Also a total &quot;where have I seen you before&quot; moment with the girl from Clueless! However, I fully recommend you give this film a try, you won&apos;t be disappointed! 8/10 for comedy with a heart!",

However, the film faces criticism for subpar acting, a disjointed narrative, and lackluster music and choreography.

      "reviewBody": "The Archies is just a movie that could &amp; should have been avoided in the first place by NetflixIndia &amp; by a director like Zoya Akhtar who always have been associated with the best of cinema in India, it would have saved Netflix tremendous loads of money to fund in some quality content on the lines of TVF or maybe something like Kohrra or CAT.\n\nStory : The Archies starts with the introduction to the town of Riverdale somewhere in the Northern India which is inhabited by the Anglo Indian&apos;s(citizens with mixed Indian &amp; European ancestors).\n\nWe are introduced to the characters of Archie Andrews(Agastya Nanda), Veronica Lodge(Suhana Khan), Betty Copper(Khushi Kapoor), Jughead(Mihir Ahuja), Reggie Mantle(Vedang Raina) &amp; Ethel Muggs(Dot.) enjoying their respective lives in this picturesque town.\n\nThe story directly dives into the return of Veronica &amp; her family to the town of Riverdale, all the friends uniting back, Archie Andrews stuck in a love triangle &amp; the intentions of Veronica&apos;s father to build a big hotel in the middle of Green Park which is heart &amp; soul of Riverdale.\n\nPerformances : I shouldn&apos;t talk about it, because everyone acted really well except the main lead characters, having such a great supporting cast with expressionless lead cast was just painful to watch &amp; it just doesn&apos;t end at expressions, even the dialogue delivery is just really bad especially for Suhana Khan &amp; Khushi Kapoor, Zoya it seemed had intentionally avoided taking close up shots for any of the actors.\n\nDirection and Screenplay : The Gully Boy director has always shown us how brilliant she is with her cinema be it Dil Dhakane Do or Made in Heaven, she knows on how to engage the audiences to the screen &amp; over here it just seemed as if Zoya was not on director&apos;s chair, bad acting, non engaging screenplay, can&apos;t imagine Zoya not noticing all this during the shooting.\n\nThe credits where due, cinematography looked terrific(especially loved the entry scene of Dot on the cycle &amp; camera switching from rear to front), colours/sets/costumes were all perfectly done.\n\nMusic : This is a musical story and it had to have great music, while some songs are really good such as Sunoh &amp; In Rahoon Mein, the rest feel underwhelming &amp; this is not the expectation when you have Shankar Ehsaan Loy at the helm of it.\n\nGood/Bads : Avoid it, save time and probabaly go &amp; watch something worthy, the movie shouldn&apos;t have been made in the first place because The Archies has so much to it that you just can&apos;t fit all in a short runtime, the audience needs to know Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge in detail, each character needed to have their own arc for the audience to feel for them &amp; connect with them, this is what Riverdale did in the starting seasons even though it lost the grip in last few seasons but still the audience came back in for their favourite characters.\n\nThe main leads really need to excel on their acting capabilities, dialogue delivery &amp; this movie did not offer them anything that they could take away from their debut launch except the hard lessons.\n\nZoya Akhtar has a dent on her sky high filmography with TheArchies but we still know how good she can be when she wants so waiting for the next Tiger Baby production.",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Wolf Children",
      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;d ever need to know why 2D animation is still relevant, or why the slew of 3D animated films can&apos;t seem to dent and push the former out of fashion, then perhaps Wolf Children encapsulates all the reasons why this is so. There&apos;s a lack of charm with the very clinical approach to animated films, especially with loads of images created digitally, and now for the 3D format, and this charm is always ever present in the traditional art form for the big screen. And don&apos;t forget that story remains king.\n\nDirector Mamoru Hosoda continues on his roll with a brand of animated films that are extremely well received, because not only are they drawn to perfection in anime style, but also his films touches the emotional core on humanity, and this will inevitably move you with his style and delivery of such strong stories, whether written by someone else, as a film adaptation of novels such as The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, or like in Summer Wars and Wolf Children, stem from his own imagination. And what a fantastic reservoir of imagination he&apos;s tapping from as well, either telling stories with relevance to a digital age, or as in this case, a fairy tale like allure that is deceptively simple, yet concealing a very strong ode to motherhood.\n\nYes that&apos;s right. For the most parts throughout this film, I thought it also resembled Yoji Yamada&apos;s Kabei: Our Mother, in the sense that this film takes on story proportions centered around a mother&apos;s unconditional love for her children, and the continuous strive to make ends meet and bring up her children to the best of her ability, inculcating a value system into her young ones. And the episodes the mothers encounter strengthen their resolve and determination, just goes to show the lengths they will go to in ensuring proper upbringing filled with love, care and concern. This simple narrative will undoubtedly move, only if it&apos;s done right, which Wolf Children did, complete with a fantastical element which provides a refreshing examination looking in, with a little bit of grotesque morbidity if one cannot look away from.\n\nI dislike to use this analogy, but perhaps it may strike an immediate chord with the current generation. Twilight has progressed and shown the decision Bella made to be with Edward, and in some ways, Wolf Children is like a what if to that scenario had she decided to be with Jacob. Hana (voiced by Aoi Miyazaki) meets up with a tall, handsome stranger in class (Takao Osawa), and before you can say Twilight, they fall in love, and it is revealed that her lover is a Wolfman. Undeterred, they begin a family, and soon Hana gives birth to the titular daughter Yuki and son Ame, before tragedy strikes and the family becomes a dysfunctional one without a father figure.\n\nFearing that her children may be discovered to be wolf-human hybrids, with a number of scenes showing the challenges she faces such as their tantrums and uncontrollable changes, or the dilemma faced when they fall sick, she decides to uproot and move into the countryside, where life is simpler, neighbours are far away from one another, and there is room to, well, let her young ones roam in the vast grasslands and mountain sides. A new life beckons, and the film begins its homage to all moms having to struggle to bring up their children in unfamiliar surroundings, with little assistance, and plenty of inexperience.\n\nAs a storyteller, Mamoru Hosoda excelled in character development, as we journey together with Hana in her upbringing, with the children endearing themselves to you in double quick time. They are adorably designed, drawn and brought to life, whether in their human form, or in animal form. We identify with everyone easily because of the inherent humanity Hosoda gives them, whether or not we are already a mom, or reflect that onto the challenges faced by our own mom&apos;s upbringing of ourselves. And both Yuki and Ame, besides their gender, have very contrasting qualities, from young to their teens, a tale told to just about the time where teenage rebellion and the need to forge their own independence take centerstage.\n\nThere are plenty of episodes in Wolf Children that covers a spectrum of emotions, from comedy to those that will set heaviness in your heart. The innocence of the children will not get lost on you, and in fact will rub off you, while the pains of growing up will also touch a raw nerve, as Hosoda clearly knows which moments in one&apos;s teenage life to translate his story for the screen, bringing relevance the forgetting that the children were in fact more than meets the eye. And the animation is clearly Hosoda&apos;s vision in having details balanced with the occasional need for scarcity, which nailed it especially when the narrative calls for some distance either physically, or emotionally, and it&apos;s a stylistic choice that&apos;s already seen in a number of his films.\n\nMamoru Hosoda set up his Studio Chizu with this production, and I&apos;m really looking forward to more stories in the coming years. Meanwhile, Wolf Children is a must watch, and a clear favourite for the year. A little pity that it&apos;s not opening on more screens, but make your way to the Filmgarde cineplexes as this remains an exclusive to the chain. Meanwhile, I&apos;m going to look back at Hosoda&apos;s filmography on DVD/Blu!",

      "reviewBody": "A fantastic film about a country whose history is seldom portrayed, A Royal Affair is a historical drama set in the latter half of the 18th century in Denmark. An English girl is sent off to marry the Danish king, only to find out that he&apos;s not fully sane. In her loneliness she falls for the king&apos;s doctor, and they find they share not only amorous feelings for one another, but a passion for Enlightenment ideas and political reforms.\n\nThere are a few caricatures in this movie that keep me from giving it a higher score: the reactionary forces are pure, unalloyed evil; the reformers are probably far more liberal in thinking than would have been possible in that era; and the preaching against established religion is a bit thick. But otherwise, this is a gem of a movie with outstanding performances in all three key roles, particularly the doctor who is portrayed with an incredible intensity and realism. Also noteworthy is the king who is not quite sane yet not totally loony either; the acting here is frighteningly good and utterly convincing. Last but not least, the queen excels in showing real pathos and long-suffering endurance trapped in her destiny, and then comes alive beautifully in her relationship with the doctor.\n\nAs icing on the cake, costumes are sumptuous, period settings flawless, and the music is era-appropriate and delightfully arcane. Original music is also quite good, though most of the time one is so engrossed in the story that the music just vanishes. Movie is almost all in Danish with English subtitles, and I felt the size/font choice for the titles was too big, too pushy, you never quite forget that you&apos;re reading titles.\n\nThis is a tale of exploration of the darker side of the human experience: what does it mean to be sane, how can a divinely ordained monarch be deprived of his wits, to what lengths will a person go to promote his/her progeny into power, are the &quot;unwashed masses&quot; really grateful to those who try to emancipate them? This movie (and its three main characters) will haunt you for many days.",

Acting was good and photography was good to but not that much on story .little sloppy on screenplay . Except for the first song rest of them were really misplaced . Even if they removed the songs wouldn&apos;t bad. Hrithik was good and did hold up his own , but might not be right role for him. Rest of cast did good and were apt . Villan was good looking but man had a single line dialogue. Should have more . One time watch that too if you hardcore fan of Hrithik .",

      "reviewBody": "A flawed movie,  but worth seeing for De Niro&apos;s performance as Gil Renard, an increasingly crazed fan/stalker. Also, yet again, baseball shows itself as the sport most able to provide striking visual metaphors for the ups and downs of life (though, as a Brit, I&apos;ve noted some of the specific criticisms aimed at the baseball sequences in this movie by IMDb commenters from the US).\n\nWhere the movie, via the genius of De Niro, certainly succeeds is in convincingly demonstrating how easily and quickly obsessive devotion can turn to obsessive hatred, when the object of that devotion fails to meet the assumptions of the extreme fan. Certainly, there&apos;s some of Max Cady, the Cape Fear psychotic, in his portrayal; but there&apos;s also a lot of Rupert Pupkin, the confused kidnapper and would-be comic from King of Comedy - both films, of course, directed by Martin Scorsese.\n\nWhere the film fails is in being too repetitive and, consequently, a bit too long; one or two of the scenes where Gil is trying to sell his knives are superfluous; and, when Gil is at the game with his son, why does the camera have to keep cutting to the woman in the crowd - once or twice would have been sufficient. Several of the scenes also seem derivative, especially those involving Dan Butler, as Garitty the sales manager, which echo Glengarry Glen Ross. A major unconvincing aspect is that surely a $40m signing, like Bobby Raybourn (Wesley Snipes), would be surrounded by a lot more razzmatazz than simply one not-too-effective agent (John Leguizamo).\n\nBut, on the whole, one to rent or watch on TV (as I&apos;ve just done) if nothing more compelling is available.",

Surely, the film is at least worth a watch for their performance, right? Well, a more appropriate title for the movie would have been &apos;The Big Disaster In the Name of a Movie&apos;. Yes, it&apos;s messy, silly and...not funny. &apos;the Big Wedding&apos; was sold as a romantic comedy wedding flick but the &apos;jokes&apos; appear forced, desperate and lack originality. Moreover it pokes fun at Catholics, free spirited people and divorced couples. The aforementioned talented actors are wasted which is a real shame. The younger cast&apos;s performance ranges from average to poor. The set and outdoor sceneries provide some nice eye-candy. Loaded with clichés, pretending to be funny and wasting talents, this expensive film is kind of...well, trash."

It definitely &quot;feels&quot; like a 90s movie at times, and it can be a bit cheesy, but it doesn&apos;t really need to be anything more or less than that in my opinion.\n\nThe performances by Kevin Bacon and Meryl Streep are great. I loved seeing Bacon play a bad guy, I don&apos;t know if I ever have until this point. The story is gripping mostly during the latter half of the movie, the intensity is turned up and there&apos;s a pretty solid payoff by the end of it. This movie would be too generic if it weren&apos;t for the river setting throughout the whole movie - it really added some memorable moments, and I&apos;m sure I won&apos;t be forgetting this one.\n\nOverall, this was a fun time! It has everything that I&apos;d normally look for in a suspenseful/thriller, has likable cast members and throws a spin on a conventional drama, turning it into something memorable and worth giving a look.",

The reason the friends were there, a little silly but added an interesting dynamic.\n\nI came into this movie with an open mind, and enjoyed it. I could watch it again, but I don&apos;t have to.\n\nThe kills are fun, the spook factors are a little hit and miss, and perhaps I would liked to have seen more different monsters come to life. But that&apos;s life and I can&apos;t say i disagree with the director on any decisions that were made. Sometimes you can&apos;t have it all.\n\nThe atmosphere of the movie is sort of typical isolation/cabin fever style with a ground hog day twist. In some ways it reminded of a good rogue like video game, every night is something sort of different.\n\nI actually gave this movie a 6.5/10. I enjoyed it, I liked the story and acting. I also enjoyed not knowing what the threat was going to be next. It&apos;s a fun movie, and that&apos;s the point.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a nice vehicle for Tobey Maguire who does a good job of portraying a paranoid schizophrenic, but that person is not Robert James Fischer. They got Maguire&apos;s hair style right but otherwise any resemblance between the tall, lanky, expansive Bobby Fischer and Maguire is slight. He probably didn&apos;t see enough footage of Fischer at that age. He didn&apos;t use any of Fischer&apos;s mannerisms that I noticed and of course Fischer was several inches taller. Liev Schreiber who played Spassky actually looks a bit like Spassky but is bigger and more robust. So we have in the movie Fischer vs. Spassky at the chess board but Spassky bigger than Fischer! As for games mentioned in some detail I had to go back to the first and sixth games of the match to recall what happened and to compare my perception with that of the commentary in the movie. The sixth game was a brilliant game as almost everybody agrees, but contrary to some popular opinion Fischer did not blunder away his bishop in game one. He and Spassky were in a clearly drawn bishop and pawn ending. He wanted more, but there was nothing he could do, so what he did was sacrifice his bishop for two pawns, not as some people think in an attempt to win the game but to show his confidence and to shake Spassky up a bit. Fischer thought the resulting position after many moves would be a draw. He was wrong but this is an example of Fischer psychology: I will make you play a hundred moves if necessary just to show you how strong I am. You will weaken not me.\n\nSome reviewers pointed out some chessic type errors but there weren&apos;t that many and they were minor. Here&apos;s one they got right that may surprise some people. Notice that Fischer used the descriptive notation (&quot;P-K4&quot;) while most other grandmasters even back in 1972 used algebraic notation (&quot;e4&quot;). And while there were chess clock on analyst boards where they serve no purpose at least the boards were set up right with the white square at the player&apos;s right hand, avoiding a common error in movies.\n\nProbably the biggest error had nothing to do with chess but with the fact that Fischer&apos;s mental illness at the time of the Spassky match had not developed as much as the movie suggests. His personality was more rounded than displayed. He actually had a charming side. People liked him in spite his bad manners and selfishness. There&apos;s a YouTube video of him on TV with Bob Hope filmed sometime shortly after the match with Spassky that shows a very different Fischer than the one Maguire portrayed.\n\nThe bit with the girl (sarcastically she says to Fischer: &quot;it was good for me too&quot; as he studies a chess game in bed) was apparently director Edward Zwick&apos;s take on the nagging question of Fischer&apos;s sexuality, meaning yes he was heterosexual, but chess was just more interesting.\n\nThe real disappointment for me was that they did not make clear the really great triumphant of Fischer&apos;s preceding the championship match. He destroyed three of the top grandmasters en route to the title match, at one point winning 20 games in a row. Amazing. The greatest streak in grandmaster history. So he was a clear favorite although Spassky was the World Champion. That&apos;s why he wanted so much to win the first game and confirm immediately that he was clearly superior.\n\nI was also disappointed that Fischer&apos;s life after winning the championship was not explored. I had hoped for a cinematic take on what happened to &quot;The Wandering King&quot; (the title of a book about his life by Hans Bohm and Kees Jongkind). Perhaps that material would be better presented in a documentary than in a popular flick.\n\nBottom line: worth seeing but not as good as I had hoped.\n\n--Dennis Littrell, author of &quot;The World Is Not as We Think It Is&quot;",

This just fell flat honestly. I was pretty excited to watch this too, so I am disappointed it fell so flat. Also it focused more on the humans than it did on the Troll and characters acted so corny I wanted to rip my eyes out, I mean God sometimes they were so cringe. Sorry, but this was very disappointing and gets 4 stars from me and that&apos;s just because I liked the scenes the troll was in. (On a sidenote... The Troll could&apos;ve been more ferocious, but that&apos;s just a personal taste)",

      "reviewBody": "I grew up watching the old Inspector Gadget cartoon as a kid. It was like Get Smart for kids. Bumbling boob can&apos;t solve any case and all the work is done by the walking talking dog Brain and his niece Penny. I had heard the live action movie was decent so I checked it out at the library. I rented this movie for free and felt I should have been paid to see this.\n\nBroderick comes nowhere near the caliber of acting Don Adams had as the voice of gadget. His voice was all wrong. The girl who played Penny looked nothing like the cartoon Penny. She is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails. But she does do a decent job given what she had to work with. Dabney Coleman gives a good performance as Cheif Quimby. Saldy he never hid in any odd place or had exploding messages tossed at him accidently by Gadget.\n\nThe gadget mobile was wrong. It never talked in the series and it did fine. Why did they do this?\n\nGadget was too intelligent in this film. In the show he was a complete idiot. Here he had a halfway decent intellect. It would have worked better if he was a moron.\n\nAlso the completely butchered the catchphrase. Borderick says &quot;Wowser&quot;. It is and should always be &quot;Wowsers&quot;. It sounds lame with out the &apos;s&apos;. I got upset when they showed the previews and they didn&apos;t have the correct phrase.\n\nThe ONLY decent gags were during the credits. The lacky for Claw is in front of a support group for recovering henchmen/sidekicks. Seated in the audience is Mr. T, Richard Keil aka Jaws of Bond movie fame, a Herve Villacheze look alike, Oddjob, Kato and more. This is about the only part I laughed at.\n\n The other is at the end where Penny is checking out here gadget watch and tells brain to say somethin. Don Adams voices the dog saying that &quot;Brain isn&apos;t in right now. Please leave your name at the sound of the woof. Woof.&quot; of course this isn&apos;t laugh out loud funny, just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie. He should have at least voiced the stupid car.\n\nKids will like this, anyone over 13 won&apos;t.",

      "reviewBody": "This a rough, edgy film but the interesting characters make it entertaining for the full two hours. For some reason, I don&apos;t believe this film got a lot of publicity.\n\nKarol Roder doesn&apos;t get any billing but he&apos;s as much a star in this movie as big-names Robert Redford and Edward Burns. Another actor who also has a key role, Oleg Taktarov, has no billing! Wow, they really hosed the Eastern European actors in here.\n\nThe film is partially another indictment against the tabloid press. Playing the villain in that regard is good &apos;ole &quot;Frasier&quot; from TV: Kelsey Grammar. He plays a foul-mouthed tabloid television sleazoid &quot;Robert Hawkins.\n\nSometimes this got a bit too edgy for me, nor did I appreciate Burns&apos; verbal blasphemy, but I also enjoyed some of the black humor in here. Overall, it&apos;s not a film that, frankly, was that memorable yet I would watch it again.",
