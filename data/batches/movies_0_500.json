It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.\n\nAnd it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins&apos; best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.",

It doesn&apos;t matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the consummate optimist. He doesn&apos;t complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don&apos;t ever get to his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well.\n\nTom Hanks has become our new Jimmy Stewart. His roles are about human emotion and dedication. He is the everyman in many ways. Obviously, the subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making when it comes to film. \n\nThe other heroes are the special effects people. They are able to make this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within. The news clips are quite marvelous. I usually put this film in my top ten.",

      "reviewBody": "My oh my.  &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino&apos;s trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5."

I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson&apos;s vision was to my own.\n\nNow about the omissions and alterations. I&apos;m not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn&apos;t mind Arwen&apos;s inflation and I&apos;m actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).\n\nThe acting was flawless. As I&apos;ve read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn&apos;t play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat&apos;s off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who&apos;s intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It&apos;s EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.\n\nThe special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron&apos;s Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.\n\nWhat&apos;s wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!",

      "reviewBody": "Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling  atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a  thriller because of that.  &quot;Se7en&quot; is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right  from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and  mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It&apos;s  very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the  meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting,  or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer  Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.  Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced  and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some  obvious cliché&apos;s. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and  Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different  in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them  such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play  more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey  truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and  chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of  them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive.  Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police  captain.  The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying  scene&apos;s, this seriously ain&apos;t no kids stuff! The movie has some of the  most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it  aren&apos;t just only the gross scene&apos;s that are good, there are also some  scene&apos;s that are made with lot&apos;s of beauty and profession such as the  library scene.  Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the  ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see.  10/10",

      "reviewBody": "After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne&apos;s past. Christopher Nolan&apos;s conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan&apos;s approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that&apos;s its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman&apos;s arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman&apos;s most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman&apos;s most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in &quot;BATMAN &amp; ROBIN&quot;. Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger&apos;s posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger&apos;s performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.\n\n**** (out of four)",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; is another excellent installment in the thus far excellent trilogy. The film picks up immediately where &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum (played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary character-generation). Serkis&apos; motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character&apos;s natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them, but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living, moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill&apos;s army and his lovely niece (Mirando Otto). As all this occurs, Ian McKellen comes back and rehashes a role which seemed to have expired late in the first film. Hugo Weaving and daughter Liv Tyler know that victory is not certain and realize that they must leave their true homes forever to protect themselves and the lives of their people. Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif (of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&quot; fame). In the end not one, but two key battles will create the sure-to-be electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise&apos;s final installment (&quot;The Return of the King&quot;). Many view &quot;The Two Towers&quot; as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first (which will likely always be my favorite). This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout, while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship, love and personal sacrifice. In short, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino&apos;s most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven&apos;t hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.\n\nThen i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&amp;A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&amp;A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.\n\nSo little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.\n\nEasily Mr Tarantino&apos;s best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.\n\nYes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino&apos;s own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez&apos;s From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.\n\nWhat really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt&apos;s performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune&apos;s blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.\n\nChristoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad &amp; the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.\n\nThat every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough&apos;s Great Escape leader.\n\nAll the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger&apos;s Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.\n\nIt also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.\n\nThe film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT.",

      "reviewBody": "To start off this review I&apos;d like to go back to the original batman series. Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clichés, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman &amp; Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze &quot;You&apos;re not sending me to the cooler&quot;, wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it&apos;s a shame it didn&apos;t start off this way as it might not of died on it&apos;s rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it&apos;s not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne&apos;s past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you&apos;ve not seen it I don&apos;t want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun. D-man.",

Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director",

He pays attention to every detail in this film, making &quot;Shutter Island&quot; one of the best suspense thrillers of all time.\n\nVisually intriguing, simplistic and absolutely phenomenal. The story is kept simplistic enough so it doesn&apos;t get absurd, but allows for an ending which you probably won&apos;t see coming. The film doesn&apos;t go for cheap thrills, so although you will be on the edge of your seat you won&apos;t get needlessly scared.\n\nThe film uses everything at its disposal from breathtaking scenery, to detailed laid-out shots, and to actors at their finest to completely engross you in the film. I loved every minute of it and highly recommend it to everyone. Even if you&apos;re not a usual fan of the genre, this film has so much more to it.",

Schindler&apos;s List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there. I was embarrassed when I actually started clapping in that classroom where I first watched this movie. I&apos;d recommend it to anybody and it remains in my top selection of movies. Outstanding."

      "reviewBody": "The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography, from script to presentation, Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world&apos;s brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.\n\nTold in a narrative that jumps between various points along its time line, playing out like a magic act itself, the story is that of two magicians on the rise in their careers. The first -- played by Christian Bale -- is an expert in understanding the fundamentals of any trick, but lacks showmanship. The second -- played by Hugh Jackman -- is a master showman who is more entertaining than technical. A tragic series of events pits the two performers against each other in a battle of wits that spirals further and further out of control, consuming both of them and everything and everyone they care about.\n\nWith a story that requires actors with a great deal of emotive range, Nolan has assembled what could be described as a dream cast. Both Bale and Jackman suit their respective roles perfectly, and pitting these two performers against each other was a stroke of casting genius. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role by any lesser actor and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist Nikola Tesla absolutely shines. Add Andy Serkis to the mix, and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.\n\nThe Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery, drama, suspense and fantasy. In that, the story becomes a never-ending stream of wonder for the mind: one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next, becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters, each adding their own viewpoint to the events, and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract, the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.\n\nThe only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla&apos;s introduction (winter suddenly becomes spring/summer and back again) and a strange choice of music for the closing credits (a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky). However, neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.\n\nIn the end, the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across.",

      "reviewBody": "LA Review of &apos;The Avengers&apos; (No spoilers)\n\nI was lucky enough to attend the Marvel screening of &apos;The Avengers&apos; on Saturday morning in Century City, CA. This was an unusual screening as movies of this caliber are not screened some three weeks before it&apos;s release date. Just minutes before the movie started, we were all surprised when writer/director Joss Whedon walked in with Kevin Feige to introduced their little &quot;Justice League&quot; movie. Not only did we all laugh, but some booed. lol. If that wasn&apos;t enough of a surprise, the soft spoken Whedon introduced on stage Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson) and Cobie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill). Wow is she stunning in person! The audience gave them all a standing ovation with deafening cheers! (This explained why the secret service like security were searching, wanding everyone. No cameras, cell phones, nothing was allowed in.) What a nice surprise for an early Saturday morning screening. \n\nI&apos;ve never read comic books. This is a comic book movie. It was made for hardcore fans of comics, and I appreciate the care Joss Whedon gives to this movie. It was very entertaining to see Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury all interact with one another. \n\nCapt. Steve Rogers was fighting in WWII just yesterday. Having been recently awoken from his frozen sleep, he struggles to fit in our modern world with all this technology around us. The God of Thunder, Thor, is not from this world (realm) and doesn&apos;t understand modern technology on Earth as well. Dr. Bruce Banner has been on the run from the government, practicing medicine in third world countries. He hasn&apos;t been the Hulk in two years (What&apos;s his secret? ;). Tony Stark is still the same, playing with this high tech toys and inventing new technology. So how do you get them all to interact and play well together? Well, Director Joss Whedon is the secret to making it all work. \n\nThe highlight of the film for me is how Joss Whedon has all these characters interact. Deep character development was not needed for this film. (That is what the respective movies are for: Thor, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger) He does a great job of not forcing dialogue, and the interaction of the characters is much more organic than I would have ever anticipated. That is where Whedon deserves the most credit. He took what appears to be a very silly premise, with silly looking characters and made it completely work. Seeing as the Avengers comics date back to the 1960s, you can tell he not only did his homework, but he really cares deeply for the material, and his passion definitely shows on- screen. \n\nThe movie is vastly entertaining. The Action scenes are amazing and satisfying. Nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences. I felt as if there was not a single bad performance. A couple of dialogue lines seemed off, but once you remember who the character is, and why they talk the way they do (think of where they come from), it all makes sense. Each respective character is true and honest to itself. Each of the characters brought their personality (from their respective movie) to the table. It is by far the best Marvel movie to date.\n\nSo who was my personal favorite character from the movie? Dr. Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo) of course! He is by far the BEST Bruce Banner/Hulk since Bill Bixby. His intelligence (genius) is unparalleled (greater than Tony Stark&apos;s) and his compassion for human lives is what drives the good side of his character. As a kid growing up, he was my favorite Marvel super hero. I enjoyed watching Bill Bixby play medical doctor/physicist Dr. David Banner on television. I&apos;d watch, terrified with my hands up to my face, as he transformed into the raging green hulk. Yet i was so fascinated with him being a scientist, helping those in need. When Mark Ruffalo was first announced to play Bruce Banner, i didn&apos;t know what to think of it. I knew that he&apos;s a good actor. All he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character out of him. I really hope they make an Incredible Hulk movie sequel starring Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner. Or at least, i vote for him to reprise his role in any sequel. He was a natural fit for this role. \n\nOverall, the best thing about these characters is that they are not silly twenty-something terrible actors who were chosen for on-screen eye candy. They all do a fine job of bringing these characters to life and their chemistry together works great. Assembled, they are unstoppable. When i heard an Avengers movie was rumored to be in the works, i was ecstatic. The day has finally come. Go see it. Thrice. 10/10 Stars.",

Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite possibly the best performance of his career. Even the people who hate him admit he did a good job. It&apos;s turned some haters into fans and my brother who despises him even says he was great. Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr. Ripley and As Good As It Gets. Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the best lines. Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen are good, too.\n\nDefinitely one of the best films of the 00&apos;s. And easily one of the best remakes of all time. It&apos;s intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful, superbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most shocking scenes I&apos;ve ever seen. And there&apos;s not a boring moment in it&apos;s two and a half hour running time. \n\nThe film will most likely be nominated for picture, director and adapted screenplay, and in my opinion, it deserves all three of them. DiCaprio and Wahlberg also deserve nominations.\n\nSee this as soon as you can.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Green Mile&quot; is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King&apos;s &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; to the screen.  He does the same high quality work with &quot;The Green Mile&quot;.  The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that.  I can&apos;t understand the complaints.  The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn&apos;t feel three hours long.  The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. &quot;The Green Mile&quot; will haunt you.",

This movie benefits from the introduction of Yoda, a diminutive yet wise Jedi master who helps Luke prepare for his showdown with Darth Vader. It also introduces Lando Calrissian, Han&apos;s old gambling and smuggling buddy played very well by Billy Dee Williams. Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn&apos;t go overboard with the humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well. Despite all of this I can&apos;t really say that I enjoyed Empire more than the original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it that none of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. I&apos;d say that it is at least on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up in what is probably the greatest series of movies in the history of cinema.",

First of all to say is that the visual effects and the whole setting of this movie is absolutely unique yet and will be for a few years still, I think. The Sorrounding on &quot;Pandora&quot; doesn&apos;t let you breathe for several minutes in which you just cannot close your mouth. But this is NOT what makes this movie unique and so awesome! The story is really a great part of it, and gives the film its spirit. OK, it IS predictable, but many tiny parts that are unexpected just give it the suspense it needs. This is no &quot;switch off your brain&quot;-movie!!!\n\nIn my opinion this film is worth 9-10 stars, I&apos;m giving 10 for the goose-flesh it still gives me every time I see the trailer or hear the soundtrack. This evening I&apos;m gonna watch it again :-)\n\nPS: Sorry for my bad English, I&apos;m from Germany...",

The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis&apos;s direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "If I told you the entire plot of this film it really wouldn&apos;t matter as it is an exquisite paean to the subjectivity of memory and therefore is in itself ambiguous; the truth&apos; of it is up to you. You come out of the cinema questioning yourself, your memories, your truths. Nothing in this film is as it seems, and yet paradoxically everything is as it seems. We see everything through Guy Pearce&apos;s characters&apos; (Lenny) eyes, unfortunately he has no short-term memory so cannot form new memories. He would have already forgotten the first sentence of this review. He lives in snapshots of life; his only form of memory is his Polaroid camera, just like in the excellent German film Wintersleepers; also (partly) about a short-term memory disorder.\n\nIn this film Lenny takes snapshots to remember who people are, where he now lives, his car, everything. As you can imagine this is perfect for paranoia, suspicion, uncertainty, confusion, and betrayal. And that&apos;s exactly what you get in extreme doses. The difference between this film and Wintersleepers however is that Memento is entirely from Lenny&apos;s perspective. This therefore creates an imaginative, creatively unsurpassable film. The film begins where it should end, so far so trite, but here&apos;s the beauty, we, like Guy Pearce, learn in fragments what&apos;s going on. It is therefore perfect for those who love to second guess what&apos;s going to happen, who did what, who&apos;s doing what and why. The beauty of this film though is that my interpretation could be so different from yours, and neither of us could be sure whose interpretation is the right one; if there is a right one at all. Nothing is certain, nothing is clear. Another beauty of this film is the way it is filmed and edited. Pieces are shown a number of times with no real linear link between them, just like it would be if we ourselves had a memory disorder, and then they are cut up and edited next to things that happen either before or after it. It&apos;s just like holding ten different and linearly distinct Polaroids in your hand and having a short-term memory disorder. Excellent.\n\nI&apos;m not even sure if watching it again will make things any less ambiguous, but then who cares? The ambiguity is what makes this a great film, if it wasn&apos;t so cut up, or from Lenny&apos;s perspective it would be both very short and trite; and lacking in tension, suspense and interest. But as it stands it has all three, isn&apos;t trite and says so much about humanity. Oh, and the plot? It really doesn&apos;t matter, all you need to know is that everything about this film is indicative of the subjectivity of memory, of our experiences and interpretations of all that happens to us. Nothing will seem as black and white as it did beforehand. It will make you question every memory you have, almost as much as possessing a psychology degree, as I do! So, go and see it: be confused, acknowledge the frailty of all you know to be true, and then imagine the freedom of actually being Lenny, and then the horror of having nothing, nothing but the reliance of a pen and a Polaroid camera to know who you are."

His portrayl of Cal was so evil that despite being an awful person, you couldn&apos;t help but feel sorry for him, especially when despite all his doings he loved Rose so much.\n\n James Horner&apos;s music was just as haunting and he always lifts the movie he works on to the ultimate level.\n\nKathy Bates was equally impressive in a small role and provided quite a few of the laughs of the film. \n\nEverything from the special effects, to the sets to the costumes were pure magic.\n\nThis would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th Century and one that will never be forgotten."

      "reviewBody": "The movie that dispelled the romantic myths about La Cosa Nostra and showed it as it really was.  &quot;The Godfather&quot; for the 90&apos;s minus the silly notions of love, honor, and family.  Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is a half-Irish, half-Italian who rises to prominence in Paul Cicero&apos;s (Paul Sorvino) Lucchese Crime Family along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).  This is his story of hi-jacking, stealing, cheating, killing and finally drug dealing.  He makes no excuses about what he does. Simply put he is just doing business and trying to survive on the mean streets of New York City.  He explains the trials and tribulations of being a mobster and what it&apos;s like to have to do these things and live with the consequences.  Cicero, an aging old-time underboss, heads a dangerous and powerful organization that enjoys free reign over the neighborhood in which Hill lives and recruits him when he is only a kid to work for them and learn to &quot;score&quot; more specifically, the art of committing crime.  Hill quickly hooks up with veteran criminal Jimmy &quot;The Gent&quot; and his protege Tommy to hi-jack trucks from the Idlewild Airport.  This makes these three rich and respected in the underworld but there is a new game in town.  Narcotics. They quickly undertake this highly profitable business even though they know it is against the expressed rules of Paulie.  This combined with another serious rule violation and the score of a lifetime sets them up for their own possible demise.  Lorraine Bracco co-stars as Henry&apos;s wife.  A marvelous true life story of one of the most violent and profitable street crews in the history of the American Mafia.  The best movie of 1990."

If you think this couldn&apos;t happen, just look back over the years at the stupidity of the human race and think again.\n\nJim Carrey once again nails his role, as do the entire cast. It is rare he fails to perform at a level that perfectly complements the movie and its genre. This is something he does not receive enough credit for. Acting for a comical role or a more dramatic role requires no less effort for the performance to be spot on.",

      "reviewBody": "I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children&apos;s movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can&apos;t take such movies too seriously, can one?\n\nAnd so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney &quot;adventure&quot; movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?\n\nAnd then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...\n\nI cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen &quot;Pirates&quot; four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It&apos;s like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, &quot;Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don&apos;t you?&quot;\n\nAnd that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn&apos;t Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?\n\nI am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?\n\nI often don&apos;t even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.\n\nExcept for this year.\n\nGo Jack.\n\nAnd, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected &quot;money shots&quot; this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, &quot;You&apos;d best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you&apos;re in one!&quot; and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt&apos;s pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there&apos;s the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.\n\nAnd now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking &quot;overproduced by&quot; credit on the cover-liner. &quot;Bombastic.&quot; &quot;Overdone.&quot; &quot;Absurdly Stupendous.&quot;\n\nWell, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.\n\nOnce again, the children were wondering, &quot;What&apos;s up with Daddy? Is he OK?&quot;\n\nPerhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, &quot;Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho&quot; and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.\n\nAt this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.\n\nThis is not just another &quot;entry&quot; in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot; I do hope Depp&apos;s performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure. I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me.",

      "reviewBody": "Who says popular films are not and cannot be art? If anything is proof that popular films can be of a stunningly high quality, the beauty of the animation, writing, music, and sound design in &quot;WALL·E&quot; is it. &quot;WALL·E&quot; eclipses even Andrew Stanton&apos;s &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; in the Pixar pantheon, is perhaps Pixar&apos;s best film to date and, call me crazy as I&apos;ve just seen it, a contender for the title of best animated film, period.\n\n&quot;WALL·E&quot; is everything we&apos;ve come to expect from Pixar and more- colorful, vibrant, imaginative, exciting, involving, beautiful, and most importantly a film with interesting, involving characters. Sure, WALL·E is adorable, and as much credit as the animators get for that, this film would be nothing without Stanton&apos;s screenplay, which features very little dialogue but is still notably intelligent and surprisingly subtle, making a refreshing change from the &apos;go green&apos; campaigns we&apos;re all so used to. Does &quot;WALL·E&quot; have a message? Sure, but it&apos;s an important message and it is delivered subtly and beautifully.\n\n&quot;WALL·E&quot; operates on two levels (and works spectacularly well on both). It is a majestic science fiction epic like we haven&apos;t seen in a couple of decades and it is a genuinely touching and never cheap romance. &quot;WALL·E&quot; will never get points for originality but it doesn&apos;t exactly need them because the homages to great films and figures of the past- Chaplin, Keaton, Tati, the Marx Brothers, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (this one is particularly spectacular), &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; are actually homages and not ripoffs. &quot;WALL·E&quot; is a wonderful tribute to a bygone cinematic tradition (well, two or three of them actually). \n\nThe social commentary in &quot;WALL·E&quot; is sobering because it&apos;s never overbearing and most importantly because we see the world through machines, machines who feel more about Earth and life than the humans do. The depiction of humans on the ship could have been incredibly offensive, cheap, and tasteless in concept but the execution here is absolutely perfect.\n\nWhat is most surprising about &quot;WALL·E&quot; is how sad it is. Not even in the &apos;how will they get out of this, oh I feel so sorry for them&apos; way &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, a previous Stanton effort, is, but in a truly melancholy sense. The early portion of the film maintains all the playfulness of a Jacques Tati film but also evokes a striking and powerful feeling of loneliness. It&apos;s a brilliant introduction to WALL·E, given that the rest of the film is too wacky to bother with long scenes focused entirely on character, and works beautifully with the ugly yet beautifully-rendered future Earth, a barren wasteland filled with nothing but garbage, a seriously resilient cockroach being WALL·E&apos;s only companion before EVE shows up, but I won&apos;t go into the story- it&apos;s best you see it unfold for yourself.\n\nFrom the entertaining shorts shown before the film to the memorable characters, locations, and animation we have come to expect, Pixar films are now event cinema, and they have outdone themselves with &quot;WALL·E&quot;. This film is spectacular, majestic, touching, involving, and achingly beautiful. Most importantly, however, it is perfect entertainment. I may be saying this too soon, but I don&apos;t think I have ever seen an animated film that has satisfied me more than &quot;WALL·E&quot;, and 2008 is going to have to work hard to keep this from being the top film of the year, which it most certainly is at the moment.\n\n9.5/10"

      "reviewBody": "When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you&apos;ve seen it, you know you&apos;ve seen something.\n\nA few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her &quot;typical teenager&quot; role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari&apos;s character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His &quot;purpose&quot; in the film, unlike anyone else&apos;s, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.\n\nMost films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to &quot;move&quot; its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life, no matter how predictable or tacky it appears, this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives, so therefore, when they are over, we each have something to remember.",

      "name": "the best action film of all time, and NOT due to the CGI",
      "reviewBody": "Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers arthouse-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you&apos;re not able to take a few sci-fi leaps of faith, ignore this review, as well. We&apos;ll both be better off.\n\nThis is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it&apos;s not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1991!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used.\n\nThis movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CG. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.\n\nBut, a little bit of background is due. This is the sequel to the Terminator (1984), whose premise was that a near-indestructible cyborg is sent by evil self-aware machines from the near future to destroy the mother-to-be of the military commander who would lead the humans to a victory over the machines. Oh, and this terminator machine would come from a time of war between men and machines which followed a nuclear exchange that left billions of people dead, first. In Terminator 2, John Connor (the commander-to-be) is about 12 years old, and his mother (Sarah) is feverishly trying to prepare him for his fate, even as she tries to stop the factors that will lead to the nuclear war and the entire terrible future that made all this necessary. The machines now send a superior, more intelligent, shape-shifting cyborg (T1000) into the past, to kill John himself. Meanwhile, future-John reprograms the ex-evil Terminator (T101) from the original film, and sends him into the past to PROTECT John against the T1000.\n\nThat&apos;s your basic plot. It does involve travel into the past, so it immediately presents a time-travel paradox which can&apos;t really be resolved. In order to even try watching this movie, you MUST LOOK PAST THE PARADOX. If you don&apos;t, this movie has zero credibility, and is not worth your time.\n\nWhat happens after the two terminators appear in the past is a wild ride rife with macho action, dark reflection on the nature of man, and a few rays of hope, here and there. Schwarzenegger (the good terminator) and Patrick (the bad one) make for such effective foes that the times they meet on-screen are completely breathtaking (and odd, given that you repeatedly see the relatively slim T1000 through Arnie through a wall or two). Hamilton, as Sarah Connor, is a wonderful character -- tough beyond all belief and completely focussed on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John&apos;s safety, yet clearly a little out of her mind with paranoia and anger; amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson&apos;s house to prevent her from doing what she wants to) in her otherwise 2-dimensional character. And Furlong, as John, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who&apos;s confused by the fact that everyone except his mom tell him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well, particularly Earl Boen who plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).\n\nWith these players set in motion, it&apos;s up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they&apos;re evenly spaced through the movie. I mean, who doesn&apos;t cheer (at least inside) when Arnold steps out of the biker bar, fully clad in leather when &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; music starts to blast? The guy absolutely bleeds coolness. And the T1000 absolutely bleeds evil. But, with so many great moments, you&apos;d think the pacing would be a little uneven... not really! The film shifts from place to place with an ease that makes perfect sense, never giving you the time to start being a little nitpicking jerk, always driving forward, but always doing so thoughtfully and with attention to detail.\n\nOf course, this wouldn&apos;t be an action movie without some action. There&apos;s plenty of it, and it&apos;s perfectly done. The CG effects for the shape-shifting T1000 were cutting-edge for the time, and still look great (whoever said differently below is simply incorrect) -- even if they&apos;re completely commonplace today. The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, a helicopter flies under a highway overpass; at another, a motorcycle jumps from the 2nd floor of a building into a flying chopper). (Probably, only the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings movies compare in terms of the level of stunt insanity.) And the gunplay is delivered in perfect Cameron-Schwarzenegger style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you&apos;ll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you&apos;ll see them used well. The film is violent, and somewhat bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans: sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable -- just wait until the nuclear detonation sequence.\n\nI&apos;m not sure what else you would want in a movie. Probably moral content, and the movie has a very clear pro-human, anti-war message. The message is a bit stale, and the delivery IS, at times, a little heavy-handed (and some moments with the T101 seem just a bit unrealistic, towards the end), but the movie has heart, and that you cannot deny. Plus, it simply rocks. 10/10",

The movie however turned out to be extremely powerful mainly due to the professionalism it was made with.\n\nThe movie its story is told &apos;beautifuly&apos; in black &amp; white and color. The quite original directing from Tony Kaye gives the movie a nice visual style and certain atmosphere. The story itself isn&apos;t that complicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points even predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. This is not a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to the racial discrimination problems. It shows what is NOT the solution to the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious circle. The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you&apos;re causing to yourself and your close environment when you&apos;re thinking as a white supremacist.\n\nAs an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful. I think that its a really good and important thing that this movie is often shown in classrooms.\n\nEdward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It&apos;s almost like he&apos;s playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene&apos;s are highly believable as two brothers.\n\nAlso surprising good was the musical score by Anne Dudley who had already won an Oscar for &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, the year before.\n\nThis was a movie that surprisingly impressed me. As a movie its extremely powerful and important.\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.\n\nNever have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it&apos;s a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It&apos;s bad enough that the studios can&apos;t seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone&apos;s prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don&apos;t think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It&apos;s a film that fans wanted and got.\n\nI can&apos;t imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he&apos;s the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.\n\nThe writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn&apos;t expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it&apos;s done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it&apos;s self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.\n\nI&apos;m so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don&apos;t know the character at all.",

Just when you think you know all, they pull the rug from under you, and make you think again. Direction is taut, the script is impressive.\n\nI would argue this is one of Spacey&apos;s best ever performances, if not the best of the lot, he is phenomenal here, and really does stand out in a crowd of immense talent, hopefully he&apos;ll get his career back on track.\n\nGabriel Byrne and Pete Postlethwaite shine, as does Stephen Baldwin, a time where that handsome brotherhood seemed to pop up everywhere, but he was excellent also.\n\nIt&apos;s a super slick production, with some pretty fine special effects, and good use of pyrotechnics, a polished production, one that&apos;s not overdone.\n\nThis is one of those movies that you can watch and watch again, it simply doesn&apos;t diminish or lose any of its intrigue. You know there&apos;s a twist coming, you&apos;ll sit there waiting for it, and the first time round your jaw may drop, it&apos;s a very well delivered moment. The ending of this film is fabulous.\n\n10/10.",

The story of the adventures of an old man and a young boy, a flying house tethered to countless balloons, a long-lost (and mad) explorer, a giant bird called Kevin and assorted &apos;talking&apos; dogs gets funnier and more exciting as it goes along.\n\nThis isn&apos;t slapstick humour, although there are some lovely visual gags, but deeper, more thoughtful. At times Up is even touching and poignant.\n\nVisually, this is a treat and while I was sceptical about the use of 3D to begin with, it is built into the story so seamlessly that it really is worth the effort to seek it out. At the same time, I can&apos;t help feeling the 2D version could be even better because the 3D glasses had the effect of dimming the picture. The use of colour in the film is especially noteworthy, with various palettes used according to mood, character and phase of the story. Character voicing and music are also spot on.\n\nI have no connection with Pixar, Disney or the film whatsoever, even if this review reads like a puff piece. The fact is, Up is an incredible piece of cinema, was a big hit with a very demanding press audience, and is worthy of your time and money.\n\nAnyone who says animated films cannot amuse and entertain, while at the same time delivering any kind of emotion, does not know what they are talking about.\n\nUp is so good I can now forgive Pixar for Cars!"

Jon Favreau, the guy that had done Elf and Zathura (the Zumanji sequel) had just started a cinematic revolution? What!?!? (And Favreau is doing it again with The Mandalorian).\n\nRobert Downey Jr. was made for the part of Tony Stark. The origin story was modernized and handled well. They included most of the early Iron Man suits from the comics. They took the time showing the more modern invention of the suit and the challenges of making it work (e.g. maneuvering with the repulsors).\n\nI finally understood what Spiderman&apos;s fans felt like when Sam Raimi&apos;s Spiderman series became a massive pop culture sensation years earlier. Fantastic!\n\nThere are issues. Pacing mostly. Jeff Bridges is too much the stereotypical villain with an over-the-top fight scene at the end.\n\nThis was the beginning of the MCU world building effort which was more &quot;slight-of-hand&quot; in the earlier movies -- Stark&apos;s OCD making itself evident, that Shield guy at the party, and Samuel Jackson pinging Stark about Avengers in the end credits.\n\nIt began and ended with Iron Man.

      "reviewBody": "What a terrific piece of film-making! From the charming animated title sequence (featuring John Williams&apos;s delightfully sneaky score) to the end, this is an enormously entertaining film from the gifted craftsman, Steven Spielberg, who is so damn good people take him for granted or resent his &quot;manipulation,&quot; i.e. his seemingly effortless ability to create effective drama.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio (in his best performance that I&apos;ve seen) stars as Frank Abagnale, Jr., a real-life teen-aged con man so spectacularly gifted that he was able to steal millions from various companies with forged checks, while successfully impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, among other guises. He is chased by a rigidly rule-bound F.B.I. agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who is at first comically out-classed by the young improvising criminal genius; but the agent is steadfast and relentless and has the law on his side. The movie is filled with delightful supporting performances, starting with Hanks and continuing on with Nathalie Baye as the boy&apos;s selfish mother, Amy Adams as his immature fiancée and on down to the tiniest role. I&apos;m especially grateful for the sympathetic part given to Christopher Walken, as the mischievous and spirited Abagnale Sr., whose life darkens as his fortunes fall. Walken is one of my favorite actors, but while I enjoy the occasional one-dimensional freak or villain he plays, I wish most of his parts were like this.\n\nSpielberg&apos;s movie is rich with fascinating details and memorable incidents, while the script by Jeff Nathanson moves backward and forward in time to tell the story in the most engrossing way possible. This is top-notch entertainment."

It is a slow-burner, but I think this was purposefully done and it added to the film&apos;s poignancy and psychological aspect.\n\nGood Will Hunting is a beautifully filmed movie with striking scenery, and it is directed wonderfully by Van Sant. The music is never obtrusive but never too low-key either, while the story is interesting and compelling and the script intelligently written.\n\nThe acting is one of the film&apos;s best assets, as well as its compellingly real characters. Robin Williams is superb in one of his best &quot;drama&quot; roles, while Ben Affleck has never been better and Matt Damon gives another fine performance to match his performance in The Talented Mr Ripley. Minnie Driver is also quite touching and believable.\n\nAll in all, an incredible movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Michel Gondry, credited as the director and co-writer of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is only partly responsible for the success that the film achieves. He implements a awe-inspiring blend of style to a story that is perfectly non-linear. But then there is also the madman genius of the current screen writing plane- Charlie Kaufman- who has written three of the most ingenious, funny, and human of &quot;little&quot; Hollywood movies (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind). \n\nHe understands, and perhaps likely experienced to a degree, what a relationship holds to- the truth, to understanding, and then when it ends, how out memory changes the relationship. Enter in the concept that makes &apos;Eternal Sunshine&apos; something of a un-official science fiction film - the Lacuna corporation, led by Tom Wilkinson&apos;s character, can erase just one person out of your memory, all of the experiences that you and the significant other had. So, when Joel (Jim Carrey) goes in to erase his memory of Clementine (Kate Winslet) after finding out she did just the same, he enters into a mind-warp. He goes through memories they had, happy ones, sad ones, some that are just what makes up what you have emotionally with the one you&apos;ve loved. And sometimes, and to the behest of the assistants of Lacuna (Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo), Joel doesn&apos;t want them all to be erased.\n\nAs I mentioned, the plot is non-linear, which could&apos;ve gone the wrong way if not done with skill. With a film like 21 Grams, which has a talented director and cast, the non-linear structure isn&apos;t necessary. But it&apos;s an asset that the story doesn&apos;t start from A to Z. To assist Gondry with this, he has the extraordinary Ellen Kuras as DP and Valdís Óskarsdóttir, an editor from Iceland. Their collaboration is crucial with Gondry and Kaufman (and co-writer Pierre Bismuth), as they bring all of these un-real images a real quality. Quite simply, there isn&apos;t a finer example of surrealism crossbred with realism in any other American film so far this year. The usage of lights, cuts, and with the kinds of special effects not expected (i.e. no CGI), add to the effect it has on a viewer. That the characters of Joel and Clementine are as enveloping as they are is also a credit to Kaufman.\n\nBut then there&apos;s one more part that completes the success of the film - the acting. Jim Carrey, very simply, is at his very best. He finds a balance from certain scenes in being like people we see everyday, feeling low, not much of interest, inward. And then when the memory erases begin, we get to see him act funny, but not like the kind of humor he brought with Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber. This is Carrey knowing this character just well enough to play off his counterpart, played by Winslet. She, meanwhile, is perhaps at her best. Her character is eccentric, funny, insightful, and wanting. She pulls it off. As do the supporting actors.\n\nThere&apos;s not much more I can say about this film, except to say that even after seeing it three times, I feel like I could watch it over and over and see a new shot, a new sequence, and new set of emotions tied to things. It&apos;s one of the great romantic dramedies of the decade.",

Soon a psychotic killer (Javier Bardem) is after him while a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to figure out what&apos;s going on. I&apos;ll start off by saying that I&apos;m not a big fan of the Coen brothers. With that out of the way, this is certainly the best movie I&apos;ve seen from them but it goes downhill very quickly in the final thirty-minutes, which are quite horrid to be honest. However, everything before that is masterfully done with a beautiful craft that makes this familiar story come off very original, dark and at times funny. I really enjoyed the slow pace that the film carries but I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s how I should describe it. The movie has plenty of graphic violence and action and what makes it so shocking is that it usually comes out of no where or happens when you don&apos;t expect it. The pace of the film is slow but this helps when the violence breaks out. The performances are all terrific with Bardem stealing the show as the psychotic killer. Whenever he&apos;s on screen you can&apos;t take your eyes off of him and his silent performance speaks more than any words could. I was also very impressed with Brolin who I&apos;m usually hit and miss on. Woody Harrelson has a few nice scenes and Tommy Lee Jones is the old Tommy Lee Jones we all love. The film was a lot of fun until the conclusion, which I thought was quite awful."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s hard to get your head around the fact that &apos;Reservoir Dogs&apos; has been around for ten years. It&apos;s almost difficult to remember a time before Tarantino made such an enormous impact (good and bad) on movies, but I saw this movie first time round before the hype. All I knew was that, like another &quot;dog&quot; movie from the same era that I saw, &apos;Man Bites Dog&apos;, that it was supposed to be violent, funny and disturbing, and that it starred a long time favourite of mine Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth, who I mainly knew from Greenaway&apos;s &apos;The Cook The Thief His Wife &amp; Her Lover&apos;. Okay, I hope it&apos;s good I thought as I waited in the cinema listening to some half remembered 70s A.M. pop and a strange conversation about Madonna&apos;s sex life (the cinema was playing the soundtrack album before the main feature, but what did we know). Then the movie itself, electrifying and fascinating from the word go. It&apos;s impossible to describe the impact of seeing this for the first time without knowing what to expect! Still one of my greatest movie memories. Ten years later I&apos;ve seen it countless times so the surprise has obviously worn off, but it is still a brilliant movie because beneath the violence and wise-cracks of Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi - &apos;In The Soup&apos;), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen - &apos;Thelma &amp; Louise&apos;), and Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn - &apos;At Close Range&apos;), there is a lot of  depth, that being the very human relationship between Mr. White (Keitel) and Mr.Orange (Roth). To me that is one of the things that elevates this above the many lame and unoriginal &quot;Tarantinoesque&quot; movies we&apos;ve had to endure since &apos;Pulp Fiction&apos;. His imitators just simply don&apos;t have a clue!\n\nSimply brilliant cinema, and a modern classic. This is absolutely essential viewing!"

True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg&apos;s magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I&apos;ve seen with great acting by children. Spielberg&apos;s camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs&apos; &quot;interaction&quot; with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed. And, best of all, like star wars you can analyze the movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride.",

      "reviewBody": "Andy&apos;s toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy&apos;s top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy&apos;s new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.\n\nGiven how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.\n\nThe plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz&apos;s turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult&apos; wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.\n\nLooking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It&apos;s hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.\n\nOverall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!"

The story follows a Scottish peasant named William Wallace who&apos;s pushed into leading a rebellion against the tyranny of English rule when his wife is murdered. Starring Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, and Brendan Gleeson, the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances. Additionally, the battle sequences are remarkably gritty and violent, which adds to the authentic tone of the film. And, composer James Horner provides a sweeping and majestic score that&apos;s incredibly powerful. A groundbreaking film, Braveheart does an exceptional job at depicting both the valor and the horror of war.",

Night Shyamalam\n\nAs a film which has undoubtedly caught the eye of the film going world, it was difficult to avoid the surrounding hype and publicity. Luckily most of the people I had spoken to who had seen the film did not spoil the &apos;twist&apos; at the end, which, although is rather a laboured point by now in reviews, certainly adds to the &quot;Oh, I see now&quot; factor.\n\nThe story revolves around a child psychologist played characteristically by Bruce Willis. I say characteristically, because although his portrayal is quite real, and at times touching, there always seems to be an unnerving &apos;Die Hard&apos;-ness to his speech, lending the dialogue some comical qualities. Having said that, his overall attempts at revealing the vulnerable and disturbed psyche of his character achieve good results. As the psychologist, he is plagued by a particular event in his professional life which he perceives as his personal failure, and sets out to redeem himself by righting the wrong and wiping his failure from his conscience. This opportunity presents itself to him in the form of Cole Sear, played devastatingly well by Hayley Joel Osment. Cole has a problem, he sees dead people. To the outside world he is seen as a loner, a problem child, and has become increasingly isolated. Hence the need for a child psychologist. Once we have been introduced to these two central players, we are taken on a journey of discovery, as both of these characters in the space of the film will learn a great deal about each other, themselves and human nature.\n\nIt is this particular point which the film attempts to address so strongly - human communication. That when this breaks down, an inevitable cycle of interpersonal destruction takes course, sometimes irreversible. This is framed within the context of a superbly told ghost story. The sheer truthfulness and honesty with which the concept of fear is expressed by all the characters, is breathtaking. Cole&apos;s&apos; experience of the walking dead, appearing out of nowhere, Malcolm&apos;s fear of a deteriorating marriage, and Cole&apos;s&apos; mother&apos;s fear relating to her own existential angst. All of these are played against the backdrop of the often difficult but finally warm relationship between Cole and Malcolm. Eventually, and against the odds, each character displays courage and bravery as they face up to their existential and supernatural fears.\n\nThere are one or two niggling problems plot wise, but in a film where the overall atmosphere created is one which encompasses death, fear, and finally hope, it is impossible not to overlook incongruencies. Superb direction, acting and ambience lead me to think that M. Night Shyamalan has really succeeded in telling a chillingly touching story about the triumph of the human spirit.\n\nFebruary 14, 2000 Harshad C. Keval"

      "reviewBody": "A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the &apos;marks&apos;. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.\n\nThe later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the &apos;con&apos; itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the &apos;truth&apos; as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.\n\nThere is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition, but it is a handsome, clever film and the timing in the year is right - I don&apos;t see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture, but this is more to do with the system than with the film. Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative."

      "name": "An important hardened lesson in resilience and when to stop measuring up to your mentor. Whiplash is a captivating study of ambition.",
      "reviewBody": "Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January, Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd-pleasing intensity. On the surface, it&apos;s a gritty story about a brutal student-mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries. Underneath, it&apos;s a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition. Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing. As a result, it&apos;s the best film I&apos;ve seen in years, and I say that without hesitation. This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts. If writer/director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist, then he has achieved it. \n\nMiles Teller, who&apos;s been steadily growing on me since The Spectacular Now, stars as Andrew Neyman, a 19-year-old aspiring jazz drummer who&apos;s pushed and inspired by the abuse and aspirations of his school band leader Fletcher, played by the ferocious J.K. Simmons like we&apos;ve never seen him before. Chazelle has described the film as an origin story to the jazz musicians of the golden age, and it thrives on the myths of jazz heroes such as Charlie Parker. They&apos;re urgently looking for the next Parker, in search of perfection. But with that comes a great irony. The music genre is known as one for freedom of expression but here the jazz is soulless and mechanical, and that clouds the ethical judgment of the characters. Even so, Fletcher is a man who can tell if you have the right tempo within a bar. Although most of the audience for the film may not know much about music including myself, you get a feel for what he&apos;s looking for and when someone&apos;s wrong even if you don&apos;t know why. Simmons is as good as they say he is. He&apos;s a force of nature, with a terrifying presence that incites the fear Bryan Cranston achieved with the peak of his Walter White. But it&apos;s not a one-note performance. Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness, insecurity, approachability, and he also sometimes brings in the lightness he&apos;s known for in other roles with Jason Reitman, exec producer here. \n\nEven though he&apos;s an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say, he&apos;s still somewhat endearing and enigmatic, much like R. Lee Ermey&apos;s drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. This demasculinisation through a barrage of insults is a theme explored in Whiplash and it argues whether it&apos;s a crime or an &apos;ends justifying the means&apos; factor of life. It&apos;s not just a music film, but also one that adapts to the elements of sports training, war at boot camp and biopic genres with the way it frames its elements. Fletcher is representative of the devil on our shoulders that yells at us that we&apos;re not good enough and that symbolic idea resonates deeply for me. His poisonous words are more a part of Andrew&apos;s psyche than legitimate coaching techniques. What grabs me about the film is its discussion on artistic perfection, and especially in these intimate and rough sequences of practicing. What is objectively great in art? When is it good enough, and why? It toes a fascinating line. That&apos;s why drumming is such an interesting choice for the film to explore because it&apos;s so instinctive. Drummers have to make decisions within a fraction of a second and talent can only take you so far. The roaring beat in Whiplash puts your heart in your throat. Teller&apos;s performance as Andrew is terrific, one to match Simmons. \n\nChazelle is committed on expressing the physicality of drumming and Teller captures it exhaustively without feeling contrived. It&apos;s the virtuosity of the writing that allows us into Andrew&apos;s head however. It&apos;s a long road to the top, but the script makes the right decision to allow him to revel in the little moments of success, but then to immediately test him in surprising and involving ways. Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point. While the film is a gripping experience nonetheless, in retrospect perhaps it is too bitingly cynical. It does suggest that you have to be deprived of a meaningful relationship to achieve your goals. It does appear to be very anti-positive reinforcement, but perhaps it&apos;s merely a statement on the abundant sheltering that the latest generation is enduring. Whiplash is refreshing to see, we all know we wouldn&apos;t be resilient enough to take that kind of punishment so it&apos;s cathartic to watch Andrew go through it all and see how far he&apos;ll go. His frustration, regrets, fear and rage with himself cuts to the core of the human condition as he&apos;s pushed further and further. \n\nThe technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography. It&apos;s thoroughly impressive that the film was shot in only 19 days for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements. There&apos;s a refreshing brevity to the film with its sharp atmosphere, but it&apos;s so rich in emotion, psychological tension and personal subtext. It neither rushes nor drags, on paper nor on screen. It really is a film that lingers in your mind for days, nagging you, like Fletcher over your shoulder. Maybe it&apos;ll continue to linger for weeks. I hope so too, especially for Oscar voters. It seems that J.K. Simmons is building momentum to be a lock for Best Supporting Actor at this point. However, Whiplash isn&apos;t just a best of year film, nor best of decade. It approaches best of all-time worthy with its identifiable themes of meticulous work ethics, fulfilling aspirations, resilience of the soul, and knowing when to no longer measure yourself to your mentor. I&apos;ll take this film with me for a while as a screaming motivator.\n\n10/10. Best film of the decade.\n\nRead more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV, DVD and big screen. My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out (as Indy films always do). Luckily for me and my pal, we got the last 2 tickets available! I can&apos;t think of many films that still sell-out 25 years after their original release. There&apos;s just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.\n\nThe only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the cliché and mention 1930&apos;s serials, Tom Selleck or the sword/gun fight.\n\nI will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it&apos;s the other way around? Well, no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey and Donald in Carl Bank&apos;s Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you&apos;ll surely notice the similarities.\n\nThe hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.\n\nThe action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he&apos;s a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies.\n\nYou might think that it&apos;s rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of &apos;Indy&apos; signature sound to them, that I&apos;ve not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William&apos;s classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars! \n\nI&apos;m not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there&apos;s already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There&apos;s talk of a fourth movie at the moment, but I personally don&apos;t think it will happen and I don&apos;t want it to. It&apos;s perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there&apos;s the Young Indiana Jones TV show (where are the DVDs?), which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).\n\nI am giving Raiders 9/10 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 10/10 movie). Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.\n\nNow there&apos;s something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh, where did all the special movies go?",

It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.\n\nI could go on about the particulars of the adaptation -- the ridiculousness of the entire Capital setting, or the sometimes disorienting shakycam work, or the great cast of adults patiently playing supporting characters -- or the source material -- the gestures at social commentary, the way that the story protects Katniss from ever having to morally sully herself -- but they all seem to be beside the point. Look. The movie has the things that happened in the book, but in a movie, competently shot and acted, with absolutely no risks taken. If you liked the book, or want to learn what this whole Hunger Games thing is about without having to read the book, you&apos;ll probably like this. It&apos;s a digestible film, even an enjoyable one, but in the end it&apos;s not really interesting or memorable. But to be fair, it wasn&apos;t meant to be.",

Let&apos;s hope the edits are sufficient this time.\n\nYou already know that this is the usual Pixar fare, which is to say that it is excellent, better than any non-Pixar animated film. Sure, you also know that and you probably know the usual reason given: that Pixar spends more time on basic storytelling values than anyone else.\n\nHere are two elements of this that may deepen your appreciation. The first is that Pixar recognized early that 3D animation software allowed two types of advance in the third dimension. The first is obvious, that everything has depth and reflection and shadow more or less like reality.\n\nThe second is that once these objects and scenes are defined in the computer, it is no extra work to move the camera anywhere. it can loop and swoop in ways that we never could have before. Pixar decided to exploit this in their storytelling here and later in &quot;Nemo.&quot;\n\nNemo was set in an environment where there was no horizon so the camera could flow and the watery feel of the place could make the unfamiliar fluidity of the camera seem more natural. Here, is where they tested some of those perspectives in the three dimensional door warehouse and the extra dimensions of going in and out. Those scenes make this for me.\n\nThe second interesting thing is some competitive background. In those days, there was a shooting war between Bill Gates, financier of Dreamworks Animation (and leader of Microsoft) and Steve Jobs of Pixar (and leader of Apple). This was in the heyday of Gates&apos; dirty tricks and he was intent on burying Jobs forever. Pixar depended on the success of &quot;A Bug&apos;s Life&quot; their followon to &quot;Toy Story,&quot; so Dreamworks rushed &quot;Antz&quot; -- a cheapy -- to open a week or so before to steal the market.\n\n&quot;Bugs&quot; prevailed, sufficiently at least, and Pixar ramped up for their usual three year development of &quot;Monsters.&quot; Dreamworks, getting wind of this, went all out with &quot;Shrek,&quot; their &quot;monster&quot; movie that could be released six months earlier. It only took a year because the animation is less perfect. But they were overt in their attack this time: &quot;Shrek&quot; made literal fun of Disney, the Pixar partner. The head guy at Disney was the model for the blowhard King who reigned over a fairytale kingdom populated with -- can you guess? -- all the old Disney characters.\n\nPixar/Jobs would never do something so spiteful. But perhaps they did subtly appreciate the use of windows and gates to the future that always seemed to go wrong. And now you can too.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

Ron Howard does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character, and making the audience experience the reality of mental illness.  This could have been an unbelievable story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial mastery Howard exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Nash on his journey and awareness of his illness.  Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject.  Howard is able to portray all the complex reactions to mental illness while maintaining the humanity and dignity of the patient.

      "reviewBody": "I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they&apos;re all so great and magical. But I didn&apos;t think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!\n\nThe whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. \n\nThe cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she&apos;ll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.\n\nWe all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don&apos;t like past Harry Potter films.",

      "reviewBody": "Currently this movie is sitting at an 8.4 on IMDb. Even with the &quot;new movie effect&quot;, that score is pretty ludicrous.\n\nWhen I left the cinema, I said to my wife, &quot;I wouldn&apos;t give this movie anything more than a very generous 7&quot;. Since then some of the post-theatre-euphoria has worn off and the more I actually think about this movie, the lower the score becomes.\n\nThere are several reasons for this: the plot is derivative, I didn&apos;t care about any of the new characters, the characters that I DID care about, I only cared about because I know them from the original series, there were far too many convenient &quot;coincidences&quot; in the story and not enough background for any of the major factions (New Order? The Resistance? What happened to the Republic?). I also felt like overall the tone of the film was too comedic (lacked any real sense of drama, seriousness, or anticipation) and that the pacing was much, much too frenetic.\n\nNow I find myself wondering if I had never seen the original series-- i.e. if I were a blank slate -- would this film even make sense? I&apos;m not really sure. It certainly doesn&apos;t stand up well on its own, and neither does it fit particularly well within the scope of the Star Wars universe.\n\nI tried my best to like this movie. I really, really wanted to; but in the end I think there was too much lazy writing on display and too many poor script choices.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve got to admit, I only really watched this movie because of the (many, many) references in Brooklyn 99. And I got thinking, is Die Hard really that good? So, I gave it a watch, guided by the many, many Jake Peralta jokes that I had grown accustomed to. And I&apos;ve got to say, this is the action movie that paved the way for all future action movies.\n\nI usually have an aversion to Christmas movies as they all tend to turn into cheesy rom-coms but this was pretty awesome. And I think the reason for that is because that even though it was Christmassy where it mattered, the plot didn&apos;t completely revolve around it.\n\nI&apos;ve got to admit, most of it was guns and explosions and there was very little plot to go off of besides a pretty traditional three-act structure, but it was still pretty damn entertaining. And you know it&apos;s a good movie when about 90% of it was guns and blood and explosions and the other 10% was Bruce Willis saying badass things and crawling through vents in an ever-disintegrating tank top, and you stilled enjoyed it.\n\nThere was never a still moment in this movie, but unlike most times, where I just end up getting bored of the CGI-fest explosions, I was actually pretty captivated through the entire runtime. I&apos;m actually really pleasantly surprised. The ending is predictable, but it&apos;s nice. Not all movies have to be intellectual masterpieces. Sometimes you just need to switch your brain of a little and watch Bruce Willis kick ass.\n\nSo, Jake of B99 was right. I mean, it&apos;s badass, Bruce Willis has the best one-liners, you have cool explosions. There&apos;s not too much more I could say about this movie. Yippie kayak, other buckets.\n\n-Sasha.",

I am surprised that this movie even did not received any Oscar nominations.This movie surely deserves to be in top 250 list.Movie is a treat for Al Pacino&apos;s fans.\n\nThis movie is recommended for all adults.

In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them. Excellent acting by Brody.",

The team quickly assemble and flee, unfortunately Mark Watney is caught in the storm, loses his communication device and presumed dead. Watney has survived and has a harsh realism that he&apos;s abandoned on Mars with precious little supplies, no company and little chance of survival. Being 50 million miles away and 4 years away in terms of rescue life seems bleak. Watney has to defy the odds in order to survive.\n\nRidley Scott is responsible for so many wonderful films, and for many The Martian will sit among them.\n\nThis is a beautifully made film, it looks incredible, I love the realisation of Mars&apos;s surface, truly brilliant, wasn&apos;t going to be otherwise with the budget they had. The music is interesting, the score itself is quite subtle, but the tunes from Abba, Gloria Estefan etc are so random.\n\nThe pacing of the film is very cleverly done, never does it feel rushed, and on very few occasions does it feel slow or padded. If i&apos;m honest at twenty minutes I was questioning how the film was possibly going to last over two hours.\n\nMatt Damon shows his class, he carries the film on his shoulders, he gives a stellar performance as Mark, cannot be faulted. Some of the others in the film were a little hit and miss, I enjoyed Chiwetel Ejiofor very much. Jeff Daniels was fairly good. Kristen Wiig seemed an odd choice, but she was good too.\n\nIt was better then I expected, I enjoyed it a lot 8/10",

None could have pulled it off as well as he did.  Even his eyes showed no emotion with still showing true evil. Michael Beign is just the opposite.  A man sent from the future to stop this machine.  He plays his part as perfect as Schwarzenegger plays his.  A perfect cast of characters for an all star movie! Plenty of action, story line, plot, character interaction, love story, and romance.  Everything is tied into this movie that possibly could be, making it a 3 star movie.

While the story isn&apos;t as good as the first Avengers, the acting is still just as good, the action is even better, and Ultron isn&apos;t a bad villain, he&apos;s just an under-developed one. Honestly, the action makes up for most of the flaws of this movie and it also set up a lot of MCU films, or at least foreshadowed a lot. Movies like Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, and Captain America: Civil War. Overall, this isn&apos;t a bad film, at all, but it is the weakest of The Avengers franchise.",

But I liked this movie a lot, and according to someone who wrote a review earlier, that makes me personally responsible for the violence in America.  I&apos;m sorry - I never intended to hurt anyone.\n\nAs for the movie - I usually get confused in fast-paced movies with so many characters, but when I watched Snatch I was able to keep all the characters straight pretty easily because each one had something unique and quirky about him.  I liked that, and I liked the accents, and I liked the silly plot-twist humor, and I liked the dogs.  The evil men were EVIL (&quot;so evil you would call it the froo-its of the dev-eel&quot; to quote Mike Meyers).  The bumbling men were endearing.  The music was great.  \n\nIt was very violent (more so than Pulp Fiction, I think).  Yet somehow it did not offend me and looking back at it I still laugh out loud.\n\nOh, and I never saw &quot;Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;, for whatever that&apos;s worth."

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.\n\nMurphy&apos;s portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

The first being my personal favourite of the two with the most character development, main plot of the story and best dialogue. The second half being straight and fun action. The character that is Steve Rogers is by far the highlight of the movie, he is so courageous despite all his many flaws and continues to overcome his seemingly limitless barriers. It is wonderful to watch how he uses his new strength to fight his enemies and help his allies. Speaking of his enemies, red skull isn&apos;t portrayed extremely well, his is shown as a crazed man with a god complex, no other development or back story is given to the character, you could argue that it isn&apos;t really needed though. The introduction to Bucky Barnes&apos;s character is quite small but obviously leads to more later in his character arc. Besides this I don&apos;t have much else to say besides the action towards the end is quite good, a little drawn out a little silly and over the top but intense and enjoyable to watch. Also the soundtrack is incredible, it fits extremely nicely and is very uplifting. Also Also the comedy in the movie, which there is few, is far better than I remember and isn&apos;t just thrown in at the most random places. Overall a good origin story 7/10!",

This was a pretty bold move, a calculated stroll to the edge of the cliff and a daring leap off into the thin air of creativity and innovation. And it was a hit, ensuring 3d animation a place right alongside (more or less) 2d animation. And naturally, Pixar would be at the forefront, leading the cavalry charge of digital animation ranging from great to gawd-awful.\n\n&quot;Toy Story 3&quot; starts off as comfortably as possible, with our friends Woody and Buzz Lightyear doing what they do the best...playing with Andy in his world of make-believe adventure. We are then treated to some familiar Pixar progression, like abandonment, solidarity, coming back to friends, and the passing of the torch. Clearly, in the eleven years between this point and when &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; wrapped, a computer revolution or four has occurred, allowing a world of unsurpassed clarity, reality and imagination to shine through like never before. TS1&apos;s spark is TS2&apos;s candle, and that in turn is TS3&apos;s blazing sun.\n\nRoll the last fifteen minutes of film. It became clearly obvious that the figurative tables have been turned, because a good number of the adults in the audience (including myself) were sniffling and teary-eyed, while the kids were looking up, likely thinking &quot;jeez mom and dad, they&apos;re just toys, get over it&quot;.\n\nWasn&apos;t it conventional wisdom that just the kids get emotional over losing plastic playthings? With &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, Pixar has shown us one of the greatest magic tricks in modern showbiz history, likely not to be outdone or duplicated, that we all have very real and deep connections to our childhoods and to the things and people that allowed us as kids to be free, and innocent, and pure, and most importantly, to dream. This, to me, is a life lesson worth remembering, to infinity and beyond.\n\n&quot;Toy Story 3&quot; gets 10 of 10 blazing stars",

The humor is very tasteful, but can be oddly quirky in places. Lots of fun action. The only thing that could have used some improving was the way they filmed the movie. The shakey camera and weird angles are a little annoying, but the rest of the film makes up for this. Very good choice in the cast, could not have picked a better actor for Thor or Loki. Natalie Portman&apos;s part isn&apos;t the best. She has cheesy lines and her acting doesnt flow right, even though she is a talented actress. She does better with serious parts inatead of light and comical. This movie is very clean and makes a great fun movie for the entire family.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Things are different now, I have to protect the one thing that I can&apos;t live without. That&apos;s you.&quot;\n\nSince Shane Black has signed to do Iron Man 3 I have been so excited for this picture, and i was already excited enough for Marvel phase 2 after the Avengers. Teaming up once again in his second outing with his Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang lead, and it does not disappoint. \n\nA typical Super hero story, The international terrorist The Mandarin arrives on the scene and causes mayhem across the world, and may have help from some scientist acquaintances from Tony&apos;s past. For me Iron man&apos;s greatest strength is the casting of Robert Downey Jr. He encapsulates the character so well, the charisma,the humor, the ego so well. If this is to be his last appearance in a stand alone Iron Man. I for one can not think of anyone around at the moment who could take over the role,especially in the inevitable reboot of the franchise. Getting back to this film the cast of iron man has always been top notch with great support characters played by Don Cheadle, Gwyneth Paltrow, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley, and i could go on. This sequel hasn&apos;t gone down the usual route of recent sequels. Not going darker but keeping fun, not going bigger and louder (don&apos;t get me wrong there are some big action set pieces) but stripping Tony of the suit for large parts and focusing on the character. There is decent action to be seen, with the destruction of Tony Stark&apos;s home, for me being some of the best 5 minutes of intense action i have seen for quite some time. Also Iron man keeps it&apos;s good humor and puts in a decent amount of laughs. \n\nThe ending of the movie is where i find some problems, as it quite predictable and never built any sense of dread, that the bad guys could win. The bad guys in this film The Mandarin, Aldrich Killian and there Extremis Super soldiers. Which are a major improvement on previous Iron man villains. Seem very intimidating and imposing, but the motivation for there crimes seems a little fuzzy.\n\nA good film by Shane Black in his first foray in to comic book/action, and if it is Downey Jr&apos;s last. It&apos;s not a bad way to bow out.",

      "reviewBody": "That it was directed by Wes Anderson (who has a unique style that really fascinates, but admittedly not everybody will like or warm to his style) and that the cast is so stellar were reasons enough to see &apos;The Grand Budapest Hotel&apos; in the first place, as well as its many accolades and critical acclaim.\n\nWhile it isn&apos;t quite flawless, and it is easy to see why a number of people don&apos;t like or will not like it (due to a lot of the cast&apos;s roles being pretty short, only Gustave and Zero being fully fleshed out of the characters and those who have a problem with Anderson&apos;s style), &apos;The Grand Budapest Hotel&apos; is a visually stunning, hugely entertaining, wonderfully weird and impeccably cast and acted film.\n\nIt really stuns visually, with cinematography that is not only clever in technique but also gorgeous in aesthetic and tight, fluid editing. The costumes, production design and hair and make-up richly deserved their Oscar/Academy Award wins, the costume and production design have a lusciously colourful fairy-tale feel while also given substance by the bleakly atmospheric quality that reflects the crime drama aspect of the story brilliantly.\n\nAlexandre Desplat also received an Oscar, and with its hauntingly hypnotic and entrancing tones it richly deserved it as to me it was by far the best score of those nominated. Anderson directs superbly, the story balances darkness and quirkiness to great effect (the prison scene is unforgettable) and it&apos;s never too simplistic or convoluted (though of course the visuals, dialogue and performances make much more of an impact) and the screenplay is a sublime mixture of the dark, the quirky, the witty and the subtle delivered with rapid-fire.\n\n&apos;The Grand Budapest Hotel&apos; boasts an impeccable cast and pretty much everybody does a splendid job, though many of the roles are short. My only criticism of the film is that Harvey Keitel and Saoirse Ronan are underused and just get lost amongst everything else, an unrecognisable Tilda Swinton also has little to do but still gives a bat-out-of-hell performance.\n\nBill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson give very entertaining performances, while Edward Norton is delightfully droll and Adrien Brody and especially Willem Dafoe bring sinister foreboding to the film. Some may say that Tony Revolori is overshadowed by the more experienced cast members (being the only newcomer in a large cast of big names), but to me he more than holds his own and effectively plays it straight. The film belongs to Ralph Fiennes, in what is essentially the heart of the film, while he has always been a fine actor he has not given a performance this brilliant in years, never knew he could be so riotously funny.\n\nIn conclusion, a wonderful film and a hotel well worth revisiting more than once if to one&apos;s taste. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Spider-Man,&quot; which I saw in a screening. I thought the movie was very engrossing.  Director Sam Raimi kept the action quotient high, but also emphasized the human element of the story.  Tobey Maguire was very believable as the gawky teenager in the early part of the film and then, after his run-in with the radioactive, genetically engineered spider, as the athletic, acrobatic superhero of the title. His boyish glee at discovering his new superpowers was infectious and got a lot of laughs.  I also didn&apos;t mind the changes to the &quot;Peter Parker: The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; comic book story that the film&apos;s writers made, e.g., having Spider-Man&apos;s web come out of glands in his wrists rather than being an invention of Peter Parker&apos;s.  Especially good were Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben Parker, Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin, James Franco as Harry Osborn, and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson.  And in a small but memorable role, J.K. Simmons (&quot;Oz,&quot; Law &amp; Order&quot;) as newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious.  Perfect casting. I also thought the special effects were very good.  Although I could easily tell when Spidey was a computer-generated image (or a stunt double for that matter), it didn&apos;t detract from my enjoyment of the movie. However, I saw the movie with a six-year-old, who found the villainous Green Goblin -- superbly personified by Willem Dafoe -- very, very frightening, so I would advise against taking children younger than 10 years of age to this movie. &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; comic book was a childhood favorite of mine, and I can honestly say that Sam Raimi has done it justice!  I&apos;m going to go see this movie again (sans terrified six-year-old)."

      "reviewBody": "Good morning. Last night I was able to catch the Disney US Release of Spirited Away ( originally The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro). This is another  Disney purchase of a Japanese hit. For those that don&apos;t know, Disney has a nasty habit of importing titles from Japan and then changing the story when dubbing films or creatively editing the endings or plot to &quot;suit American audiences&quot;. Personally I think that&apos;s a travesty. So  whenever you go see the Disney release of a foreign film, realize the film you are watching may not be the &apos;same film&apos; the rest of the world sees.\n\nOK, that aside, was it a good film? I deliberately did no research before seeing this film as I prefer to go into films with little or no expectations. All I knew was that the film was directed and written by Hayao Miyazaki, the same man responsible for Princess Mononoke ( a film released a few years back that I also enjoyed). In the case of Spirited away, I&apos;m glad I did not know what I was getting myself into, otherwise I might not have come (and surprisingly, not for the reasons you likely assume).\n\nThe film concerns a young girl and her parents who find an odd tunnel in the side of a hill while moving to their new home. Upon investigating the tunnel, they find a strange &quot;theme park&quot; on the other side devoid of inhabitants. Upon investigating the theme park, things are obviously very &quot;wrong&quot; (at least to the little girl- her parents seem woefully oblivious) and as it gets closer to sunset, things just get worse. Unfortunately, this is all the plot I am able to reveal without spoiling the uniqueness of this film.\n\nThis is an &apos;adult-oriented&apos; movie. It has some rather disturbing images and ranks among the weirdest films I have seen in my life. It&apos;s a bizarre amalgam of Wizard of Oz,The Neverending Story, Alice in Wonderland, My Friend Totoro, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and The City of Lost Children (just to name a few). This film is interesting from beginning to end even though the plot advances rather slowly. There is always some new thing to see or some truly bizarre thing to witness. The animation is above average but not as impressive as Mononoke (and even features several gratuitous CGI sequences).\n\nThere is a great story and some great humor. I laughed more in this film than I have at any Hollywood &apos;comedy&apos; in the last 5 years (and Spirited Away is not a comedy, it just has several good comedic breaks). No nudity. No Profanity. No &apos;gratuitous&apos; violence. Some rather disturbing scenes of characters getting eaten alive (and some threats thereof) but even the eaten characters return unharmed later in the film.\n\nThis is not really a &apos;family film&apos; (and definitely NOT a &quot;kiddee film&quot;) but it is something you can take the whole family to. Smaller children will not understand the story, but they&apos;ll like the visuals and enjoy the humor. Mid-teens might be a bit &quot;weirded out&quot; by the subject matter and the visuals and older teens and adults may be too jaded by American cinema to enjoy the film for what it is- a lavish fairytale from a foreign country. This film runs about 2 hours so leave the &quot;kidney-buster&quot; sodas at the snack bar. If you have to take a bathroom break, you WILL miss something and I assure you no friend nor helpful audience member will likely be able to adequately convey what it is you DID just miss.\n\nIf you enjoy Anime or the bizarre, make an effort to see this film. Even if you don&apos;t normally like &quot;cartoon movies&quot;, you might give this one a chance. It is not a &apos;casual moviegoer&apos; film by any means and does rely on some thought from the audience to enjoy it. It will also likely be the oddest film you&apos;ll see this decade and you&apos;ll be sure to remember this film long after all the other &apos;disposable movies&apos; have faded from your recollection. This film is receiving almost no advertising. I didn&apos;t even know it existed until I saw the poster tucked away in a corner at the theatre earlier this week. I hope Disney puts a little more effort into advertising this film&apos;s release because it is truly an original film and worthy of a large audience. Hopefully positive word-of-mouth will get this film the attendance it deserves."

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Hippies, westerns, short skirts, pompadours, catchy pop songs ... all have (mostly) disappeared from our world. Back to save the day and the memories, and twist a little history, is Quentin Tarantino, the ultimate film geek. His latest reminds us of a bygone era of movie stars and old school filmmaking ... a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support. There have been plenty of big screen love letters to Hollywood, but few if any, were filmed with so many personal touches and call-backs to the director&apos;s own films.\n\nIn keeping with the request from Mr. Tarantino, this review will not include any spoilers or details that might negatively impact anyone&apos;s initial viewing of the film. It&apos;s a reasonable request since the film is so unique and literally packed with nostalgia, sight gags, and historical bits and pieces - some accurate, some not so much. There is a lot to take in and process, and the full impact of the initial viewing might result in awe, shock or disgust ... and maybe even all of the above. So this will be a pretty simple overview peppered with some insight that should enhance rather than spoil the experience.\n\nThe film covers about 6 months in 1969, but in reality, it all takes place (at least what we see on screen) in 3 days. Leonardo DiCaprio (possibly his best ever performance) plays Rick Dalton, an actor who had a hit (fictional) TV western series in the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s entitled &quot;Bounty Law&quot;. Since the show ended, Rick has been unable to make the successful transition to movies. For comparison, think of Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds - all actors in TV westerns who found greater career success in movies. Brad Pitt (the epitome of cool) stars as Cliff Booth, Rick&apos;s stunt double, friend, driver, handyman, etc. While Rick is desperate to find the next stage of his career and fend off being forgotten, Cliff, a Vietnam vet, is accepting of his lot in life. Rick lives in a swanky Hollywood Hills home next door to hotshot director Roman Polanski and his starlet wife Sharon Tate; and Cliff lives in a trailer behind the Van Nuys Drive-In with his well-trained Rottweiler Brandy.\n\nThere are multiple parallel stories to follow, and a key one involves the aforementioned Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie nails the role and bounces about town with the energy and sweet aura that we imagine she possessed. All 3 of the lead actors - DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie - have knockout scenes that I&apos;d love to be able to discuss, but I&apos;m not sure how without giving away too much. What I can say is that each of these three talented actors prove that movie stars still exist.\n\nThis is Tarantino&apos;s 9th film as a director (he counts the 2-part KILL BILL as one film), and he claims he will stop making films after number 10. There are multiple features we can count on in a QT film, and a ridiculously deep supporting cast is one. Going through each of the characters played by actors you will recognize would take a page and a half, so I&apos;ll cover only a few here. Margaret Qualley is a scene stealer as Pussycat, one of the Manson family girls. You likely remember her from the recent &quot;Fosse/Verdon&quot; or &quot;The Leftovers&quot;, and here she fully embraces the hippie look and spirit. Emile Hirsch plays hairdresser Jay Sebring, one of those in the house with Ms. Tate on that fateful night, and Mike Moh plays Bruce Lee so convincingly that I was momentarily confused when he took off his sunglasses. Also making appearances are some Tarantino regulars: Kurt Russell (as a stunt coordinator and narrator), Michael Madsen (as an actor), and Bruce Dern as George Spahn (a late replacement after Burt Reynolds passed away). Others of note include Maya Hawke (Uma Thurman&apos;s daughter), Austin Butler (recently cast in the title role of Baz Luhrmann&apos;s Elvis biopic) as Tex Watson, Rumer Willis (Bruce&apos;s daughter) as actress Joanna Pettet, Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen, Al Pacino as agent Marvin Schwarzs, Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme, and the late Luke Perry as actor Wayne Maunder (&quot;Lancer&quot;). 90 year old Clu Gulager (&quot;The Virginian&quot;, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW) makes an appearance, and Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich from THE SOUND OF MUSIC) tears into his role with gusto as director Sam Wanamaker. There is even a TV Guide cover featuring the late great character actor Andrew Duggan (&quot;Lancer&quot;). Some of these, and many more, are like cameos, but it&apos;s still fascinating to see the faces.\n\n1969 was 50 years ago, and Tarantino does a remarkable job of recreating the look of Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, Cielo Drive, and studio backlots. Much credit goes to Production Designer Barbara Ling and Set Decorator Nancy Haigh (frequent Coen Brothers collaborator and an Oscar winner for BUGSY). Arianne Phillips does a tremendous job with the costumes that look natural for the time period, and not like something right off the wardrobe racks. Three-time Oscar winning Cinematographer Robert Richardson (HUGO, THE AVIATOR, JFK) is back for his 6th Tarantino film, and he captures the look and feel and vibe of a time that is so personal to the director.\n\nIt&apos;s been three and a half years since THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Tarantino&apos;s most recent film, and probably his worst received. This one is clearly personal as it captures the time and place that he fell in love with movies. The dichotomy of rising starlet and fading cowboy as neighbors is a brilliant way to make a point about times changing. This was a time of transition in the United States - a new culture was upon us, and whatever innocence remained, was surely snuffed out on a hot August night in 1969. As usual, his use of music serves a purpose. We are treated to Roy Head, The Royal Guardsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, among others. QT also shows us plenty of bare feet (another trademark). What is unusual is that the film lacks the trademark mass dialogue. This one kind of meanders ... right up until it doesn&apos;t.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is a living, breathing film geek (that&apos;s a compliment) who has earned the right to make the movies he wants to make. This one took him a lifetime to live, 5 years to write, and it will take you 161 minutes to watch. It was warmly received at Cannes, but no one can expect to &quot;catch&quot; everything Mr. Tarantino has served up in one viewing. That said, one viewing will likely be one too many for quite a few folks (especially many under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood). Some will categorize this as an overindulgent nostalgia trip for movie nerds. And they are likely correct. But for those of us who complain that too many movies are remakes, re-treads and comic books, there is no denying Tarantino delivers a unique and creative viewing experience - and it&apos;s not meant for everyone.",

This is not only due to the incredible locations, but also to the excellent (and by excellent I mean excellent) camera-work. Frequently I was just blown away by the sheer beauty of the rough terrain of Canada and how it was captured by the crew. However, there are a few drawbacks. Mainly the story (it is a very simple revenge story line) and the dialog (it is basically not existent :D).\n\nWhen I first left the movie I was still blown away by all the great things I mentioned above (I was thinking about a 10/10 rating), but the longer I was outside the movie the more I recognized that &quot;The Revenant&quot; is a film that is incredible entertaining whilst sitting in the cinema, but also a movie I quickly forgot about when being at home again.\n\nStill, the movie is definitely a must-see.

How-ever after watching the movie it did make me a Harry Potter movie fan. And needless to say - this continues to remain my favourite of HP series. That brings to a point here.... the effect of expectations over a movie. True, expectations reduce joy.\n\nWithout going into the story I would certainly say Chris Columbus churns out a perfect pot-pourri of emotions, suspense and magic, delivering something appealing to all ages.\n\nEvery character brought to life on screen has done justice and leave an impression on you. Particularly notable performances by Emma Watson and Alan Rickman.\n\nCGI are in plenty and made good of. The Quedditch game is picturised amazingly. The wizard&apos;s chess is treat to eyes.\n\nLet&apos;s hope that the forthcoming HP series carries the similar magical touch."

      "reviewBody": "!! Possible Spoilers!!\n\n*Iron Man 2* picks up shortly after the events of its predecessor, finding Tony Stark basking in the glow of his newfound hero status. However, the film quickly reveals a darker underbelly to the billionaire playboy&apos;s life. His reliance on the Arc Reactor, the power source for his Iron Suit, is slowly poisoning him, while the demands of the public and the military put immense pressure on Stark Industries.\n\nMickey Rourke delivers a menacing performance as Ivan Vanko, a bitter Russian scientist seeking revenge against Stark for his father&apos;s downfall. Vanko&apos;s creation, the Whiplash suit, proves to be a formidable opponent for Iron Man. The film also introduces Samuel L. Jackson&apos;s Nick Fury in a more prominent role, laying the groundwork for the Avengers initiative.\n\nWhile Downey Jr. Continues to shine as the charismatic and witty Tony Stark, the film struggles to maintain the same level of originality and excitement as its predecessor. The plot becomes increasingly convoluted as it juggles multiple storylines, including Stark&apos;s personal struggles, the threat of Vanko, and the introduction of new characters like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle).\n\nThe action sequences are undeniably impressive, with the iconic climax featuring multiple Iron Suits battling it out. However, the film&apos;s pacing suffers at times, and the overall tone is less focused than the first installment. Additionally, the resolution of the palladium poisoning plot point feels somewhat rushed and anticlimactic.\n\nKey plot points:-\n\n* Tony Stark&apos;s dependency on the Arc Reactor * The introduction of Ivan Vanko and the Whiplash * The development of the War Machine armor * Black Widow&apos;s first appearance in the MCU * The increasing involvement of Nick Fury and S. H. I. E. L. D.\n\nDespite its flaws, *Iron Man 2* is still an entertaining superhero film with plenty of eye-catching moments. It successfully expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe and sets the stage for future installments. However, it ultimately falls short of reaching the heights of its predecessor.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is fantastic! Pixar has yet another great film to add to their impressive repertoire. Oscar-winning director and screenwriter Brad Bird, who wrote and directed &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, has produced a film with subtle humor, heart, and very profound truth. The voice actors are so great, and it is especially great to hear Peter O&apos;Toole on the screen. The animation is beautiful and it is all around an excellently made film. Its message is one that holds so much truth for everyone, especially today&apos;s youth: it tells people that no, not anyone can do anything, but if you have the talent you don&apos;t have to be limited by your surroundings or your upbringing. I think this is refreshing to hear because often, children are lied to when they are told they can do anything, when actually not all of them can. But it offers hope to the ones who may feel limited by their social class. It also exposes the fact that most people try to put up false facades of themselves to hide who they are in order to feel accepted by the social standards we create in our society; it shows characters with this flaw, but ultimately they accept this reality and learn to be true to themselves. This thread, I think, is very common throughout the Pixar films, and they present it very well. &quot;Ratatouille&quot; is my new Disney-Pixar favorite! &quot;Ce film a pleine de joie de vivre!&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Lucas may have problems as a director and writer, but I&apos;ve always thought that those flaws are balanced by his great storytelling ability. The problem with &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; is that he simply has no story to tell. The film merely adds an introductory chapter to a story that has already been told, and stretches it out into a two-hour movie. It is no accident that prequels of this kind are rare. They are very difficult to make properly. And apparently he&apos;s just not a sophisticated enough filmmaker to pull it off.\n\nFor one thing, this project is limited by the fact that anyone familiar with the first trilogy knows the story&apos;s outcome, and it therefore lacks some of the suspense associated with a gradually unfolding saga. More importantly, however, this situation leaves Lucas with very little freedom as a storyteller. It also encourages him to gloss over key events; because their outcome is a foregone conclusion, he forgets to bring them to life.\n\nFor example, we know there will eventually be a romance between Anakin and Padme. So Lucas has the two characters meet here and--surprise, surprise--they seem to like each other. Their developing friendship isn&apos;t portrayed that clearly, and their motivations for becoming close aren&apos;t explained. Because Lucas fails to make scenes like these believable, we can&apos;t help being conscious of how he&apos;s manipulating the plot in his effort to connect the two trilogies. Another good example of this problem is Anakin&apos;s portrayal as a potential Jedi. There doesn&apos;t appear to be anything about this kid remotely out of the ordinary, even though the other characters keep talking like there is. Our only reason for thinking he&apos;s special is that the plot requires it.\n\nIf the story fails to be engaging, it is because we never see the important events. Lucas makes a fatal error in not showing what&apos;s happening on Naboo, the small planet whose capture is the focus of the plot. Numerous atrocities are supposedly being committed against the planet&apos;s inhabitants, but we only know about this because the characters on screen refer to the events, usually rather woodenly.\n\nThe deadpan performances are a problem in themselves, but they only highlight our lack of involvement in the story. Think of Han Solo sweating in fear, then think of the emotional vacuums passing for characters in this film. Whenever any of the characters do express emotion, as in the scene where Anakin and his mom part, it still seems awfully restrained. Somehow, Lucas manages to keep the emotional reactions of his characters to a minimum, which gives the film an almost mechanical feel.\n\nIt&apos;s true that &quot;A New Hope&quot; never showed Alderaan&apos;s inhabitants, but we still could feel the tragedy of the planet&apos;s destruction through the horrified reactions of Princess Leia and Obi Wan. Moreover, there were many other involving events which we witnessed directly, such as the slaying of rebels at the beginning; the capture and torture of the princess; and the murder of Luke&apos;s foster parents. Furthermore, the major plot elements were intriguing in and of themselves. They weren&apos;t there merely to show us how they were to be linked to later events, which seems to be the case with the new film.\n\nI suspect that Lucas was not as concerned in the first trilogy with what had to happen later in the story and was therefore able to focus his attention on the events at hand. The weakest segment was &quot;Return of the Jedi,&quot; which had the task of bringing the story to an end. Only then did Lucas start to show signs of forcing plot points. In &quot;The Phantom Menace,&quot; he gets so bogged down in the task of bringing his story from point A to point B that he ends up with only the bare bones of a plot, and none of it comes alive.\n\nThis is especially true of the characterization. In the old trilogy, characters like Yoda and Han reveal distinct personalities in their first few minutes on screen. This film goes for more than two hours and the characters, including the familiar ones, come off vague and nondescript. We aren&apos;t given much of a chance to experience their personalities in the way they interact. We must take Qui Gon&apos;s word for it when he describes Obi Wan as &quot;headstrong.&quot; What&apos;s most odd is that the cartoons seem better developed than the humans. The scenes where Qui Gon negotiates with the birdlike slave-owner Watto are amusing and well-done--probably the movie&apos;s best scenes aside from the stunning action sequences--but they can&apos;t hold a candle to the constant interactions throughout the first trilogy.\n\nOne thing I cannot do is accuse the film of lacking creativity. The design of the creatures, the technologies, and the planets is impressive. Watching the film is sort of like reading a children&apos;s book that isn&apos;t very good but abounds with beautiful illustrations. There is certainly a &quot;wow&quot; factor in the movie&apos;s visuals, but the effect of it is short-lived.\n\nI get irked when I hear fans talk as though the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies were never about anything beyond special effects. While the inventive visuals are part of what made the originals so revolutionary, they&apos;re not what made the films so fun to watch. And in no way can they explain the trilogy&apos;s continuing popularity today. After all, many of the original effects look primitive by today&apos;s standards, and their novelty has certainly worn off. Only an enduring and compelling storyline could have allowed the first three films to become the classics they&apos;re almost universally acknowledged to be.",

It felt gritty, it felt real with a sense of dread and hopelessness you don&apos;t often see in this comic-book blockbuster adaptations. It should be praised for doing things differently and really pushing the edge with what can or can&apos;t be done in the genre. The triangle between Logan, Charles and Laura works as the driving force of the plot, and is very well developed. Logan&apos;s character arch is quite pleasant to watch, though obviously predictable. With that said, the acting is clearly masterclass. You can feel the dilemmas, the emotions and feelings that the characters are put through, specially those three. And another thing it does really well is alluding to a previous event - the Charles incident - but never fully explaining it to the audience, leaving you wondering. The action is nothing like you&apos;d expect from a tenthpole - the R rating really makes up for wonders - being quite visceral and impactful. &quot;Logan&quot; probably deserved a better villain, although one could argue that the real villain here is not the typical multinational corporation, but the inner demons of the characters. Demons that prevent them from living albeit normal and somewhat stable life.",

      "reviewBody": "Captain America: Winter Soldier was everything I wanted from a superhero movie. It was well directed, written and acted, and I was very excited for the next Captain America movie. And this movie most definietly delivered in quality. Is it as good as its predecessor? No, definietly not. There are a few flaws, which I&apos;ll talk about later. With that being said, this movie gets 4 things right for every one thing it does wrong. The plot is engaging and for the most part easy to follow and the pacing is solid. The characters all feel very 3-dimentional and fleshed out, and none of them feel different from what we already know. The movie&apos;s biggest strength is the interactions between the characters, and the different arguments presented by both sides. I love that despite obviously wanting us to side with Cap&apos;s team, the movie doesn&apos;t really make one side the &quot;correct&quot; one. Both sides present reasonable and logical arguments, and there is no right answer to what the Avengers should do. The new characters such as Black Panther and Spiderman are both very interesting and compelling, and both feel like a natural inclusion to the character list. All this is of course helped by some excellent performances as usual. The direction and cinematography are also both really good, and the action scenes are almost just as good as in Winter Soldier, even though some feel a little meaningless. And, while it might not be a big deal, MAN was it good to see a truly great antagonist in Zemo. He&apos;s well written and very well played by Daniel Brühl, and he challenges the ideological perspectives of our hero in a way no other villain in the MCU has done before. With that being said, his plan is somewhat ridiculous, and felt a little too complicated. The movie also feels a little dumb sometimes. It feels like Cap and Stark could&apos;ve solved the issue much sooner had they just communicated better. Those are my main complaints, and while there are a few other things I could nitpick, nothing really ruins the film by any means. It&apos;s a more mature take on the Marvel formula, and while it&apos;s the best movie in the franchise, it&apos;s still more than good enough for me to recommend it.",

They must then try to retrace their steps and locate the missing buddy. I&apos;m always a bit hesitant to fall into the mass market when it comes to something popular because a lot of times I end up watching the film and it turns out to be a major disappointment but that&apos;s not the case with this gem because it lived up to its reputation and in my opinion passed them. I&apos;m not going to call this the greatest film of the year but I might add it&apos;s the most original. You&apos;d think a comedy about getting messed up in Vegas would be &quot;been there, done that&quot; but this takes a familiar set up and does something original with it. Instead of showing us the crazy party night, we don&apos;t see a second of it and instead we&apos;re thrown into a mystery and the laughs come from trying to figure out that mystery. For my money the screenplay is nearly flawless as it does a great job at building up our thoughts on what happened but the film then takes us to places that you certainly won&apos;t see coming. The majority of the laughs come from things that you normally wouldn&apos;t expect like a masterful scene involving a trunk. Even the jokes that you do expect (strippers) is done extremely well and with hilarious results. I won&apos;t ruin many of the jokes because of the &quot;mystery&quot; behind them is what makes them work so well but there were several scenes where tears were running down my face from laughing so hard. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis give terrific performances and their chemistry and comic timing with one another helps push the film even further. The three make for an excellent team and watching this film makes it look like the trio had been working together for years because they come off so well together. Heather Graham isn&apos;t too bad in her role and the great Jeffrey Tambor even gets a nice laugh. You really have to respect a movie that takes a familiar plot and mixes it up to the point of it being completely original and most importantly, downright hilarious. I hate labeling films when they&apos;re so fresh but I would be shocked if this movie isn&apos;t looked at in ten years the same way we look at &quot;dirty&quot; comedies like NATIONAL LAMPOON&apos;S ANIMAL HOUSE and PORKY&apos;S today."

      "reviewBody": "When I asked the reviewer sitting next to me to sum up Revenge of the Sith, he simply said &quot;great!&quot; That seemed to basically be the consensus of virtually everyone in attendance at an advance press screening of the final chapter in the Star Wars saga.\n\nThere was an exuberant mood leaving the theater, as if everyone was in collective agreement that Lucas had finally done it. That he had gone out on top, with a stunning, rock-solid coup de grace. And from all the feedback I&apos;ve heard from that screening, my sense of that collective mood was right.\n\nThere are no real spoilers in ROTS. Everyone basically knows what happens in Episode 4: A New Hope. We all know Anakin becomes Vader. We know Obi Wan lives and we know Luke and Leia are born. What we don&apos;t know is how Lucas weaves those story lines into the large, six-part opus and better yet, why?\n\nNo, it&apos;s not a perfect movie. There are those moments that make us cringe. Bad dialog and High School drama class acting make for a few awkward moments where you can hear audible moans and giggles in the audience, but we have come to expect this from modern Star Wars films. The upside is that these moments are rare in Episode III. \n\nOK, get ready. Take a deep breath. No Jar Jar! Yes, you read that right. You can let out that deep breath now.\n\nFortunately, we have one savior to rely on for stellar acting. Mr. Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. McDiarmid brings the elegance of an Alec Guiness back to the franchise in a knockout performance that leaves the audience riveted and exhausted. He is the lifeblood of the film.\n\nAs someone who saw the original 30 times in it&apos;s first month of release at the age of 13, I currently consider myself a Star Wars moderate. I don&apos;t have volumes of SW merchandise, nor can I debate whether or not carbonite contains enough oxygen to make it float. All I know is that magical feeling Star Wars gave me in the original 1977 release and that I&apos;m happy to say, after a disappointing pair of prequels, has been finally restored and reinvigorated.\n\nHere&apos;s to Mr. Lucas for giving us all something spectacular to remember for our entire lives that embodies the whole point of going to the movies in the first place, to escape and lose ourselves in another world.",

      "reviewBody": "There has already been some talk coming from Telluride that this film is set to be this year&apos;s &apos;Juno.&apos; It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.\n\nDuring the premiere of the final cut (in the words of director Danny Boyle) at the Toronto International Film Festival, the audience gave the film an incredibly enthusiastic response, and it went on to win the People&apos;s Choice Award. Boyle, who is somewhat like a British Richard Linklater for yet again surprising the audience with such diverse subject matter, worked his magic. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture.\n\nJust about every aspect of this film deserves merit, and above all it belongs to Boyle, who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A. R. Rahman, with contributions from M. I. A., perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still, it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop, Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive, especially coming from the younger cast, almost all of which has never acted before.\n\nThe film begins as Jamal (Skins&apos; Dev Patel) is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India&apos;s version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says, even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize, and so Jamal, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai, cannot possibly know these things. As Jamal tries to avoid further torture, he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers. Flashbacks present Jamal&apos;s boyhood and explain how he got to the show.\n\nAt the centre of his journey is his brother, Salim, and a girl, Latika, who is left a homeless orphan after an attack that took Jamal&apos;s mother as well. After running from a man who exploits the trio for labour, Jamal replays the incident when Latika left his life when she was unable to catch a moving train. His uncertainty of her fate on the streets of Mumbai and his intense desire to see his first and only love again lead him to the interrogation room where the film began.\n\nLike &apos;Juno,&apos; Slumdog Millionaire is by genre a comedic drama, but it becomes much more. The film asks questions about fate, righteousness, greed, and even urban sprawl. Above all, however, it asks about love in the face of the most dire obstacles, and if it can truly prosper. Jamal&apos;s story is a tragic and unfortunate one, but as seen through his eyes, it is still beautiful. The vast colour palate of India overwhelm any negative feelings, and Jamal&apos;s hope of finding and being with Latika overwhelm despair. For Jamal, 20m rupees isn&apos;t his prize. It would be nearly impossible for there to be a better picture this year.",

Enjoy it for what it is which is a good tale, great action scenes, (if not a little over done), great war film acting and above all, a moral tale for today&apos;s age.\n\nAs for the historical angle and the comparison against the old film, try to enjoy this one as a modern updated version not unknown for its up to date (and cgi&apos;d) feel. \n\nIts the sort of film which made me want to find out about the Spartans and this particular period. Sad of me? Maybe, but I don&apos;t mind, it was great fun.\n\nEnjoy, I certainly did.",

The film left me on the edge of my seat all the time, one could argue things were slow sometimes but it only adds to the beauty of the big picture.\n\nPerformance are top notch and if it was for me I would give Jackman his very deserved Oscar for this amazing performance, of course all the other performances were really great also but Hugh&apos;s stands out for me.\n\nThis movie is worth your time, and I&apos;m sure by the end of it you&apos;ll keep talking about it with your friends, for me that is a success stamp if the movie can keep my mind busy all the time.\n\nThis is not your feel-good movie. This is a perfectly paced thriller which I haven&apos;t seen anything like it in a very long time. For me this was a totally new experience as I usually go for lighter movies in the cinema, but after this movie I will go out of my comfort-zone in movies more often to find masterpieces like this one.",

The Batman is told almost as a crime noir, made in a way that you could watch it in black and white to enjoy a different perspective.\n\nInteresting in that it&apos;s a real exploration of the character, his past and family, we get a sense as to why this Batman is so haunted.\n\nI wasn&apos;t blown away when I heard that Robert Pattinson was cast as Batman, Vengeance, but I was won over very quickly by him, clearly penned as a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, this incarnation is dark, haunted, relentless, but strong and determined. Don&apos;t expect laughs or lighter moments, there aren&apos;t any.\n\nAndy Serkis awesome as always, I thought Colin Farrell and Paul Dano were great too.\n\nGreat visuals throughout, Gotham looks terrific, and there are some terrific special effects, and a few duff ones too. I think Pattinson looked awesome in the costume, it was well designed.\n\nThe music was fantastic I thought, one of the movie&apos;s best elements, interesting seeing so much carnage played out to Ave Maria, a real juxtaposition.\n\nI wish I could say it was without any flaws, as it is an epic, imaginative reimagining, one that deserved its success, however pacing is an issue, it feels long for the sake of being long at times, some scenes are painfully drawn out. Some of the dialogue was hard to make our at times too, was it me, or was some of it a little muffled?\n\nWhat I really didn&apos;t like though, the ending, that has to knock a couple of stars of the rating, it just didn&apos;t work.\n\nInteresting to see what comes next, this was an imaginative retelling.\n\n7/10.",

      "name": "A complex story about adolescence, alternate realities, and the possibility that we are not masters of our own destiny",
      "reviewBody": "At first, Donnie Darko is a difficult film to understand and can seem absurd. What helps a lot to understand it and has made it a very beloved film is taking into account the concepts of parallel realities. It mentions time travel and although that is not exactly witnessed, the complexity of the film is based more on the fourth dimension. Donnie is the protagonist of a science fiction story in a parallel world, which is forced to play a role to prevent the destruction of existence itself. The mysterious Frank and many around Donnie become pawns for him to achieve his goal. The film mixes a whole series of elements, allegories, metaphors and messages that make it a quite enigmatic film. Using a book given to Donnie, he gives clues that the world Donnie stars in is not what the viewer initially thinks. The film uses Donnie and the events of the story quite a bit to raise the point that everything that happens in the world is connected and therefore the events of the world are part of a grand scheme. That would imply that all the actions and decisions that human beings take are already planned and that destiny is what really controls our lives. What would be raised would be something compared to the Loki series that raises the idea that there is no free will and that we must all fulfill a destiny that has been implanted in us to maintain a universal order. Even according to the philosophy of The Matrix, the decision is an illusion and the paradox arises as to whether we can really control our destiny or are we only tools of a great scheme forged by destiny. Donnie questions what he has to do a lot and that makes you think about what consequences there could be in the universe if someone goes off their path, breaking the scheme that maintains universal order. The Butterfly Effect theory and even other time travel films raise the question of what things would be like if such important events had not occurred. The film also gives Donnie a savior role, turning him into an allegory for Jesus Christ and other martyrs whose sacrifices were essential to a cause. The mention of the movie &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; is also a key because of the plot it had. Like that film, Donnie Darko is a story about sacrifice and death as a necessary destiny for future events and for the universal scheme. In that aspect, the film has a biblical metaphor behind it. Another element that makes up this film is its allegory about adolescence and it is something that is reflected in Donnie when upon entering that stage, he asks himself many questions, reflects a lot, knows love and suffers this internal struggle about whether to fulfill his destination. Frank even becomes his guide of sorts and symbolizes the aggressive rebellion that many young people go through. It can be said that the film knows how to use Donnie to represent the psychology of young people and think about the kind of role that destiny has in store for them. It is not strange that it has some moments of cringe humor that are characteristic of teenagers. It can be concluded that Donnie Dark is another independent film with an unconventional plot that gives it a lot of resistance, although it leaves a couple of doubts to decipher. It is not a film that can be understood by those who do not take into account the aforementioned elements, but all the elements that characterize it are what make it an authentic cult film. It is not a film recommended for everyone, only for educated people and movie buffs. My final rating for this movie is an 8/10.",

While he lives in a country that constantly rejects him. (Even in these reviews lol) Really really take yourself out your shoes and put them in his. I know for SOME this may be very hard. \n\nTo say you didn&apos;t like this film because the plot lacked is nothing but pandering and hiding behind of a veil of ignorance. It&apos;s so ironic that this movie with so much grandeur and life is getting bashed by close minded Americans. It&apos;s truly telling.

      "reviewBody": "Visually stunning. A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick&apos;s 1968 masterpiece &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn&apos;t accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something. Kubrick used Keir Dullea in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, yes, Keir Dullea, or as Noel Coward put it, Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow. We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she, one way or another, will land safely. She&apos;s terrific, don&apos;t get me wrong, but I wasn&apos;t as worried about her as I should have been. The last problem was the score. Why? A standard horror/action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there. I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department. Now, putting all that aside, director Alfonso Cuaron must be applauded and I strongly recommend you to run and see it in the biggest screen you can find and in 3D.",

      "reviewBody": "For some reason, I couldn&apos;t quite catch this movie in theaters and I managed to watch it on an international flight. And boy, am I glad I did! \n\nAs far as concepts go, I was astonished at the amount of detail and coherence in execution. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the colors rich and vibrant, the characters utterly memorable and some of the most poignantly heart-breaking lines of dialogue ever spoken/sung in any movie, let alone feature animation. It is every bit a Disney-Pixar classic and as emphatic a return to form as it can get.\n\nThe story revolves around a young girl child who is happy in her world and has to suddenly acclimatize to another environment when her family has to move. Growing pains and social issues affect her while she grapples with increasingly complex situations, both at home and school. Meanwhile, the interplay between the five primary emotions inside her mind is both dynamic and fraught with compromises, much like how we deal with others everyday. As things come to a head and young Riley is about to make a life-changing decision, the events that follow leave a lasting impression, with an increased appreciation of the phrase &quot;emotions are what makes us human&quot;! \n\nI recognized some dichotomies - for instance, Minnesota, usually perceived cold, is regarded as warm and comforting by Riley while San Francisco, renowned for its sunny weather, is seen as foreign and unwelcome. The other contrast I noticed was all five emotional figures (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust) do not always stay true to form, with Joy especially exhibiting nuances far beyond what her name implies - case in point, her touching admission preceding the last act (that entire sequence was too much for my eyes to take, by the way). All this might be considered a tad too much for young children to appreciate, but with time, they may probably realize how beautifully honest this movie was in trying to portray their growth and the underlying issues.\n\nCertainly, it is not without flaws: the plot meandered a bit 2/3rds into the length; Joy&apos;s &quot;A-ha&quot; moment seems strangely contrived, despite the impact it had; the music was adequate but not truly captivating as in the case of other Pixar offerings. But the beauty of this medium is that it offers filmmakers opportunities to steer audiences to more engaging experiences; Pete Docter and Co accomplish this with aplomb.\n\nIn terms of cast and crew, the voice actors are superb selections - Lewis Black aces the Angry persona with generous dollops of sarcasm; Mindy Kaling is just perfect voicing Disgust; Richard Kind&apos;s performance as the imaginary Bing Bong is an absolute tear-jerker, while Kaitlyn Dias shows remarkable poise playing Riley. But it is Amy Poehler who steals the show in a coruscating blend of vivacity, vibrancy, and vicariousness. Her Joy is not an infallible leader, but one who accepts others in the face of challenging situations and plows ahead with inspiring positive energy. The animation left me spell-bound, especially the sequence where thoughts are shown to be abstracted, and are endowed with a lot of heart. The movie is fairly short, but a running time of 94 minutes is appropriate justice to a slightly heavy subject matter. The humor compensates with trademark Pixar staple of jokes, albeit intended for slightly more mature viewers. Pete Docter gave us the outstanding Up six years ago and ably accompanied by Ronnie del Carmen, has categorically demonstrated that he is a fabulous storyteller and a master entertainer.\n\nInside Out is every bit a Pixar fan&apos;s well-deserved reward for patience. Do yourself a favor and watch this magnificent gem.",

      "reviewBody": "I hope that this movie does really well because this has to be one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. The story is really cool and it&apos;s obvious that there is a lot of respect here for the source of superheroes, whether it be comic books, serial flicks or Saturday morning cartoons.\n\nThe movie has an undeniably cool retro feel to it and it shows not only in the design of the picture but also in the music, which definitely sounds like something out of a 60&apos;s 007 flick. It is also unusually dark, especially for a Pixar flick. I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s dark where people are getting their heads delivered to someone in a box or family members are sleeping with each other or anything like that but there were moments where I found myself wondering if a little kid might be able to deal with the intensity of what was going on on screen. Maybe it was the fact that the heroes were in very real danger most of the time. The bad guys weren&apos;t out to catch them as much as they were out to kill them. When you discover who the film&apos;s villain is, you can literally feel his anger coming off the screen. I may be over-exaggerating a bit but then again, it really is to the film&apos;s credit that it deals with human emotions in the way that it does.\n\nEven though you are watching a film that is populated by CGI characters, the emotions they convey in what they say and do come across as purely believable. Whether watching Bob Parr interact with people at his job or just sitting at his desk was something that rang true to me, just in the feeling of it. Everything about this movie has a very concrete feel to it, even while looking like something you&apos;d see in a comic book. The computer graphics in general were absolutely amazing and the voice acting is excellent across the board, so good in fact, that I really can&apos;t pick a favorite from the entire cast. I have to say that Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter were very good as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl respectively. They had a moment near the end of the film that actually touched me but you can see that for yourselves. Samuel L. Jackson was hilarious and thankfully, he wasn&apos;t overused. Dash and Violet were realized so well that every time they came up on screen, I loved every minute of it. Dash, in particular was one of the funniest characters in the movie. Jason Lee made for a formidable villain as Syndrome. I loved the fact that he was your typical antagonist but was also aware of the conventions surrounding such a role, like when he chides himself for &apos;monologuing&apos;. He was also one ruthless bastard, I&apos;ll give him that. Even the bit part characters were hilarious. There was a kid on a tricycle in this movie who comes out twice and made me laugh out loud both times. \n\nIn fact, this movie reminds me of why I like Finding Nemo over Monsters, Inc. In Finding Nemo, not only are the main characters great but every other character they run into makes some kind of impression on you. Remember all the characters that Marlin and Dory ran into on their adventures together? Of course you do. Whether it was that crazy pelican with the Australian accent, Willem Dafoe as Gill, leader of the fishtank crew, or Bruce the Shark, you remember them after all is said and done and it makes the viewing experience that much richer. That&apos;s exactly how The Incredibles is. Every character that appears will make you laugh or intrigue you in some way. I have to admit that I was laughing myself throughout the entire movie, especially with the character of Edna Mode who almost steals the movie. Man, even the end credits are awesome! I have to give the director Brad Bird a big thumbs up for this one. He pulled it off and hopefully this will attract attention to his other animated film, &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, which was sadly overlooked when it was released and is also a really great film.\n\nAll in all, I can&apos;t recommend this movie enough. I left very satisfied and felt no need to compare this to the rest of Pixar&apos;s movies. This one is just as good if not better than any other animated movie released this year and rightfully deserves its place among the best animated movies of all time.\n\nRATING: ***** out of *****.",

What got to me the most in this movie is the message I got out of it, I got it from a single line uttered by the hero and it just burned in my memory, it&apos;s about how when we look deep in the eyes of our enemies -the ones we fear the most- we will see that they are afraid of us just as we are afraid of them, we might realize their humanity and that they are not what we thought, monsters.\n\nThis is definitely one of the best 2 animation movies this year, with Toy Story 3 being the other one, tough job for the academy awards this year, and hope this is the case every year.\n\nIt&apos;s nice to see beautiful animation movies challenging Pixar&apos;s, it definitely benefits the viewer the most. How to train your dragon - Highly Recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "Blade Runner describes a future in which, through genetics, artificial humans are manufactured and called &quot;replicants&quot;; employees in dangerous jobs and slaves in the outer colonies of the Earth. Made by Tyrell Corporation under the motto &quot;more humans than humans&quot; -especially the &quot;Nexus-6&quot; models- not only resembles humans, they are far superior physically.\n\nThe replicants were declared illegal on planet Earth after a bloody mutiny occurred on the planet Mars, where they worked as slaves. A special police force, Blade Runners, is in charge of identifying, tracking and killing - or &quot;withdrawing&quot;, in terms of the police itself - the fugitive replicants found on Earth. With a group of replicants loose in Los Angeles, Rick Deckard, the best agent that has existed in regard to the recovery and removal of the replicas, is removed from his semi-retirement to use some of &quot;the old magic blade runner&quot;.\n\nRidley Scott fantastic dark cyberpunk style and futuristic design is so well made that accomplished to create a visual vocabulary: neon lights, abandonment, decay, loneliness, obscurity, indifference and alienation are the core of the aesthetics of the film, which will eventually become and serve as a pattern for successive cinematographic works.\n\nThe script David Webb Peoples adapted from &apos;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&apos; takes the viewer into a dwelling and philosophical controversy, as it creates doubt and empathy to the so called replicants, primarily as seen in many shots of Rick Deckard hesitating about the true nature of his task.\n\nHarrison Ford and Rutger Hauer haunts the attention into the essence of the story. Their characterization throughout infiltrates the different conceptions of life. A saddened soul searching for the meaning of his punished existence and the other, ruminating a task sinking him into a moral void brimming with guilt.\n\nAt the end, the movie leaves you wondering about the implications the creation of highly intelligent beings (IA) must have and, if it&apos;s worth treating them as machines or they have become so human that the difference is non existent.\n\n&quot;Time... to die&quot;.\n\n10/10.",

      "name": "Morten Tyldum&apos;s espionage thriller about Alan Turing is purely sensational with a performance for the ages by Benedict Cumberbatch...",
      "reviewBody": "It took a little over 24 hours before I weighed in on my official thoughts on Morten Tyldum&apos;s The Imitation Game from The Weinstein Company. My initial reaction upon leaving the screening room was it was astonishing, a magnificent achievement that stands tall as one of the year&apos;s best movies. As the film continues to settle within my cinematic soul, this very well could be the best film of the year, anchored by a career best performance from the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch. \n\nFull disclosure, I&apos;m fairly oblivious to European history and the heroes that had a hand in one of the deadliest wars in history. I&apos;ve heard the name Alan Turing from high school and college but either didn&apos;t care enough to learn or have no recollection of his contributions. Minutes following the screening, Amazon.com got $15.82 from my bank account in order to read &quot;Alan Turing: The Enigma,&quot; the book in which screenwriter Graham Moore based the story upon. Telling the story of Alan Turing, a mathematician who in 1939 led a pioneer in cracking one of the most difficult codes in history. His contributions paved the way for essentially the way we exist now. However, Turing, who is a homosexual, has to wrestle with his secret in order to keep his status and his work years later.\n\nMasterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum&apos;s film is both engrossing and disturbing. It has genius aspirations in which it wants to exist in the cinematic world. It&apos;s an impeccable thriller, taut and brilliant, exploring the horrors of war along with the choices that doom mankind for all eternity. Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic. Screenwriter Moore crafts a murky, dark, yet totally enjoyable spy film that stands taller than any James Bond film ever released. It&apos;s a sure-fire Oscar contender for several Academy Awards including Best Picture. They should feel so lucky to have the gumption to choose something this methodical and majestic.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch continues to climb the ladder as one of the best actors working today. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV&apos;s &quot;Sherlock,&quot; this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. Oscar-winner or not, this will be looked upon like the greats such as Gene Hackman in The French Connection or any legendary 70&apos;s movie that you love today. Cumberbatch hones in on all of Turing&apos;s character flaws and good qualities that make him a real person. He constructs him from the toes up, inflicting mannerisms and behaviors that all ring true. He stimulates all the sensual beats that keep us fixated on a performance. I can&apos;t help but go back to someone like Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, who delivered a construction of epic proportions. Though based on a real person, the talented Cumberbatch ignites his own masterpiece performance. He follows the demons of Turing down to his bones. Unsure, arrogant, and dismissive to the world around him, Turing shows only what he must, what he chooses, and every once in a while, we get a front seat to his soul. Thank you Cumberbatch.\n\nThe rest of the cast is completely on their game. It&apos;s probably a contender for the SAG Ensemble prize. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley, as the feisty and fiery Joan Clark, is as loose and comfortable as I&apos;ve ever seen her. She wears Joan like an old coat from the back of the closet. Remembering it fondly and seeing that it fits just perfect. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film. \n\nI don&apos;t know when it&apos;s going to happen but the world needs to make Matthew Goode a mega-star. In his brief time on-screen, Goode makes his mark, becoming essentially a co-anchor with Knightley of the supporting players, showcasing a reason to give this guy his own leading role sooner rather than later. As our resident sleazy authority figure, Charles Dance shows that he&apos;s still got it. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine.\n\nTechnical merits are no shortage of excellence on display. Oscar- winning Editor William Goldenberg (Argo) shows that tension is his second language. Cutting the film to perfection, and forcing your heart into throat, this espionage thriller succeeds for general audiences because of Goldenberg&apos;s efforts. It&apos;s something that anyone can seek out and get fully immersed into. Alexandre Desplat tacks another impressive composition to his already thick resume. With films like The Grand Budapest Hotel already in his arsenal, I assume this to be another Oscar citation in his future. Shot by the talented Oscar Faura, responsible for painting the canvas that was J.A. Bayona&apos;s The Impossible, he utilizes the standard brilliance of capturing a moment. Knows when to pull back and get close. Let&apos;s not forget the Production and Costume Design by Maria Djurkovic and Sammy Sheldon Differ. Those two will surely be mentioned for the rest of the film year.\n\nThe Imitation Game is assertive and makes a serious claim as one of the best spy thrillers ever made. There are sub plots that all resonate and never feel forced. This will not only keep your tension level at a fever pitch but could leave you in tears to walk home with. It&apos;s a complete realistic view at the spy game that stands as one of the best films of the year and a performance for the ages from Benedict Cumberbatch. A captivating achievement that I&apos;ll likely remember for some time.",

      "reviewBody": "If I could sum this movie up in one sentence, it would be this: Go Will. Will Smith is the driving force of I Am Legend. His performance as Dr. Robert Neville is impeccable. Living in a deserted NY city, his acting is reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away, but instead of a volleyball, he has mannequins and a faithful German Shepard named Sam. His basement, a retro-fitted, high-tech lab to find a cure for the disease that has turned the population of the entire planet into mutant, zombie-like, hive mind, blood-thirsty monsters, and, for some reason, Robert is immune. His days, spent hunting. His nights, sleeping with a high-powered rifle and hoping that the mutants don&apos;t find him. Keeping the movie flowing are well placed flashbacks that show what happened to Robert&apos;s family and why he is there. The movie falters a bit at the end, maybe at the last 5 minutes, but it doesn&apos;t ruin the plot or acting put forth. Containing wonderful cinematography and CG, I Am Legend is a spectacular film that I will be seeing again! PS - Shout out to my NY National Guardsmen in this film! Great job!",

      "reviewBody": "Saw &apos;Doctor Strange&apos; (although fairly late perhaps) because of liking the cast a great deal, who can argue with Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton, and having liked a lot of what Marvel has done, something that one doesn&apos;t see people saying a lot here.\n\n&apos;Doctor Strange&apos; is not a perfect film, but to me it was a thoroughly enjoyable one and is one of Marvel&apos;s best. Lets begin with the things that from personal opinion didn&apos;t quite work. Rachel McAdams does do a good job with what she has, but the character was underused and underwritten. Her screen time, while essential, was not large and her development was sketchy at best. Strange mastering magic does happen too fast, didn&apos;t buy how rushed that aspect was, and while there are a lot of fun and witty moments a few jokes felt random and out of place (i.e. Beyoncé).\n\nHowever, the cast are a major asset. Had reservations about McAdams&apos;s character but not with her performance. Benedict Cumberbatch really makes the interesting title character his own and knocks it out the park. The standout of the rest of the cast is Tilda Swinton, wonderfully mysterious as the film&apos;s most interesting character and played with relish by her.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor has a charismatic intensity and Benedict Wong has fun and enjoyed his chemistry with Cumberbatch. Do think that the villain Kaecilius could have been explored in more depth, but Mads Mikkelsen is intriguingly menacing.\n\nThe story, making the most of a great innovative concept, is never dull and is told with absorbing atmosphere, exuberance and very rarely sacrifices coherence or credulity. There are some really interesting ideas here, explored with thought-provoking intelligence. The action excites and thrills, as well as being visually stunning, instead of being drawn out even though quite long the climax is great fun to watch (or at least it was to me).\n\n&apos;Doctor Strange&apos;s&apos; script has emotion, wit and tension and although he doesn&apos;t have the character growth one would like Strange is a well realised character and Cumberbatch has a lot to thank for that. The music score has great intensity, rousing excitement and nuance and Scott Derrickson clearly engaged hugely with the material.\n\nWhere &apos;Doctor Strange&apos; is particularly good is in the production values. It&apos;s very stylishly shot and edited and handsomely mounted in production design but it&apos;s the incredible special effects (particularly jaw-dropping in the climax) that take centre stage.\n\nOverall, while not quite finding it a masterpiece of film-making and having a few problems with it &apos;Doctor Strange&apos; was a thoroughly enjoyable film and among Marvel&apos;s best. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "I have seen this movie only recently (2005) and it&apos;s easily one of the better foreign films I have seen. Actually, it&apos;s probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen.\n\nThe characters really make this movie come alive with each of their compelling personalities shining though in the backdrop of oppressive conditions and constant violence. One thing which clearly comes to mind is &quot;Lil&apos; Dice&apos;s&quot; ear to ear smile - so vivid and yet so ironic since he personifies pure evil.\n\nThe City of God is a world you don&apos;t want to visit, it won&apos;t be featured on a post card, and it&apos;s said to be the city ignored by god himself. This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, puts you on the edge of your seat -- you are right into the middle of the City and you too are caught up in it&apos;s violent temptation. More importantly, it&apos;s about the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.\n\nThis movie in effect is fast paced and hard to follow (with the added stress of subtitles over Portuguese), but it&apos;s worth it; and in fact really adds to the impetuous and impulsive undertones of the movie. In addition, the quintessential Brazilian music blending into the film like a well made Caprahina makes it feel authentic like the Italian music in the God Father.\n\nYou see the flaws of these men played out in an almost fatalistic nature -- hated, greed, futility; and in it all we see ourselves, our own flaws, and our own condition.",

      "name": "The Last Crusade is the best of the Indy trilogy.",
      "reviewBody": "Rating: **** out of ****\n\nMy opinion of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade could be deemed slightly biased. It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it&apos;s also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same, worn-down, beat-up copy (and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition, for sentimental reasons, of course) (but nothing beats the pristine quality DVD). I think it&apos;s fair to say it&apos;s this movie that cemented my love of cinema, the high regard I hold for great escapism, which is sorely lacking from today&apos;s cinema; movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentlessly awful scripts or MTV-style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old, but I think I can safely say they don&apos;t make them like they used to.\n\nThe film stars, of course, Harrison Ford as Indy Jones, the archaeologist/adventurer who&apos;s on yet another quest, this time to find his father, who&apos;d been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery, whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film, acting-wise, above the others in the trilogy by giving Ford a genuine acting equal (let me put it this way, he&apos;s only half a notch below Harrison Ford/Indy in charisma and appeal if that tells you anything). The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son (eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody), complete with amazing action and stunt sequences, clever humor, and nasty (but fun) surprises.\n\nThe script, by Jeffrey Boam, takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but actually improves upon that story by paying more attention to characterization. The delightful opening scene (all three movies really open with a bang, don&apos;t they?); which details how young Indy got his scar, whip, hat, and fear of snakes; makes for a better prequel than Temple of Doom (and any of The Adventure of Young Indiana Jones, for that matter).\n\nThe story is engrossing because there&apos;s a lot of fun clues offered towards the location of the Grail and, thus, there&apos;s a lot of engaging little discoveries (love the &quot;X marks the spot&quot; scene). I&apos;m quite certain, like with Raiders of the Lost Ark, the plot has a few holes, but they&apos;re fairly hard to notice, and I&apos;ve seen this movie quite a few times, but maybe it&apos;s just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up. Either way, it speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg&apos;s direction and the performances.\n\nGiven that action and adventure is the series&apos; selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams&apos; rousing, memorable score, also the best of the trilogy), the best being a fantastic ten-minute chase sequence on board (and in) a tank, possibly the best action sequence of Spielberg&apos;s career. I also loved the motorcycle chase and the Zeppelin setpiece, where the heroes go about dispatching of two enemy fighters in unexpected, but quite hilarious, fashion. The climax, complete with frightening booby traps, is a suspenseful venture into the unknown.\n\nThe Last Crusade is far more humor-oriented than its predecessors, but part of the movie&apos;s effectiveness is that it&apos;s able to deliver belly laughs without defusing the tension during the action sequences. Some of the jokes are just brilliant, including one with Indy armed with a Luger in confrontation with a trio of Nazis on board a tank that&apos;s even funnier than the swordsman scene in Raiders (well, to me, at least).\n\nThe supporting cast is all-around superb; John Rhys-Davies is back as Sallah, wonderful as ever and displaying a bit more enthusiasm searching for the Grail than he did digging up the Ark of the Covenant. The late Denholm Elliot also returns as Marcus Brody, the most lovable goof of a museum curator. Alison Doody is interesting as Elsa, the blonde historian whom Indy falls for; a twist involving her character and her actions towards the climax make her not as one-dimensional as she may initially appear. Julian Glover is the best of the main Indy villains, he&apos;s far more menacing than Paul Freeman&apos;s Belloq and less over-the-top but equally enjoyable as Amrish Pruri&apos;s Mola Ram. I also enjoyed Michael Byrne&apos;s performance as the Jones hating Colonel Vogel, who relishes in torturing Indy and his father. When it comes to pure delightfully nasty villainy, Byrne is even more fun to watch than Glover.\n\nHarrison Ford delivers his best Indy performance (maybe even his best performance, period) in this particular adventure. With the addition of Connery as his father, it reveals a personal side to Indy we haven&apos;t seen before. It&apos;s his rapport with Connery that separates this film from the rest of the genre. They craft an uncannily touching, funny, and genuine bond. That, coupled with the superb action and thrills, solidifies The Last Crusade as the pinnacle of high adventure summer entertainment."

Through humor and deep emotions, this film shows us that people are complicated and life is unpredictable.\n\nSuch films are rare, and nowadays they are almost non-existent. The development of the main character and the depiction of his emotions and internal conflict are interesting, which is exactly the basis of the film.\n\nThere is also a bit of humor in the film, located exactly where it should be and thus creates that necessary balance against the cruel reality.\n\nThe script is brilliant, and Clint Eastwood turned it into a great film, managing to evoke tension and feelings, as well as the inner struggle of the characters.\n\nThe film is superbly directed and easily guides the viewer through the story. The cinematography is excellent, as is the photography. The soundtrack fits perfectly into the atmosphere of the film.\n\nThis is an old-fashioned drama with interesting characters that are not one-dimensional but complicated and layered. Unfortunately, the actor who plays the character of Thao is simply not a good actor, but the rest of the cast played their parts excellently.\n\nI was particularly impressed by Ahney Her in the role of Sue, and Clint Eastwood is equally excellent in the role of Walt Kowalski. Also, Christopher Carley excellently portrayed the character of Father Janovich, a young and somewhat naive priest, whose character is also interesting and develops throughout the film.\n\nA great, powerful and inspiring film.",

I grew up, got busy with life but those priceless timeless beautiful storytelling moments that I once shared, that amazed me in wonder, curiosity, imagination and desire to know more..\n\nI know if I think hard enough I might remember some of them, but that&apos;s not the point. The point is all those stories had characters and people and objects and places and things that I could either imagine or something that I could picture and understand and visualize in my young mind. If not for those imaginable characters and people, I would have never understood those stories, the true meaning of the story, the actual story behind the story that my dad probably wanted me to understand.\n\nArrival, for me is such a story. Aliens are just fun characters that help me understand the story so I can actually see beyond it and understand the untold story. You see, the way I understand it is that the director had to dumb it down for us and wrap this movie in a sci-fi genre and add aliens so you could relate it to something you are familiar with and hoped, really hoped that we try to understand the true purpose, the message behind all this. It simply couldn&apos;t have been portrayed better than this!\n\nThis movie teaches you a lot of things, if you are ready to learn. About &apos;time&apos; and how much we are bound by it, about life and death, about loving unconditionally, about believing in yourself that everything happens for a reason, and so much more..",

The base that they used in England looks very much like Parris Island, right down to the Grinder and the barracks in the background. The part where they are running on the road with Joker carrying Pyle looks like the road to Elliots Beach. The Cadence is true to life as well as Senior Drill Instructor Hartmans dialect, all of the comments I can say 100% that I have heard on The Island and had them used on me. For a person who was there it had me fooled, although the O-Course and the rifle range are completely different in layout and looks. The inside of the barracks and the head are identical to the real thing. For anyone viewing this film trust me it doesn&apos;t get any closer to being Parris Island and I would say that the &quot;Gunny&quot; saw to that. As far as the in country segment it looks pretty much like the real photos I saw in USMC training films."

Very well written screenplay with all loose ends tied up together and reasonable foreshadowing and morals that echoes throughout, but there weren&apos;t any striking moments even to the point of final reveal, possibly due to the addition of yet more details approaching the end in an attempt to create a (slightly) forced satisfying end. Unnecessary characters and scenes that serve little to no purpose in the story other than for comedic effect were present, which maybe one of the reasons why audience may have a sense of emptyness when leaving the theatre. Nonetheless, Knives Out remains a fresh form of storytelling that is trying to achieve and convey more than your ordinary murder mystery.",

      "reviewBody": "If I was to use one word to describe this film it would  have to be....Violent! if i was allowed two words I would add  &apos;Visceral&apos;.  The movie is two hours long and is structured in a similar way to Pulp  Fiction. A bunch of stories set in a consistent world, with characters  falling in and out of each others plot lines. On the whole it works  brilliantly, and for the duration there isn&apos;t a boring moment. It is  High octane, million miles and hour storytelling, and it EASILY Robert  Rodriguez&apos;s best film.  Allowing Frank Miller to write the script was a fantastic move, as the  dialogue is edgy, witty and VERY faithful to the original material. In  fact, many many lines are just taken straight from the pages. likewise,  the camera behaves like a moving cartoon box out. The framing of all  the key scenes is SO faithful to the printed page that it produces a  truly original look that is fairly incomparable. Visually its a true  original. Sometimes these visuals fall down, there are some very very  obvious digital shots that don&apos;t quite gel, but on the whole the  cinematography is jaw dropping. You could literally pause the movie at  almost any point and just hang that frame on a wall, its that  beautiful.  Performances are good all round. Mickey Rourke absolutely nails Marv,  and the girls of Old Town are all as beautiful as they are deadly. The  other standout for me was Elijah Wood, who was truly chilling. Bruce  Willis puts in a solid, if unspectacular turn as Hartigan.  The film isn&apos;t entirely void of criticism. there&apos;s some fudging of time  lines with Hartigans character (do we really buy Bruce Willis as a  nearly 70 year old man?) and the jumps from story to story are jarring  initially, but once it settles into itself the ride is fantastic.  My other main criticism is the same I have with Quentin Tarantinos  work. That every character and every voice in the movie is the same.  This is more a fault of the source material, but when every single  person is a wise cracking, hard boiled tough guy (even the women) then  it kind of distills the effect of their toughness. In a film that is  predominantly voice over driven, it is hard to differentiate characters  when they all sound exactly the same, both tonally, and in the language  they use. Even Marv, who&apos;s supposed to be a meat head, talks in  gravelly prose that would make Bukowski feel like a Nancy.  Other Minor niggles are hardly worth mentioning. From a technical  standpoint the sound effects are WAY to loud. All of the punches,  gunshots etc are given such ridiculous prominence on the track that  they threaten to make mockery of the violence. I actually found that i  didn&apos;t want any more guns fired cos it was hurting my ears! all in all  though, its one hell of a ride, and only a couple of notches below Pulp  Fiction on the &apos;Oh my god that film was cool-o-meter&apos;."

      "reviewBody": "Quill finds his real father.\n\nThis is an enjoyable adventure with great humour and character moments.\n\nThe story is pretty threadbare outside of the development of characters like Quill, Yondu, Ego, and Nebula but this provides enough entertainment on its own. Written into most scenes are strong themes about family and friendship. What it means to be a parent. Surrogate parents and families. Estranged children searching for parental figures and family.\n\nOf course it&apos;s all done with a great sense of humour, as characters like Drax, Mantis, Rocket, and Groot light up the screen with strong verbal and visual comedy.\n\nQuill doesn&apos;t massively develop as a character, but we do learn more about his origins and powers. Alongside this the Guardians are portrayed as developing a family dynamic. This is great idea given they are all depicted as coming from traumatic beginnings.\n\nEgo is an interesting character and fantastic visualisation of an outlandish graphic-novel concept. It is not particularly subtle, but the character epitomises an extreme version of the in-built selfish drives present in everyone. Kurt Russell is on great form.\n\nThe contrasting father figure of Yondu is written particularly well. He has been portrayed as having egotistical characteristics too, but here is given a huge redemption arc with with moments of great altruism. It is great to see Michael Rooker playing this type of character. He is as stereotypically violent and generally aggressive as in his previous roles, but for once he gets to show some heart.\n\nNebula and Gamora have solid moments of relationship development. These scenes all tie in well to the movie&apos;s main themes and are important to the overarching narrative of the MCU, particularly when watching The Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. Karen Gillan and Zoe Zaldana both give strong performances, especially Gillan who is a consistently strong performer in the MCU.\n\nVisually it is a colourful feast for the eyes and full of exciting spectacle as you would expect from a space adventure. For me the CGI action is a little too much on occasions and distracts from the story, but doesn&apos;t spoil my enjoyment of the movie. It generally tells the story through its cinematography and editing. Being a Guardians movie it has a great soundtrack of course with many a well placed song.",

Johnny Depp once again proves why he&apos;s the only man alive who can play the role of Cap. Jack Sparrow. There&apos;s a great number of returning characters from the first film - including a couple I was very happy to see again.\n\nMy only fault was perhaps that this film lack a certain &apos;heart&apos; that the first film had, which I believe came because the first film was something very different, which of course this film couldn&apos;t contend with.\n\nThat aside, you will hardly notice it. There&apos;s a good plot, wonderful sets, great acting and plenty of laughs. One of the best films I&apos;ve seen all year thus far - can&apos;t wait for the 3rd one!",

      "reviewBody": "In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, &quot;Son, your ego&apos;s writing checks your body can&apos;t cash.&quot; Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete &quot;Maverick&quot; Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he&apos;s as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he&apos;s ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise&apos;s regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They&apos;re tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, &quot;Hold My Hand.&quot; It&apos;s nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie&apos;s &quot;Take My Breath Away,&quot; but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you&apos;re really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that&apos;s because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he&apos;s trying to show us that there&apos;s room for the old and the new to coexist. He&apos;s also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.",

A phenomenal, fearless performance by Christian Bale that, in a way, cleared up my questions about this versatile British actor. I could never quite warm up to him. Not even in &quot;Little Women&quot;. Now, Bale as Patrick Bateman, revealed the reason. It is the cruelty around his mouth. His smiles are chilling and they work to perfection in this, his yuppie modern monster.His actions have the pristine shallowness of his business cards and the disgusting taste of his self awareness. You don&apos;t feel sorry for him, the way one did for Norman Bates. No, his character is unredeemable. His rough sex with two women while he rides one of them looking at himself in the mirror is one of the most disturbing film moments I&apos;ve ever seen. I wonder if Bale will ever be able to play goodness, convincingly.",

Well no but in terms of the genre it&apos;s self? I&apos;m giving it a perfect 5 out of 5 Stars... Hell continuity was even good, the dialog was sound and had moments of humor at every beat, and Keanu actually shows some range... Yeah you heard that right, raaaaange.... Not only that Mr. Wick even takes time to reload again everything just worked perfectly with this movie... I don&apos;t have anything to nitpick... The supporting cast was even good, this is a perfect fun action movie.... Dammit I gotta see this again.

I couldn&apos;t detect their soul or any evidence of its existence. In a way they represent the worst of the previous generations. Roman Emperors or Wall Street. Profit is the name of the game and the ideas come out of boredom of longings to get laid. Love and friendship, loyalty and/or honor as obsolete as good manners. Jesse Eisenberg is chillingly perfect as the humanoid that started it all - or did he? - Justin Timberlake keeps surprising me. Good, very good and Andrew Garfield, the most recognizable of the characters is a victim of sorts and he&apos;ll be destroyed no matter how much money he gets.

      "reviewBody": "Roberto Benigni&apos;s Vita e bella, is in many ways similar to Chaplin&apos;s Great Dictator.  Both are comic attacks on fascism, but the former&apos;s is the more successful.  Benigni initially accesses the emotions of his audience through simple comedy, which is a pleasant mix of Keaton and Chaplin.  Romance ensues with his real life wife Nicoletta Braschi.  The first half of this film has been seen by various critics as being inferior to the second, but this is certainly not the case.  In the first section we follow the delightful romance that will eventually lead to marriage and the creation of the wonderful Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini).\n\nIt is the first half where the audience can laugh the loudest and delight at the immense comedy talent of Benigni.  Unlike so many films nowadays there is nothing crude or course, his is simple innocent humour, which is all the more effective.  The way he ties together little strand in the film to create comedy elements shows a great writing ability, and a mastery of timing when it comes to their execution on screen.  Various incidents related to the rise of anti-semitism and fascism in Italy show that there are sinister forces at work which come to the fore in the second segment.\n\nGuido (Benigni) moves events on from Tuscany in 1939 to the last year of the war in a concentration camp.  In this period he and Dora (Braschi) have had their son Giosue (Cantanarini).  The five year old greatly reminds me of Toto in Cinema Paradiso, and plays an equally important role in his prospective film (though in Paradiso&apos;s case it is at the beginning of the movie).  The relationship between the two is very similar to that of Jackie Coogan and Charlie Chaplin (though Benigni, unlike Chaplin, keeps the best of the comedy moments).  Guido attempts to keep from the boy the horrors of what is going on, and this eventually manifests itself as a game where the aim is to score 100 points, with the winner winning a real tank (which, of course appeals to the young boy).  Comic moments are still present, that involving Guido&apos;s translation of the rules of the camp is particularly notable, but it becomes somewhat more difficult to laugh when we consider the gravity of what is going on.\n\nThe emphasis begins shifts, and we realise that this is a film about human spirit above all else.  Guido not only appeals to the audience due to his comedy and sheer pleasantness, but also in the way that he loves his family and the measures that he will go to to protect them.\n\nThis is certainly no Schindler&apos;s List, but it never pretends to be. Occasionally events seem a little contrived, but this does seem to work in the film&apos;s favour.  However, this film avoids the tendency of Hollywood to go far over the top in emotional and credibility terms.\n\nBenigni shines like a lantern throughout the picture, showing that he is a talent, not only in comedy terms, that far outshines his peers.  Cantanari is a delight, and Braschi also plays her part well.  There is even an appearance by The Magnificent Seven&apos;s Horst Buchholz as Doctor Lessing, a man who events change for the worse.\n\nPlease don&apos;t let the fact that it, to all but the Italians, is a foreign language film.  The language itself adds a beauty of form to the film, much as it did in the case of Il Postino.  This has to be a certainty for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, though something tells me that it will be overlooked for other awards as it is Italian and not a mainstream English language picture.\n\nPlease see this film, and make up your own mind.  It is appealing in so many different ways that I&apos;m sure that you will not be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Shrek&quot; is fun. People who haven&apos;t seen this movie, and are wary of seeing what&apos;s popular, should give it a try. It&apos;s worth watching, and will probably win you over.\n\nTaking a Fractured Fairy Tale approach to a &quot;Beauty And The Beast&quot;-type plot, throwing in a few mild profanities, flatulence jokes, and Michael Myers&apos; over-the-top faux-Scots accent, &quot;Shrek&quot; shows off a very snarky humor, full of jokes that will likely go over the heads of a cartoon&apos;s target audience while registering with their parents. &apos;Sure it&apos;s big enough, but look at the location,&apos; Shrek observes upon seeing a giant castle in the middle of nowhere. The kids, though, will love &apos;Shrek&apos; every bit as much. It&apos;s impossible not to be carried along by its merry madness.\n\nMyers, as the title character, is certainly easier to take than he was in his last Austin Powers movie, his voice work registering real tenderness as well as the expected laughs as a misunderstood ogre who would rather tell a group of frightened villagers about the cruelties he will inflict on them and their dead bodies than cause those villagers any genuine harm. He&apos;s a bit of a softie, actually, and scared to let anyone know it.\n\nCameron Diaz is as beautiful to listen to hear as she is to look at in her other films. Her character, Princess Fiona, doesn&apos;t have as much room to shine as Shrek (the balance turns out better in the sequel) but she does well with what she&apos;s given.\n\nThe comic highpoints in terms of voice characterization is Eddie Murphy as Shrek&apos;s donkey companion and John Lithgow as nasty Lord Farquaad, who wants to rid his domain of Duloc of all fairy tale creatures. Murphy never stops being funny even as he helps set up key plot moments; in fact he&apos;s never been this funny since the first &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; movie. &quot;We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I&apos;m making waffles,&quot; the donkey tells a much put-upon Shrek, and you still laugh the fifth time you hear it. Lithgow just makes you smile whenever he opens his mouth, like when he grills a hapless gingerbread man in such a convoluted way it turns into a nursery-rhyme recitation.\n\nWhy exactly Farquaad is grilling this gingerbread man so closely isn&apos;t clear, and there are similar plot holes throughout the movie. Shrek may be too tame a character; we never really feel any worry around him. The donkey falls into a relationship with a dragon that screams &quot;plot convenience,&quot; and there are strange little bits of cruelty, like turning a frog and snake into balloons, which just is thrown out there and let be.\n\nBut the central story, about how Shrek and Fiona struggle to overcome the odds and find true love, is really sweet and well-rendered. The animation is spectacular, a revolution for the eyes in its deep-dish panoramas and remarkable attention to textures. And the jokes keep flying, the major ones as well as hilarious bits of filigree you won&apos;t notice the first or second time but reward you for paying attention.\n\nThis is not a Disney movie, something &quot;Shrek&quot; makes very clear not only with its PG-13 humor but its knocks at Disney characters like Snow White and at the Magic Kingdom in the form of Duloc, where an array of &quot;It&apos;s A Small World&quot;-type dolls lecture Shrek and Donkey on all the things NOT to do. Frankly, &quot;Shrek&quot; could use a little injection of Disney heart, but Disney could use some of this picture&apos;s freshness as well. A very charming movie worth your time.",

      "name": "A technical masterpiece that is nearly devoid of palpable emotion and compelling characters.",
      "reviewBody": "Might as well get right to it, then. At the risk of sounding like a contrarian, I did not love this film. Do I love elements of this? Yes. Is this a 5-star masterpiece? Unfortunately, no. \n\nThe cinematography here at least, is masterful. Director Christopher Nolan has, without a doubt, reached the pinnacle of on-screen spectacle here. The feats of practical effects in this film are breathtaking. The casting of nearly 6,000 extras, authentic WWII vehicles, and shooting on location in Dunkirk, France contribute to a great sense of scale here. There is ongoing trend of action films in recent years of relying on CGI, and thankfully Nolan bucks that trend. \n\nSimilar to War for the Planet of the Apes, much of the film plays out without much dialogue, leaning on just the score and sound design in most scenes. It almost goes without saying that Hans Zimmer delivers with another incredible score. The sound design is also extremely well crafted, which, paired with Nolan&apos;s great work behind the camera, truly transports you to the Battle of Dunkirk. The wailing of planes passing above, the drone of gunfire, and the roar of explosions all contribute to the complete immersion into the world these characters are trapped in. This results in some of the most immersive wartime action scenes since Saving Private Ryan.\n\nThis film has and will continue to be compared to World War II classic Saving Private Ryan. Both films are beautifully filmed WWII period pieces with casts that deliver great performances. The similarities end there. Whereas Saving Private Ryan was engrossing as a narrative due to it&apos;s characters with depth and arcs, Dunkirk instead leans on it&apos;s subject matter and spectacle.\n\nAnd while the subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating, as a film it lacks emotional firepower due to the absence of a strongly written protagonist. This is strangely uncharacteristic of a director of Nolan&apos;s caliber, especially when you recall the complex character work in his most acclaimed films: The Dark Knight, Memento, and The Prestige. Instead of focusing on a single character or single group of characters, the focus is spread across three protagonists in completely different situations. Showing the Dunkirk Evacuation through the three different perspectives of those on the beach, the sea, and the air is only an interesting proposition on paper. The narrative, due to this writing choice, is spread far too thin, with few characters getting enough screen time to develop even the mildest emotional connection.\n\nWhile the characters in this film aren&apos;t written to even remotely be compelling, the great work from this cast is not to be overlooked. Harry Styles, known for being a member of English boy band One Direction, is surprisingly excellent here in his acting debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given. \n\nI should love this film. Historical drama? WWII setting? My favorite director Christopher Nolan? Amazing cinematography? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk&apos;s lack of emotional connection severely detracts from the awe-inspiring scope and technical prowess displayed. \n\nIf I reviewed based on visuals alone, this is a slam-dunk, walk-off home run of a 5-star film. While a focus on grandeur and situation over character depth and emotion may work for some (it obviously worked for 98% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes), it did not work for this critic.\n\nThis is without a doubt a cinematic achievement, but without an emotional core, it&apos;s impossible for this film not to feel cold and empty. Despite being a technical masterpiece, this is Christopher Nolan&apos;s most disappointing film yet.",

Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt form a perfect chemistry that takes them from the training ground, to the battlefield through to the action-bound finale in Paris. The premise of the time-loop has been used many times before, but this time round there are enough exciting visuals and dynamic storytelling skills employed to make this one thrilling (and unexpectedly comedic) flick that is unpredictable and expertly designed.

They set out on their trip and...well the rest is really left for the viewer to discover. Writer-director Jordan Peele shows his master craftsmanship by taking this simple premise and expanding it in many different directions, also incorporating elements of racism, comedy, shock and awe, and wisely never taking things too seriously. The climax is a bit formulaic and over-the-top, but the journey is effectively unnerving and features much stronger acting than you would expect for a film of this genre. Not for everyone, but refreshingly unconventional and worth the viewing experience. ***"

Additionally, seeing more of Henry Cavill&apos;s Superman saving people is always welcome.\n\nNot all of the problems are fixed as the unnecessarily destructive third act is obviously still present as is the forced franchise set-up that still feels very clunky.

That&apos;s what I feel at the moment.\n\nI rate it as Mann&apos;s best. It&apos;s his most kinetic,vibrant(for a film mostly shot in steely blue),agonising,stirring,brash,violent and brilliance in such a simple story. \n\nWhat games did you play as a young kid? Cops and robbers.Good guy.Bad guy.\n\nWe all know De Niro and Pacino could have been either main part,but can you imagine it any other way round. Pacino doing ice cool calm? De Niro the manic outbursts,arms flailing? It wouldn&apos;t work. We know these men now.We know neither will stop at what they do.And yet there is no way either would stop the other.Unless they had too. Which leads us too the characters. All of them.\n\nThis is an extended family where you feel you know all of them without knowing anything at all. The cops are similar to the robbers and vice-versa. Perhaps Mann is telling us were all the same.Except in what we do.Every speaking part holds substance in this movie, and the support cast is astonishing when you actually read the caliber of who appeared in this film.Tom Sizmore, Val Kilmer,Ashley Judd,Ted Levine,Wes Studi,Hank Azaria,William Fitchner,Henry Rollins,Dennis Haysbert,Tom Noonan. And Natalie Portman, for chrissake! Try getting that cast again.\n\nA real 10/10 film. And that Moby song at the end(God moving over the face of waters) gets me every time.",

Brad Pitt is very good as an agent living a normal life until the crisis calls him out of his retirement.

I learned a lot about the story as well as the abilities he has. \n\nAntman gets much more interesting when doing combat. The ability to shrink and grow at will is something Marvel has gotten very creative with. \n\nThe language in this film is good enough for my young children to watch.

      "reviewBody": "This is without a doubt THE movie that launched Jennifer into stardom. And deservedly so! For all those who love Jennifer Lawrence and for some unexplicable reason havent yet seen this gem there is only advice: stop reading this review and start watching!\n\nBut this movie is much much more than just a fun filled Jennifer flick, because David O Russel wrote and directed this crazy love classic, a movie about 2 people who are crazy and in love. The guy is played by Bradley Cooper and besides his other role in &quot;American Hustle&quot; I truly feel that this is his best performance ever.\n\nAll David O Russell pictures are about families in chaos. Utter chaos. BUT despite all the chaos and craziness in David O Russell&apos;s pictures there is always a true love at the heart to be found. That is what makes Russell&apos;s pictures so endearingly huggable, loveable and crazy positive. It is so touching and uplifting to see the craziest dysfunctional people fall in love and support eachother despite all their sorrows, fights and utter craziness.\n\nTerrific supporting role by Robert de Niro! Splendid soundtrack. Great story. What more could one wish for? It is the craziest christmas feel good film I have ever seen. Gotta see this one!",

      "reviewBody": "Infinitely better than the first (which I liked) because of better action, humor and emotion. All those people who were worried about Thor being underpowered are going to be pleased. The effects are wonderful and it is indeed a very funny and a very moving movie in places. I&apos;m happy to report that neither factor is overused or gets in the way of the feel or story. It&apos;s the right amount of humor and right amount of angst. Cinematography is great and the score is amazing. Whoever scored this film should do so for the rest of the Marvel movies in my opinion.\n\nI knew they would nail the pathos but was pleasantly surprised by the creative fight sequences. They are phenomenal. Not overly long but when they rage, THEY RAGE. Also, Kurse can rival the Hulk in terms of scary power. He was better utilized than the Destroyer was in the first film. Loki is the scene stealer that was all hoped to see! Jane and Sif add more than eye candy but you would expect no less from Marvel. Hemsworth has cemented his legend as Thor with this effort. My only real disappointed is a minor one. They didn&apos;t really show the nine realms in any real detail. It seemed a cop out that hey&apos;re just open landscapes. Yet, maybe they didn&apos;t want to commit to anything for future movies.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful movie and maybe Marvel&apos;s best solo film."

Javier Bardem is great as a baddie, though he could have used a bit more background. He is over the top, but it suits the genre. In comparison, we get more background for Bond and M.\n\nThe plot is good and has a good flow to it, though the movie feels ever so slightly bloated in the beginning and the end. The action is well paced and free of annoying shaky-cam work. The dialogue is witty (more so than usual), though too much of the good stuff is given away in the trailer. It definitely feels less of a Jason Bourne movie than the last two.\n\nLocation-wise, Skyfall spends more time in Britain than any other in the series as far as I can recall. I like this change and it&apos;s nice to see more of MI6.\n\nIn all it&apos;s well worth watching and a great Bond movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I must say, I was worried about this one. Catching Fire is my favorite book of the trilogy, but cinematically it makes absolutely no sense. The Hunger Games reads like a screenplay--Catching Fire is a meandery epic full of worldbuilding and exposition for a war that won&apos;t even begin until Mockingjay. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that this installment of the hit franchise, directed by industry rookie Francis Lawrence, was maybe even more engaging than its predecessor.\n\nVisually, it is a feat. The attention to detail is remarkable. Lawrence, along with screenwriters Michael Hardt and Suzanne Collins herself, manages to weave in all of the necessary set up to the upcoming war against The Capitol without it feeling tedious or heavy-handed. The new additions to the cast, most notably Philip Seymor Hoffman&apos;s Plutarch Heavensbee and Sam Claflin&apos;s Finnick O&apos;Dair, are excellent, and the dialogue is much less wooden than, forgive me, the dialogue in the books sometimes is. Moreover, it is impressive that even with so many new people and so many moving parts, the central thread of Rebellion shines through.\n\nOf course, with so much plot, so much to set up, one can hardly blame Catching Fire for falling short in the emotional department--as is, it clocks in at 2 hours and 26 minutes--but I did find myself wanting some steamier Peeta/Katniss action. I was disappointed by Lawrence&apos;s apparent disregard for the relationship between Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence, no relation) and Peeta (the incomparable Josh Hutcherson). To me, Catching Fire is about Peeta. It&apos;s the Peeta show.\n\nHere&apos;s the thing: Katniss is supposed to be conflicted, not indifferent about Peeta. In the paper version, the reader, and by extension Katniss herself, feels truly torn between Gale and Peeta. She can&apos;t help but slowly fall in love with Peeta, who is so charming and funny and relentlessly Good. In this iteration, Katniss and Peeta have little to no chemistry, and Peeta only speaks when it is necessary to move the plot forward. Gale, on the other hand, is 6&apos;4 and literally a Hemsworth. That he is a Hemsworth is no one&apos;s fault, I guess, but maybe Peeta should have been allowed to say some of the cute stuff he says in the books.\n\nThe &quot;adults&quot; in the cast--Woody Harrelson&apos;s Haymitch and Donald Sutherland&apos;s President Snow have much meatier roles than they do in the books. To their credit, they are fantastic. But I can&apos;t help but wonder how much more potent this movie could have been if Lawrence had trusted his young stars a bit more with the emotional heavy lifting.\n\nThough it fell a bit short of exceptional, Catching Fire is by no means a Sophomore Slump, and I look forward to watching Mockingjay Part 1 on the big screen when it comes out!",

      "name": "One of the best films of the 1990s.",
      "reviewBody": "In the aftermath of _Pulp Fiction_, much of the filmmaking of the 1990s thrived upon attempts to appear &quot;edgy&quot; within the constructs of independent films, or merely to provide empty shock value cliches. And no film ever came close to the sheer cleverness of Tarantino&apos;s masterpiece.\n\n_Trainspotting_, however, somehow manages to take the excesses of the mid-90s and rise far, far above the cinematic cliches that it easily could have become. A film that tackles any hot-button social issue can, and usually does, simply become a didactic propaganda piece. Thankfully, _Trainspotting_ is vastly more intelligent in its edginess and its shock.\n\nIn order to appreciate _Trainspotting_ fully, the viewer must abandon any preconceptions about what defines truly great cinema, because this film defies convention at nearly every turn. And with the rapid pace of its plot, that&apos;s quite a bit of ground to cover.\n\nThough a great deal of the picture&apos;s brilliance is derived from director Danny Boyle&apos;s consistent rejection of typical cinematic techniques, the most satisfying and _best_ aspect of _Trainspotting_ is that Boyle creates a film that is neither pro-drug or anti-drug. Instead, he maintains a rare objectivity throughout the film, depicting this fascinating array of complex, beautifully acted characters with an honesty that it seldom captured on film. And, given the life that each character lives, it&apos;s nearly incomprehensible that a director would refrain from influencing the viewer&apos;s impressions in any way, yet that&apos;s exactly what Boyle does.\n\nThe dialogue-- or at least what portions of the brogue-drenched dialogue American viewers will be able to comprehend-- is alternately hilarious, raw, and brutal. And Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, and Robert Carlyle bring a remarkable compassion and depth to their portrayals of characters that could have easily lapsed into cliche.\n\nDespite its sheer brilliance, _Trainspotting_ is not a film that&apos;s easy to watch. The viewer is bombarded with images that transcend visceral discomfort in their horror-- this movie contains two of the most graphic, horrifying scenes I&apos;ve ever encountered. But, amazingly, none of these elements is used merely for shock value. Though the viewer will be mortified by some of the things that happen onscreen-- the well-documented dive into Scotland&apos;s most vile public toilet, for example-- these scenes all make _perfect sense_ within the context of a masterfully told story.\n\nIn order to notice all of the subtlety that also exists in _Trainspotting_, repeat viewings are necessary, primarily to reduce some of the most powerful shocks ever-so-slightly, though their effects are never lost entirely. Some of the images will likely haunt even the most cynical, jaded viewer for weeks.\n\nRATING: 10 out of 10. Never patronizing and completely unpretentious, _Trainspotting_ is one of the most daring, unconventional films ever made. It inspires a level of discomfort rivaled by very few movies, because, even at its most graphic, Boyle never insults the viewer with mere shock tactics. Brilliantly acted, directed, and written, with a truly rare objectivity that allows each viewer to interpret its story on his/her own terms.",

I&apos;ve seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.\n\nAnd the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.\n\nPlus our the villains are so well done..\n\nBut I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.\n\nIt&apos;s been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool.",

Hillary Swank can never make another film and this one would be her crowning glory. It takes you on a wild ride of emotions from the beginning and Clint Eastwood&apos;s curmudgeon self is part of it all. Naturally, the &quot;voice of God&quot; in Morgan Freeman is there to explain it all and give some meaning to what each of the characters fell. By now, everyone knows the ending but I still won&apos;t spoil it for late-comers to the film like myself. I do believe much has been made about it and it&apos;s unnecessary. Yes, you will be torn about what is morally right but you can certainly understand how Eastwood&apos;s and Swank&apos;s characters feel! Please see this film. You will understand pugilism more than ever before and you just might see some of your own self in the film! It is well worth the time!",

      "reviewBody": "Beginning with a crime-thriller and a fantasy film on his directorial résumé, it is safe to say that Matthew Vaughn may have already found his niche genre in the super-hero field despite only directing four films in seven years. His first super-hero project, &apos;Kick Ass,&apos; opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film&apos;s ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with &apos;X-Men: First Class,&apos; an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It&apos;s intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.\n\nSet within the political context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960&apos;s, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is an up-and-coming Professor whose life is drastically altered when he is introduced to the other members of society who also share the same mutant gene as himself that supplies them with super-human abilities and traits. After stumbling upon the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) within his mansion, the telepathic Xavier then encounters Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), the son of Jewish parents who were murdered during the holocaust by the narcissistic former Nazi scientist, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik, who can manipulate all metal objects around himself, wants retribution and nothing more from Sebastian who is now a successful and evil underground figurehead who commands a team of mutants (Azazel, Emma Frost and Riptide) to do his bidding for him. But, once his plan for world domination is revealed, they find that it far exceeds the constraints of humanity, and Xavier, Erik and a rag-tag band of young, hide-away mutants (Havok, Beast, Darwin, Angel and Banshee) who were discovered by Charles, must combine their powers in one last attempt to stop Shaw from destroying the planet and humanity as a whole.\n\nInstantly where &apos;X-Men: First Class&apos; works is in regards to its two central characters; Charles Xavier played by an incredibly affluently sounding James McAvoy and a rage-fuelled Erik Lehnsherr played by a stern-faced Michael Fassbender. Their instant on-screen chemistry provides the drive and ammunition for the plot to carry itself forward. Both characters have differing ideologies and their constant clashes due to this aspect allow the script to be brought to life. Instead of simply infusing their relationship with formulaic violent clashes, Vaughn has instead opted for more articulated verbal battles between the two characters regarding their stance within the society they are now becoming a part of. Xavier is an intellectual being who believes that humans will eventually be accepted within society as equals alongside humans, while Lenhsherr believes that mutants will always be hunted and unable to live peacefully side-by-side with the human race, his evidence for this resides in the anti-Semitism and hatred he received at the hands of the Nazi party during the holocaust. This heavy-set contradiction in ideologies allows their relationship to be imbued with pessimism, while they may be shown as friends and fighting together initially, fans of the comic books and films in general know this does eventually turn into a bitter rivalry and it&apos;s this development which drives the plot forward.\n\nAside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960&apos;s X-Men universe. With a modest running time at two hours and ten minutes, there are more than a few well-choreographed action sequences that would adequately satisfy any of comic-book-to-film aficionado&apos;s wishing to see this film. Each character&apos;s power or ability is at some point represented in a destructive or defensive capacity, taking full advantage of the fact that while many super-hero movies tend to concentrate on the aesthetic nature of the artillery characters can be seen to withstand from governmental agencies or blindsided human opponents, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that human reaction would be futile due to the overwhelming power the mutants possess. These scenes also allow the less important characters to show their physical presence on-screen. For example, during the climactic fight sequence at the conclusion of the film, every mutant character that is identified to the audience is finally shown using their abilities to full capacity, most notably the henchmen of Shaw and the rag-tag team of Xavier and Lehnsherr. This therefore accounts slightly for the lack of depth that has been attempted in these secondary characters due to the time and story constraints.\n\nWhile it is a very good and accessible comic-book/super-hero movie, &apos;X-Men&apos; does also contain two central flaws. The first is superseded in a way by the strength of both McAvoy and Fassbenders performances, as Kevin Bacon is constantly overshadowed as the one-dimensional antagonist of the piece. His plot to ultimately destroy humanity becomes second fiddle to the ever intricate complex relationship between Xavier and Lehnsherr, and his appearance seems too modelled upon that of a James Bond villain. He has the slick hair, the beautiful women and the villainous underground Club to boot, but Bacon unfortunately doesn&apos;t have the charisma to be accepted as a worthy opponent to the protagonists. The other flaw has to do with a minor aspect of the production itself, as the non-diegetic music, most notably during the action sequences, begins to diminish in its impact as the film carries on, leading to it eventually becoming the generic, genre-related fanfare associated with the conventional comic-book films.\n\n&apos;X-Men: First Class,&apos; is not your typical comic-book movie, it may contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script at the film&apos;s core instead of the action-set-pieces taking place, Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a wide range of audience members.",

      "reviewBody": "At this time, there are already 530 reviews for &quot;Now You See It&quot;, so I&apos;ll try to be brief. The film is about a group of four magicians and mentalists who have been given a brilliant plan by an unseen genius. Again and again, the quartet perform seemingly impossible stunts and always seem many steps ahead of the police. And, in the process, they do HUGE magic tricks that are pretty much impossible. The presentation is VERY smooth and very slick and the overall production looks great. It has great music and effects. But, on the negative side none of this really makes a lot of sense and there is no way you can enjoy it if you think. This is especially true at the end (where there is a profession of love that comes from absolutely no where!!)--which is a gigantic cliché and made no sense whatsoever. The bottom line is that if you turn off you brain and enjoy it on a very superficial level, you&apos;ll enjoy it. If you try to make sense of it all, your head will explode. &apos;Nuff said.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Suicide Squad&apos; didn&apos;t sound so bad in hindsight. The concept was actually pretty interesting and there is a good deal of talent in the cast. Unfortunately what should have been a winner turned out to be a sore loser, even more of a wasted opportunity than &apos;Batman vs. Superman&apos;.\n\nThe costume and production design is both brooding and vibrantly colourful. There are two performances that are good. One is the enormously fun but also just as deliciously deranged Margot Robbie, her Harley Quinn being the film&apos;s most interesting character. The other is a menacing Viola Davis, proving that even a stony face makes one feel uneasy. El Diablo is also entertaining, and one of the few characters to be used right and feel necessary.\n\nHowever, for me Will Smith didn&apos;t work. You don&apos;t see him as Deadshot, you see him playing himself in wooden fashion here and plays Deadshot too jovially, something that Deadshot isn&apos;t really, that he also had two introductions gives an indication that the writers didn&apos;t know how to characterise the character. Enchantress is a pretty lame villain played with all cheese no menace by Cara Delevigne, while Jared Leto&apos;s Joker proves pointless and misplaced to the story (other than giving Harley Quinn backstory which wasn&apos;t fleshed out enough). Likewise with the Batman of Ben Affleck, while Killer Croc has nothing to do.\n\nOne of &apos;Suicide Squad&apos;s&apos; biggest failings is its treatment of the characters. Only Harley Quinn is fully fleshed out, while many characters are either given short shrift or either there was no use to them being there, for example what was the point of having Slipknot and then dispatch the character so quickly and cheaply. This is the consequences of having too many characters and a very muddled story that not only feels rushed but also incredibly confused. The script is equally a mess, with forced and very lazily-written jokes.\n\nVisually, other than the costume and set design, &apos;Suicide Squad&apos; doesn&apos;t have the redeeming value of looking good. Editing is choppy and the special effects range from average at best but mostly amateurish. The action scenes are very routine and less than thrilling, chemistry is extremely limited and suspense is next to zero. Plus the music is too constant and far too loud that it becomes a nauseating assault on the ears.\n\nIn conclusion, could have been a fun film but flounders badly due to lame execution that wastes its characters and much of the cast (with only Davis and particularly Robbie standing out). 3/10 Bethany Cox",

So I have it watch.\n\nHonestly, it was better than what I thought it was, but definitely one of the weaker Spider-Man movies. There are things that don&apos;t work in this movie - personally, Peter Parker as a skate kid didn&apos;t do it for me, a couple unsolved plots, and Uncle Ben (where was the famous line??) but there were good things too\n\nThe action and design of this movie was phenomenal. The swinging action is still the only movie that fully captures the agility of Spider-Man (the newer MCU ones don&apos;t really have these action shots) and the fight scenes are so cleverly made. Andrew Garfield got the Spider-Man half right - he captured the clever and witty personality of Spider-Man better than Maguire did. The second thing, really what stood out about this movie is the chemistry between Gwen and Parker. Something about their relationship connected and really made me think they were destined to be together. It&apos;s better than any other marvel ship that comes to my mind and thus just made the ending so satisfying for me.",

      "reviewBody": "Prepare yourself for a darker fantasy this time with some harrowing and scary special effects. Apparently J.K. Rowling has hit upon the fact that kids love to be scared stiff along with being entertained by touches of humor and excitement--although I think her imagination works overtime on scenes like the vomiting fit for Ron, one of the more tasteless sequences.\n\nAnd apparently the makers of this Potter film have met the challenge of providing spiders and snakes that are hideous enough to have Ron and the audience in a fit of hysterics. It&apos;s all here--the main events anyway of the Rowling book--and for extra measure they&apos;ve given a much needed humorous role to Kenneth Branagh who has great fun with his role as the self-loving Gilderoy Lockhart. The only real drawback is that Maggie Smith has very little to do--but the main chores belong to Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint who continue to charm as the three leads. Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy has a commanding presence and an amusingly wicked final scene involving the computer created Dobby who steals every scene he&apos;s in.\n\nShould keep Potter fans happy--and for a movie two-and-a-half hours long it moves along at a brisk pace from one adventure to another with what by now appears to be mechanical skill, thanks to artful direction by Chris Columbus who knows how to keep this sort of thing moving. John Williams&apos; perky score is a distinct help."

      "reviewBody": "I do not give out ratings of 10 lightly, but here it is - the first film in years that has been deserving of the rating.\n\nNeill Blomkamp brings to screens a fantastic, gritty, realistic piece of science fiction with District 9. Not since Ridley Scott&apos;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, John Carpenter&apos;s &quot;The Thing&quot;, or James Cameron&apos;s &quot;Aliens&quot; have we seen a science fiction film with a vision of this caliber. After viewing District 9, it will be clear to one and all why Peter Jackson put so much faith in Blomkamp and took him under his wing as protégé.\n\nAbandoning the usual settings of Hollywood sci-fi and placing us in the harsh slums of South Africa, we are given an original piece of work which takes risks in the way it tells its story. Not only does it go against the expectations of audiences who have been trained to expect mediocrity from their sci-fi, it goes above and beyond the call of duty to provide us with spectacle as well as something to ponder after we&apos;ve downed our popcorn.\n\nThere is, thankfully, not an overused, overexposed celebrity in sight, and every unknown face in the film gives a solid performance. The aliens themselves, brilliantly realized with top notch CGI even manage to make us feel something, only rivaled by Gollum from &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.\n\nDistrict 9 has so much to like. It&apos;s spectacular, darkly funny, entertaining and thoughtful all at the same time, and it&apos;s all done on a meager $30m budget. There is true talent on show here. If only there were more films like this, the world of cinema would be a more interesting place.",

One of the bigger issues with this movie is the pacing of the movie as I have said that the first half of this movie is very slow but eventually gets going and thats why really I really it up to and 8/10 for me. So I would definitely recommend it, and check it out immediately.",

In the end, Mia&apos;s fantasy surprised all the audience. This is the fantasy of all sweet love, and it is the most exciting meaning of this movie. I dare say that if there is no final fantasy, or the hero and heroine are together again, this movie will eventually become a second-rate love song and dance drama. Only if you can&apos;t get it, can you fully understand the bitterness and sweetness of youth. After all, the most beautiful love is just a flash in the pan.

      "reviewBody": "Few would dispute that &apos;Pan&apos;s Labyrinth&apos; is one of the best foreign language films of the 2000s, but I would go one step further and argue that it&apos;s also one of the best modern day fantasy/adventure films in general. There aren&apos;t many films that manage to blur the lines between fantasy and reality as effectively as &apos;Pan&apos;s Labyrinth&apos;. The effortless transition between the real world and the underworld and the way the two worlds are interlinked really is something special and I&apos;ve never seen it done as well before.\n\nThe combination of a convincing and easy to buy into storyline and the magical fantasy underworld works perfectly. The fact that both parts of the story could easily stand alone without the other, and yet go together seamlessly, is an indicator of just how good it is. The horror elements also bring something completely different and unexpected to the film, though they are tastefully added and never overdone. Overall, a wonderful film and one of the best fantasy/adventures of the 00s.",

      "name": "&quot;One of the best movies of 2008&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "F. Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s short story &apos;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&apos; has been transformed into a splendid film by David Fincher. A marvelously made film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one of the best movies of 2008. The cast is terrific and director David Fincher beautifully puts together the tale of Benjamin&apos;s life. The only large flaw many will find is that the concept of the film&apos;s premise seems too unrealistic.\n\nThe film tells the life of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). Born as an old man, Benjamin ages backwards; gradually getting younger as those around him age normally. Benjamin is abandoned at birth and picked up at an old-age home. As a child - or rather as a hunched over 80 year old - he meets a girl named Daisy (Cate Blanchett). Together they engage in innocent child games, and through this they develop a special connection. As Benjamin goes off into the world, Daisy continues to grow up, later pursuing her dream of dancing. Benjamin joins a crew and sails round the world, ending up in Russia. Then, after Pearl Harbor, Benjamin joins in the war effort, following battles across the north Pacific and only engaging in one combat situation.\n\nReturning to New Orleans, Benjamin has grown taller, lost many of his wrinkles, and grown more hair. The visual effects are spectacular in following Brad Pitt through the various stages of his life. From an old man to a young teen, Benjamin always resembles Pitt. Upon arrival in his childhood home, Benjamin learns that many of the tenants he knew have passed on. This is the tragedy of aging backwards, those you knew continue to age forward as they exit this world while you do the opposite. Benjamin also meets Daisy again, who after many years has become a successful dancer and has blossomed into a beautiful young woman. Long gone is the innocence of childhood, and Daisy has become intimate with many men in New York City. Missing by an inch, she and Benjamin do not initiate a relationship until later in the film.\n\nNarrated from the present, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button starts with Daisy&apos;s daughter reading Benjamin&apos;s diary to her mother in a hospital on the cusp of Hurricane Katrina. This allows the narration to occasionally halt for an elderly Daisy to comment on events of her life. A key motif running throughout this film is time. Beginning and ending with sequences about the same clock, David Fincher seems to allude to the notion that things fade, and that we must hold on to the things we love in the time we have with them.\n\nThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a fantastic film. Beautifully created, David Fincher paints an image of the south of the United States in the early 1900s which seems both realistic and fantastical. The film also illustrates war, travel, death, and many of the other events of life. Brad Pitt shows emotional depth as Benjamin, and Cate Blanchett is terrific as Daisy. It is surprising how much we can take away from a 166 minute movie, the audience feels as if they have known Benjamin and Daisy for all of their lives. While some may question the premise of the film, arguing that time is linear and that the plot is therefore incoherent, there can be no arguing that this film does its best to develop human relationships and to establish emotional connections between characters. As Roger Ebert once said, &quot;A film is not about its subject; it&apos;s about how it&apos;s about its subject&quot;, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button certainly handles its subject material splendidly.",

      "reviewBody": "To chase after an iconic masterpiece, to imitate or to try and supplant its rightful place, is a fool&apos;s errand.\n\nThankfully director Denis Villeneuve along with his talented collaborators never succumbs to imitating or trying to super-cede Ridley Scott&apos;s 1982 landmark &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. \n\nHampton Fancher, who created the story of the original, has crafted a new screenplay with Michael Green, that not only builds on the themes of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, but ties them together with larger questions about the current human state and its challenges.\n\nRyan Gosling stars as a replicant of the latest generation, who tries to solve a puzzle that leads him into the realm of real and manufactured life, and walks along the same noirish paths that made the original so gripping. Gosling imbues his character with a very compelling façade, which starts to crumble as his humanity takes over his mechanical design.\n\nThe equally thrilling performances by Jared Leto, Ana De Armas, Robin Wright, Carla Juri and of course Mr. Harrison Ford, forge a credible bond with the audience and enhance the visual grandeur created by cinematographer Roger Deakins and production designer Dennis Gassner.\n\nAnd although &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; may not achieve the same level of force as its predecessor, it is a tremendously immersive, philosophical and touching experience, that should be enjoyed on the largest screen possible. \n\nThe movie&apos;s pace is deliberately patient, which may confuse some members of the audience. But by slowing down and observing, the audience can revel in the immensity of the images.\n\nThe more we move, inexorably it seems, towards the do-or-die reality of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, the more vital these stories become.\n\nWhatever the box-office-fate of &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; will be, the long wait has paid off. It is far more than just a quick cash-in on a cult classic or an overly devoted sequel. It stands on its own and adds many new layers to the question: &quot;What makes us human?&quot; \n\nAnd it urges us on to find the truth in the rain.",

It&apos;s not going to be easy, as they must rescue Sparrow, convince all the pirate lords to join them and defeats Beckett, whilst each individual pirate has their own route which they wish to follow.\n\nIt&apos;s often a sad time for me, when i see a trilogy come to an end. There are so many great characters that you really do start to miss them. Unfortunately, trilogies always seem to have the problem are living up to the previous movies. &apos;At World&apos;s End&apos; falls into this category. The characters are great as always with Geoffrey Rush bringing Barbossa back to life as much as he did in the first movie. The special effects are amazing again, with some beautiful crafted fight sequences and Davy Jones looking even more realistic. The music is fun again but disappointing compared to the first two films. The main problem with this film is the story. It&apos;s not the most easy to follow story and can really make you think for a bit. Still, the third &apos;Pirates&apos; movie is a roller-coaster of a movie.\n\n&quot;Do you fear death?&quot; - Davy Jones (Bill Nighy)",

      "reviewBody": "Daniel Craig stars in this reboot to the Bond franchise. The prologue sets the darker and grittier mood right away. It&apos;s black and white, and it&apos;s hard violence. Just in case you didn&apos;t get the message. The story goes pretty quickly to Daniel Craig jumping on giant cranes, in a crazy parkour chase. This is not your daddy&apos;s Bond.\n\nThis Bond starts off as a brash guy who just got his double o designation. He&apos;s physical. The action is more visceral, not as much cartoon violence. Bond as a physical specimen is epitomized by the bikini shot. It&apos;s not a Bond girl that gets the big bikini reveal. It&apos;s Bond.\n\nThe story does have a slowdown after the crane to pick up all the pieces of the story. Once it gets going again, and this time he doesn&apos;t stop. But it&apos;s not simply more action that&apos;s the difference from Pierce Brosnan. It&apos;s the rejection of all that is Bond cheese. The smirky tone, and the perfunctory womanizing are all gone.\n\nMads Mikkelsen provides a good menacing foil. And Eva Green provides the proper love interest. However she comes in an hour into the movie and would be better to have more screen time. At least, she and Bond have good verbal exchanges with the time they have, and the movie really takes off. Bond is monogamous. Who knew?",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s true that you can have too much of a good thing...please no more different editions!\n\nTHEATRICAL CUT - was the best version of any of the &quot;cuts&quot; it was the most cleanly edited and it had the best soundtrack out of the three. It is clear after seeing all the versions of the film that they tested all of the jokes and the ones included were cherry picked, and the best were picked to be included in this one.\n\nSUPER DUPER CUT/EXTENDED - this was supposed to be an extended version of the film but it was actually a different cut...what I mean by that is that they changed the soundtrack and they cut out what I considered to be some of the funniest jokes from the theatrical cut and replaced them. They ALSO added some additional footage to the film after making those changes. This version of the film feels darker and less funny to me personally so I prefer the theatrical cut over it.\n\nONCE UPON A DEADPOOL/PG13 - This is the edition that nobody asked for and is the most unnecessary. From an editing standpoint this version of film is very sloppy, and seems like one giant montage. They don&apos;t even start this version of the film out at the beginning it jumps right into the &quot;safe room scene&quot;. A lot of the footage included in this edition was already available on the home releases and online (apart from the short amount filmed with Fred Savage). The movie would end up edited on TV regardless of this edition existing or not. So in reality there was no need for this edition to exist apart from making more money.",

It was very moving to see Adrian Leduc being George VI. What an astonishing actor. In Apartment Zero he creates a character without a personality. A repressed, innocent that comes out as a total weirdo but we know better. His undeclared needs reflected in Colin Firth&apos;s eyes are a prodigious acting feast. In The King&apos;s Speech, his George VI suffers from a different fear but it&apos;s also pungently clear in the actor&apos;s eyes. I think what they both share is a desperate wish to be invisible. For King George that&apos;s an impossibility so, his struggle to move forward, learning to be the man everyone expects him to be is enormously moving. As you may have guessed, Colin Firth has become one of my favorite actors of all time.",

      "reviewBody": "As a young boy, dinosaurs were the greatest thing on earth (well, the greatest thing that once WAS on earth) for me. I knew most of their names (like Gray in JW) and had my plastic dinosaurs fighting themselves, evil, and sometimes also good. You can imagine my excitement when I first saw Jurassic Park and I was truly blown away by the idea. I still somehow wish that I could actually experience the events in the movie, although I understand the critic that the author of the novel, Michael Crichton, wanted to express. Much of that critic is lost in the third sequel to the original movie, 22 years after its original release, at least it&apos;s hidden very deep in the plot. The scientists have created a new super- species, filled the missing pieces of DNA up with genes of amphibians that all have certain survival-powers, and it all goes terribly wrong, much because the dinosaurs are being underestimated as they always were. So is it a reboot of the first movie? At least a bit. They are referring to the first movie all the time, examples: A control guy wearing an Jurassic Park shirt proudly says he got an original shirt (shown in part 1 several times) for $150 from eBay, they run through degenerated original buildings and one time the kids even drive an original van that they repaired competently. New park-owner Masrani says that John Hammond told him on his death bed to &quot;spare no expense&quot;, which was one of the funniest scenes in the movie, yet Masrani doesn&apos;t want to commercialize the park too much. That&apos;s where the movie starts being perfectly self-ironic: one control guy (the one with the classic shirt) jokingly suggests, in order to please the investors, to name newly bred species after companies, &quot;so how about Pepsi-Saurus&quot;? The movie indeed is full of product placements, I counted at least 9 brands and logos that are shown or mentioned during the film. So what is the purpose of the movie? Mainly, I guess, it&apos;s meant as a nostalgic, yet up-to-date experience/excuse for all those fans who were bitterly disappointed by the Parts II&amp;III. It&apos;s exciting, contains a little love story, it&apos;s got wit, social criticism and excellently animated dinosaurs. It shows that 22 years after Jurassic Park, movie heroes are still being chauvinist and women are still stronger and braver as they are pictured in most (other) movies. And, finally, it fulfills every fans biggest desire: man and dinosaur, at last fighting side by side. That&apos;s probably why I&apos;d give it an even better rating than the original Jurassic Park movie, although of course classic scenes like the shaking water glass will probably never be outperformed. Résumé: Director Colin Trevorrow manages to create an enthralling and visually stunning homage to the original which at some points brilliantly steps out of the shadow of its role model and finally puts the conciliatory end to the dinosaur universe that we, the fans, truly deserved.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Her&quot; is a film set in the very, very near future. Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) is a very lonely and emotionally constricted man. He&apos;s getting a divorce and seems very isolated--even though he lives in a huge city. One day, he decides to upgrade to a new hyper-intelligent operating system--one that claims to have a real personality. Well, it turns out to be so and then some. In fact, the computer OS, Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), is like a person in so many ways that soon it becomes all- important to Theodore and eventually it&apos;s his girlfriend. Where all this goes is a very slow journey, but it&apos;s also quite beautiful.\n\nThis film, while sci-fi, doesn&apos;t seem outside the realm of possibility. In this often disconnected and cold world, such a relationship seems like a safe alternative. Healthy, of course not--but very safe for a scarred person who wants intimacy but who is afraid to seek it. I thought the film had a really interesting message about this and is well worth seeing. My only reservation is that the film is VERY adult--with phone sex and a bit of nudity you probably wouldn&apos;t want your kids to see. Plus, at times the film feels a bit creepy. Good...but a bit sad and creepy. Well worth your time and an interesting performance by Phoenix and a really amazing film by Spike Jonze.",

Praised for its cinematography, Morricone's score, and Tarantino's dark humor and violence, it explores themes of race, revenge, and post-Civil War America. However, some find it overly long, slow-paced, and heavy-handed with dialogue and violence. Its structure and mystery elements are unique, yet opinions on its impact vary, making it a significant yet divisive addition to Tarantino's work.",

And Michael Bay does an excellent job at delivering high energy action sequences that are visually stunning. The writing is exceptionally poor and the film goes on for far too long, but the action and the visual effects keep the audience engaged. Transformers is messy and cheesy, and sophomoric...but it&apos;s also a lot of fun and immensely entertaining.",

      "reviewBody": "I love the Star Wars franchise. I was so anxious to watch The Last Jedi especially how The Force Awakens ended and how good The Force Awakens was. I bought my tickets a month and a half in advance in anticipation of episode eight. \n\nAs the movie started I was dialed in for the first 15 minutes then I noticed this subtle uneasiness in me like a disturbance in the force. It began with the interaction between Poe and Princess Leia. She made a comment and made a decision regarding Poe that I found a little unsettling. &quot;OK.&quot; I thought. I didn&apos;t like that exchange but it&apos;s not a show stopper. The subtlety was that Leia was making it seem like the Rebels were in no need of heroes. They didn&apos;t need fighters anymore, they needed thinkers (or something akin to that). I took that little shift in philosophy in stride and kept eagerly watching. A couple of other small iniquities occurred but I soldiered forth watching with an open mind because it&apos;s &quot;Star Wars&quot;.\n\nThen, there came the interaction between Rey and Luke Skywalker.\n\nLuke is part of movie folklore to me. Like many people have the one celebrity they&apos;d like to meet: the one fictional character for me has always been Luke Skywalker. Luke was the first hero I&apos;d seen wear black. He had piloting skills, light saber skills and could do Jedi mind tricks. He was the coolest.\n\nFast forward nearly 40 years and now Luke is an old man. So what I&apos;m expecting is an older, WISER Luke. If Luke is on a deserted planet then it must be for a very good reason. And if Rey found him, much like Luke found Yoda, then Luke will have so much to impart upon Rey. That&apos;s not quite what went down. They made Luke a sullen pessimistic old man that was ignorant of simple truths. He offered so little; to the movie and to Rey. He was a shell of his former self, he was only good at being the ex machina. The Luke Skywalker in this movie was NOT the Luke Skywalker I knew. The Luke Skywalker I know was killed in this movie.\n\nAfter seeing my fictional hero relegated to something unrecognizable I actually became bitter while watching the movie. There was almost nothing they could do to save the movie. And they didn&apos;t . In fact, it got worse. By the end the movie was more of what I should have saw coming: rebels running from the Republic and figuring out some remote yet heroic way to ward them off. And what added to the annoyingness of this movie is that they didn&apos;t know when or how to end it. What should have been the end was followed up by another half an hour mini movie with its own beginning, middle and end.\n\nBut unlike The Last Jedi I know how to end this post. Don&apos;t waste your time.",

      "reviewBody": "Walt Disney is one of, if not, the most popular animation studio of all time.\n\nEveryone has watched at least one Disney movie in their life, and today&apos;s review is going to be about their highest grossing animated movie of all time (outside of it&apos;s sequel and the remake of Lion king).\n\nThe story is loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen&apos;s Snow queen and is set in the Kingdom of Arendelle. There were 2 young princesses - Anna and Elsa, the latter one had snowy magical powers who sadly led the former&apos;s life to no good, thus separating the two when they were kids. Years passed, and Elsa has her coronation ceremony, and Anna meets her love at first sight - Prince Hans. When Anna asks her older sister to engage them, she says that you can&apos;t marry a man that you just met (and she was right actually). Sadly the princess and the queen argue and Elsa freezes her kingdom on accident. As a result, Anna has to go to the north mountain to return her sister back. On her way, she meets Kristoff, a man who works on the lake to sell ice, his reindeer pet Sven who adores carrots and a lovely snowman Olaf who loves warm hugs.\n\nLike most Disney movies, this is a musical and has 10 songs in total. Of course we can&apos;t talk about this movie without mentioning Let it go performed by Idina Menzel and Demi Lovato. It&apos;s a song about escaping from the sad past and being free! This song won an Oscar for best original song and I can see why. My favorite song other then let it go has to be for the first time in forever performed by Kristen bell. It&apos;s a very happy one where Anna is so excited for the coronation because finally the gates have open. The sad thing is that unlike let it go, it doesn&apos;t have it&apos;s pop music counterpart, which could be performed by either Selena Gomez or Miley Cyrus or even Taylor swift (Because the first 2 were working on Disney channel with Demi back in late 2000s). Other songs include In summer, Love is an open door, Reindeers are better than people, fixer upper and do you want to build a snowman are also great, each in their own way. The only exception is the first song, it&apos;s not terrible and it&apos;s actually ok as it&apos;s own song, but comparing it to others, it&apos;s easily the weakest in my opinion (the one where Kristoff is a kid doing the ice work and men singing about cold winter) As for the characters, each one is important. With the two sisters, Elsa is the one who didn&apos;t have the best childhood, as she had to keep her powers under control otherwise she may hurt someone. As for Anna, she&apos;s the complete opposite of her sister because she&apos;s very optimistic and naive in the contrast of Elsa&apos;s seriousness and anxiety. Anna believes in love and that she can fix anything, she&apos;s also a little bit stubborn, because listening to others isn&apos;t exactly her thing, thus preferring to do things her own way. Kinda reminds me of Rapunzel from Tangled. Olaf is easily the cutest Disney sidekick ever created. He&apos;s a little snowman who dreams about summer and adores warm hugs. Kristoff is one of Anna&apos;s friends she meets and he&apos;s a little bit pessimistic, but still helpful on her journey. Also Hans is the guest from the southern islands who really likes Anna and tries to take care of the town while she&apos;s gone. But I won&apos;t tell you what happens to him afterwards, because if I do, it may ruin a surprise for you. There are also secondary characters including Duke of Weaseltown (or Wesseltown), Oaken the salesman, the rock trolls and a giant snowman named Marshmallow. Not as memorable as the main ones, but still very important.\n\nLast things last, let&apos;s talk about it&apos;s animation. It&apos;s absolutely beautiful. There&apos;s lot&apos;s of details in every chunk of ice, in every piece of clothing and even a strand of hair. The backgrounds are gorgeous to look at, especially during winter scenes! The designs are great too. It stays true to both Disney and Norwegian styles, which makes this film stand out from the rest. The ice castle that Elsa created is probably the best element of the animation, it took somewhere from 5 to 9 months to animate 15 seconds of it&apos;s building, which is astounding in my opinion.\n\nThe best thing I can say about it is that this is Disney&apos;s greatest film since the lion king and truly deserves the title of the best animated feature of 2013. I recommend it to everyone who hasn&apos;t seen this masterpiece, especially Disney fans and young girls. But I think even people outside the demographic will appreciate it too. A must see movie!\n\nThe cold never bothered me anyway!",

      "reviewBody": "As you can tell from the first review, you probably have to be a big reader or fanboy/girl of Sherlock Holmes in order to be displeased. I was pleased almost the whole way through this movie without caring much about character. Still, even though Sherlock Holmes sometimes was a bit too &apos;ambiguously gay&apos; and had an annoying modern-like personality, he continued to be funny, strange, and as intelligent as I thought Sherlock should be. Jude Law did a good job as well as others on the cast.\n\nI loved the plot. It was obvious to me at times how the story would unravel, but then it hits you again in the end. It was a subtle hit, however. Anyways, my favorite part of the story was mainly the broad scheme of things and the people involved. Sherlock goes deep enough into the world of conspiracy to keep me interested.\n\nMy only gripe with this movie is sometimes the humor. A lot of the &apos;humor&apos; came out during conversations. People would laugh at the wittiness spewed by the main characters, and it just felt too much like a modern sitcom. Today, American society and culture is infected with internet memes, battles of quick wit, and straight-faced jokes that provoke a lame laughter from me (one not deeply felt.) You could compare what I am saying to the dialogue in &apos;The Big Bang Theory.&apos; Hollywood could maybe tone down a bit on dry and clever jokes, especially when they poke out during unnecessary times.\n\nIn conclusion, I enjoyed this movie enough to rate it an 8 out of 10, and although I did complain more than I gave praise, I just didn&apos;t want to give away all of the good parts. Go see this movie. It&apos;s fresh, isn&apos;t based in America, and doesn&apos;t trail off there either. There are twists, excellent action scenes, lots of fun moments, sweet investigation, and some analogous material better discussed in a forum of theorists.",

I was VERY surprised at how different it was than I expected it to be - I expected a ton of violence and not much in the way of writing or acting. The first time I saw it, I wasn&apos;t blown away, just kind of like whatever.\n\nWhen I watched it for the second time, however, I really started to notice how well it&apos;s made, in addition to liking it more. Every shot is bursting with background detail, a great amount of attention on the production design (the theme of a certain color in a scene was restrained, yet perfectly balanced). The actors really gave it all, especially the 2 male leads who really blew me away. The music is a varied mix of beautiful classical music and some pretty cool techno. The screenplay is brilliant; the characters are developed very well, extremely complex, and the plot is not only ingenious, but the payoff and twists are 1000x better than any Shamaylan movie.\n\nSimply put, from a technical point of view, it&apos;s one of the best movies ever. From a critic&apos;s point of view, it is a very well-done movie that goes a little overboard in sex and violence, and is just a little strange.",

The hype and popularity that built up towards the film&apos;s release had me expecting something fresh, something that would keep me laughing days after. To my disappointment, &apos;Ted&apos;, to me, turned out to just another Rom-Com, its only real unique twist being Ted himself. \n\nHaving said that, &apos;Ted&apos; did provide some good laughs, whilst they weren&apos;t exactly side-splitting the film was entertaining and I did watch the entire feature without getting bored or uninterested. The animations for Ted were of a good quality, doing a good job in making it seem like Ted was actually there with the actors, rather than just a computer-generated 3D image. \n\nWhat I felt let &apos;Ted&apos; down was it&apos;s predictability and lack of memorable or unique laughs. Being rated as a 15, &apos;Ted&apos;s plot didn&apos;t seem to suit it&apos;s targeted audience, I have seen similar story lines in films rated PG or even U but the explicit content of &apos;Ted&apos; was clearly intended for more mature audiences, therefore I felt it deserved a more mature plot. \n\nOverall, I&apos;d recommend &apos;Ted&apos; to those who are looking for a relatively light-hearted story with a few giggles added in and a cursing, yet somehow still lovable, teddy bear. It&apos;s good, but nothing overly special.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie narrates an incredible story using the most beautiful special effects and great actors.\n\nIt is more that a survival story and it is not about friendship. This story is about faith. Director Ang Lee use all the tools he have to make this movie about a solitary young man not a boring one. It is narrated by both, young Pi and the Adult Pi, it uses music all the time so there is not space for uncomfortable silents and the rhythm of the scenes is fast. The result a very entertained film.\n\nThe most important thing of this film is it character. It is obvious because we are seeing for almost 2 hours just one character. So it is not only important to have a great character that appeals to the audience feelings, but to have an actor that portray this person the right way. Suraj Sharma was brilliant as Pi. He can make happy scenes as equal as sad, desperate, hopelessness, exhaustion and anger ones. Very few movies allow an actor represent so many emotions.\n\nBut if Pi is a good character, Richard Parker can only be describe as unique. The tiger as personality of it&apos;s own. Not many films can make an animal with so many human features and yet never stop being a wild animal. This tiger is computed animated but the audience will barely notice, because the way it walks, eats, its factions, the eyes. It doesn&apos;t matter if it is computer animation, Richard Parker is alive and is his own character just as important as Pi is.\n\nIf you think that &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot; have good animal effects, you have to see how this people make a zebra, a hyena and a orangutan. All this, combine with a photography created by the same guy that make &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot; looks so cool and &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot; so beautiful, Claudio Miranda, makes it an incredible experience to see.\n\nThis movie is definitely an Oscar runner for Special Effects, Cinematography, Director and Movie of the year.",

      "reviewBody": "Whilst viewing &apos;Birdman&apos;, I spent the first hour of the film trying to decipher my emotions and opinions towards it, what I was watching was a weird, yet wonderful work of art. Truly though, &apos;Birdman&apos; is a technical masterpiece. Michael Keaton has generally been undermined as an actor (despite a few notable roles as Batman or Beetlejuice) and has instead faced Hollywood picking more acclaimed and popular actors, &apos;Birdman&apos; however might just be his ticket to an Oscar nomination, and possibly even a win, his performance is mesmerising. Alejandro González Iñárritu has created a truly spectacular character study that arguably features this year&apos;s strongest acting performances, alongside a well- executed script, booming soundtrack and a monumental achievement with cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki in which he attempts a Hitchcockian approach, reminiscent of &apos;Rope&apos;, and displays the story through a seemingly single and unbroken sweeping shot. This is the true definition of a masterpiece."

      "reviewBody": "Archeologists and lovers Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered several pictographic records from across the Earth&apos;s civilizations dating back 35,000 years detailing worship by ancient peoples of giant humanoid beings with shared star maps. Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) the late billionaire founder and CEO of Weyland Corp. Finances an expedition on board the ship Prometheus to LV-223 detailed in the ancient star maps under the direction of Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), Synthetic humanoid David (Michael Fassbender), and a team of scientists to locate the ancient alien species known as &quot;The Engineers&quot;. Upon arrival, the crew find remnants of the Engineers which may prove to be more dangerous than any of them imagined.\n\nPrometheus&apos; origins date back almost 10 years prior to its final release where James Cameron and Ridley Scott had jointly pitched a fifth Alien movie following Sigourney Weaver&apos;s hesitance to return as Ripley that would serve as a prequel to the series and examine the origins of the spaceship and the &quot;space jockey&quot; that had long captured the fandom. These plans were put on hold when Fox decided to prioritize the crossover Alien vs. Predator which both Cameron and Scott aw as undermining the validity of the series putting the proposed prequel on a shelf. Following the negative reception of Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, Fox began salvage attempts for each franchise with Robert Rodriguez making the film Predators and Scott given development resources for the Alien prequel. There was a conscious effort on Scott&apos;s part to make the film its own story relatively independent of Alien with more focus paid to building the mythology around the Space Jockey rather than the Xenomorphs themselves. The film was undoubtedly one of the most anticipated films of the 2012 Summer movie season with the direction by Scott and a promised R-Rating seeing as a welcome return to form for both the Alien series as well as a welcome return by Scott to the Sci-fi genre after not having directed such a film since Blade Runner in 1982. While the movie received solid enough reviews upon release, a good number of critics had expressed disappointment with the handling of certain elements of the material with the screenplay by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof garnering a lot of criticism for its feeling of raising more questions than answers. When I first saw Prometheus 10 years ago I think I tried to tell myself that I liked it because there are moments of wonder and majesty in the film that are sights to behold, but I also felt this feeling of &quot;something wasn&apos;t quite right&quot; that&apos;s only gotten more pronounced with time.\n\nTo start on a positive note, Prometheus starts out of the gate feeling like a true epic. From Marc Streitenfeld&apos;s sweeping score to Dariusz Wolski&apos;s awe inspiring cinematography Prometheus is a film whose sheer enormity in both scale and tone leaves the viewer with a strong sense of grandiosity that serves to make them feel dwarfed by comparison. The movie also features a fantastic performance by Michael Fassbender as David the synthetic humanoid and the opening stretch where he goes around the Prometheus by himself tending to all the ship&apos;s functions while keeping himself occupied is one of the best character moments in the film and he becomes something of a core to this movie that holds it together even during its weaker moments.\n\nUnfortunately the movie makes a number of missteps in other areas, particularly in its characterizations and story beats. The movie features way too many characters for the kind of movie it is with 17 crewmembers in total on board the Prometheus and many of them just being glorified &quot;red shirts&quot; to pad out the body count. What characterization we are given isn&apos;t particularly compelling with Sean Harris and Rafe Spall playing a geologist and biologist who not only carry an out of place pessimism that feels ill fitting for this story, but end up doing some really boneheaded decisions that don&apos;t make sense in context of what the movie presents us. There&apos;s a large number of moments in this film where characters make terrible decisions that don&apos;t make sense from trying to pet clearly dangerous wildlife, getting obvious infections and then telling no one about it, or justifying decisions with tired adages like &quot;because it&apos;s what I choose to believe&quot; that parts of the movie veer off into unintentional comedy with how nonsensical characters act. We also have Guy Pearce in some really unconvincing &quot;old man&quot; make-up as Peter Weyland that was apparently only done because the script called for scenes in the past with Weyland as a young man, but those scenes were dropped during re-writes so we&apos;re just supposed to accept this on face value. The movie tries to build its own mythology with the Engineers from the space jockey established in the first Alien film and given Scott&apos;s professed distain for the AVP series it&apos;s rather ironic that he went with the &quot;ancient astronauts visiting Earth&quot; stuff that was featured prominently in those films as a backbone for Prometheus (not a spoiler by the way, all this is seen in the first 3 minutes).\n\nIf you&apos;re a fan of Alien then you&apos;ll probably find a lot of value in Prometheus with its production design, grand scope, and performance by Michael Fassbender solid points to appreciate, but the dangling plot threads begging for sequels, characters lacking in brain cells, and some really stupid justifications for faith that feel like flowery nonsense. I know this movie has an audience that likes it, but I unfortunately can&apos;t count myself among that audience despite my best attempts.",

However, the film faces criticism for outdated special effects, underdeveloped characters, and a perceived shallow plot. Pacing issues and certain character choices are also noted. Despite these drawbacks, 'X-Men' is recognized for revitalizing the comic book genre and establishing a standard for subsequent adaptations.",

      "reviewBody": "Within the first 5 minutes you can tell the series has undergone a dramatic tone shift and I have to say I think thats appropriate since Voldemorts return at the end of Goblet of Fire means that it&apos;s time to put aside childish things. The big bad men are here and they don&apos;t care about hurting children. it&apos;s time to get nasty.\n\nGone is the frivolity of the first couple of movies where magic was cool and everything in this new and magical world was just wonderful to behold, a la World of Disney. The new director has taken some risks with style and approach and they&apos;ve paid off brilliantly. Order of the Phoenix is probably the darkest of the five movies we&apos;ve had so far, even more so than Azkhaban which was a step in the right direction for where the series would eventually be heading. There&apos;s very little &quot;fun&quot; in Phoenix and you can see why. The Dark Lord is back, it&apos;s no laughing matter and this movie actually sells that fact.\n\nThis (in the movie world at least) is where Harry Potter crosses the line from kids movie to grown ups movie.\n\nHarry now has some serious mental scars (as well as his actual one of course) since the events of the previous movie which while lighter than Azkhaban, followed on well from that movie. The Ministry of Magic is in denial about Voldermorts return and are trying to control the flow of rumour stemming from the events of Goblet. To this end we have new teacher and Ministry stooge Dolores Umbridge. Pink and fluffy on the outside, crunchy and evil on the inside. She makes no qualms about re-ordering the law at Hogwarts putting the kybosh on anything even remotely fun and making the students lives a complete misery. What she put Harry through in detention was simply pure evil.\n\nShe wasn&apos;t quite how I pictured her from the book but Imelda Staunton played her with a deliciously bitter/sweet twist, all charming and proper in her righteous delusions with that &quot;stab you in the back&quot; thing going on. She was a nasty piece of work.\n\nIt is a shame that a lot of the content of the book was missing but it was a big book and although I can&apos;t put my finger on what wasn&apos;t in the movie (I read it a while ago now) it does sometimes feel that there should have more substance to a few areas, mainly the characterisation of some of the characters. Most of the major bits I remember from the book were in the movie. There&apos;s a pace here we haven&apos;t seen before, a new musical approach also puts a new twist on things and I think Harry Potters world seems to fit it&apos;s new clothes well. I&apos;m eagerly anticipating what&apos;s next as I hear David Yates is also directing the Half Blood Prince (last I heard anyway) and since that book has zombies in it I think the new dark style will suit it awesomely thank you very much.\n\nThe characters all look much older than they&apos;re supposed to be in Phoenix but it also kind of works in it&apos;s favour. They all look like they have a bit more history and life experience behind them, they&apos;re coping with stuff that will age any kid and it shows. That&apos;s also testament to the acting as well. Here mostly all the acting is pretty good, Ron Harry and Hermione all put in good efforts obviously having gotten the hang of the whole acting lark. Gambon is good as Dumbledore but I do miss Richard Harris and keep playing what might have been his versions of Gambons scenes over in my head. When I read the books it&apos;s Harris I&apos;m picturing. Helena Bonham Carter gives a kooky insane kind of air to Bellatrix Lestrange (must get that from hubby Tim Burton) who was a pretty good character. One thing about this film though is that the actual Order of the Phoenix isn&apos;t in it all that much really. A flaw that wasn&apos;t in the book. The line about Snape being in the order, if you missed it you wouldn&apos;t even know he was in the order at all and a subsequent scene later on might seem confusing.\n\nKreacher was well done I though, coming across as a real miserable old bugger which was appropriate. The producers apparently weren&apos;t going to put him in the movie at all but JK Rowling said they&apos;d be stuffing themselves up for the final movie if they did that.\n\nAll in all I think Phoenix is the best so far of the five movies, followed by Azkhaban, Goblet, then the other two in no particular order.\n\nNow I&apos;ve just got hold of The Deathly Hallows and although it&apos;s quarter past five I&apos;m off to bed so see you later....",

      "reviewBody": "The Good:\n\nIn the spirit of a horny teenage boy awkwardly confessing his love to his crush of forever, I&apos;m just going to list everything I love about this comedy classic.\n\nThe ambiguous time period. Superbad looks, sounds, and feels like the 1970s (hence the title), with warm browns and oranges, a grainy &quot;shot-on-film&quot; feel, and a killer funk inspired soundtrack. Yet, it&apos;s clearly a movie set in the 2000s, with the cellphones, and the PS2s and the cars in the background. It&apos;s almost as if the movie is sub-communicating how timeless it would eventually become. Which, whether intentional or not, is telling as to how brilliant this raunchy, vulgar comedy truly is.\n\nJonah Hill and Michael Cera&apos;s chemistry in this film is UNREAL. They sound, act, and feel like actual friends and the reality that they&apos;ve never done another movie together sort of propels their dynamic in this film to LEGENDARY status. There&apos;s nothing to compare them to really; they are one of cinema&apos;s all time duos in this one, perfectly balancing off one another.\n\nIt calls back to another amazing aspect of this film; how realistic the teenagers look and act in this film. Clearly everyone is in their mid 20s, but most of the teens look like seniors on the cusp of graduation. More than that, they ACT realistically. One thing American high school films always get wrong is the &quot;clique.&quot; They&apos;re really not as rigid as films and TV portray; people frequently talk to, hang out with, and befriend people outside of their clique on a regular basis. Superbad nails how high school isn&apos;t a straightforward tribal hierarchy. It&apos;s a web of relationships.\n\nI know that sounds like a weird thing to praise this movie for, but it all culminates in one of the best party montages I&apos;ve seen put to film. It&apos;s super satisfying not just to see our heroes finally get to the Promised Land, but for it to be a party filled with generally realistic people. It harkens back to parties I went to back in the day; maybe that&apos;s why this movie speaks to me so much.\n\nSpeaking of realism, this film managed to impact pop culture going forward with the inclusion of the iconic Christopher Mintz-Plasse as McLovin. It&apos;s kind of appropriate he came and went; I&apos;d be surprised if he could ever top this role, to be honest. A testament to exceptional casting throughout this film, there&apos;s no one else I could imagine possibly being McLovin than this dude.\n\nWhat else can I say? The writing is basically perfect, with so many jokes crammed into this that you can watch it dozens of times and still find new things to laugh at. The performances are top notch from absolutely everyone, whether they&apos;re minor characters or romantic interests. The movie&apos;s real message about friendship and growing up is unbelievably heart warming.\n\nAND THAT ENDING. Would anyone have expected a movie about two horny teenage boys trying to deliver alcohol to a party for the express purposes of getting laid to end like this? For it to tug at your heart strings and wish there was another movie right after? I don&apos;t think so.\n\nBad: It&apos;s Super.\n\nThe Ugly: I&apos;m going to say it. Superbad is probably the last great American comedy film. There have been good comedies since, for sure, but do any of them even come close to Superbad? It&apos;ll be 15 years in 2022 since this movie came out, and honestly, it hasn&apos;t been topped. All hail the baddest of them all.",

Right from the start, I knew this was going to be a classic film, and my opinion was not changed throughout the course of the movie one bit. It delivers such a strong message of fear, survival and hope, that leaves your mind devoted to thinking about it for a long while after. It made me think about all my creature comforts, and what is actually necessary in life. Talking to a volleyball has never been more dramatic! I also loved the fact that there was little talking in the film, maybe that was because i was staying in a hotel in France with french TV, but anyway, it sort of made you guess how he was feeling, in a clever way. This is one of my all time favourite films, and I could watch it again and again without getting bored... so go and watch it...NOW!!",

      "reviewBody": "Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he&apos;s just done. Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency&apos;s response to what&apos;s just happened on screen. An American flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but as he speaks, it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory, as if it doesn&apos;t want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security.\n\nThis shot effectively captures the mood of the film. As well as portraying Bourne&apos;s quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security.\n\nIt is also probably the best film you&apos;ll see in the cinema this year. \n\nIt&apos;s just so intense. Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) &quot;This isn&apos;t some newspaper story, this is real&quot; and in the audience you almost believe him. The camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you&apos;re there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they&apos;re portraying, instead of just being actors performing well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing.\n\nThe pacing is just incredible. It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece. While they&apos;re often simple (the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they&apos;re charged with such dramatic intensity that you can&apos;t take your eyes off them. The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can&apos;t help being swept along by it.\n\nWith its intense action set-pieces, brilliantly paced storyline, and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age. Ultimatum is its peak.",

Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya's performances are highly commended. However, criticisms include pacing issues, rushed climaxes, and deviations from the source material.

So you can know that upfront, Pixar is going to fully deal with the subject of death that it touched upon I UP and hinted at in the death of childhood innocence in Inside Out.\n\nWe were subtly forewarned that tissues would be needed. :)\n\nIt surpasses the other aforementioned masterpieces by being more relatable, drawing on family restrictions and prohibitions (e.g. &quot;there will be no X in this family!&quot; X being &quot;instead whatever has caused pain to a family member in the past&quot;. Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we&apos;re at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?\n\nDid I mention bring Kleenex? A full box.

However, he is mistakenly sent to 1990 and locked up in a mental institution, where he meets the lunatic Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt). James Cole unsuccessfully tries to explain his assignment to the doctors, including the psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) that is responsible for his treatment, and then he tries to escape but is incarcerated in a cell. Out of the blue, he vanishes, in the beginning of the incredible journey of James Cole.\n\n&quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot; (1995) is a sci-fi ahead of the time. The plot has many details that requires the viewer to watch this film more than once to fully understand the story. Watching &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot; again in 2021 is particularly scary in times of the pandemic Covid. Hope that the history does not follow fiction.

You immediately fall in love with the characters and you want to follow every step of their doomed love story. it is one of the greatest love stories ever told.

The likable and endearing losers group make the film worth watching again long after the fright has worn off. It manages to go from terrifying to hilarious, with Richie smashing it as the comedian of the group. It also touches on deeper themes of the bonds of friendship, the traumas that take our innocence away and the courage we need to face our fears. You won&apos;t only be scared, you&apos;ll be moved and inspired. Though your opinions on clowns might take a hit."

What soon becomes clear is that it&apos;s not the money which will give Danny the ultimate satisfaction, but the opportunity to get revenge on the owner of the three casinos he is robbing -Benedict (Andy Garcia) who just happens to be the new beau of Danny&apos;s ex, Tess (Julia Roberts).\n\nSome of the gang of eleven are more memorable than others -especially the Chinese acrobat, the explosives expert with a dodgy cockney accent and the medallion wearing Reuben -aka Monica Gellar&apos;s dad!  The cast are brilliant at acting cool -even if all Brad Pitt is doing is snacking on the screen (he does this a lot!), you are still transfixed by him because he looks so good on screen.\n\nWhat makes the story so intriguing is the fact that Danny&apos;s mission seems so impossible: security in the casinos is paramount and the route to the reward is littered with obstacles.  The number of close calls that the gang is faced with is great fun and one can&apos;t help but root for these crooks throughout the film.  It is also refreshing to watch a film which is dominated by male stars and is not filled with macho swearing.  Instead, we have a banter between the stars which is indicative of their camaraderie.\n\n&apos;Ocean&apos;s Eleven&apos; is a welcome option in the choice of movies available at the moment which is dominated by Oscar nominees that are not going to be everyone&apos;s cup of tea.  With this film, it&apos;s simply a case of sit back and enjoy the fun!",

      "reviewBody": "Some of my movie friends were stunned when I mentioned in a thread that this was my &quot;People&apos;s Choice Award&quot; vote for TIFF 2018 (it won, btw). I generally go for weightier fare, so my being won over by a PG-13 road film with the familiar &quot;they-couldn&apos;t-have-been-more-different&quot; premise directed by the auteur co-responsible for such recent classics as &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot; and &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; elicited a virtual double-take.\n\nBut I couldn&apos;t help it ... it really WAS the best film I saw (out of 17), and far and away the most entertaining. I think this is largely because it&apos;s based on a real-life story about the beginning of a lifelong friendship - a story that has writing participation by the son of one of the real-life characters. There&apos;s definitely an air of authenticity to the events as they unfold that could never occur with a purely contrived plot. Consider: A college-educated concert pianist of Jamaican descent hires a temporarily-unemployed Italian-American nightclub bouncer who&apos;s streetwise but academically dim to drive him to venues in the Deep South back in 1962. That&apos;s not a setup that a Hollywood script written from scratch would ever have come up with.\n\nThe two lead actors really click. Mahershala Ali makes a nice Oscar follow-up playing the aloof pianist passenger to Viggo Mortensen&apos;s &quot;b.s. artist&quot; driver. Ali is certain to get another nomination; Mortensen&apos;s performance may be a little too broad to garner one, but he delivers exactly what&apos;s called for. And he makes a believable Italian-American, which is impressive considering that he&apos;s Danish.\n\nI&apos;m allergic to preaching and heavy-handedness in movies no matter what the message, and with the exception of one borderline scene, I&apos;d say that the movie nicely sidesteps these proclivities that surface so often in socially-conscious films.\n\nThe music and FX are excellent. When an actor plays a piano player, there&apos;s always the challenge of making the playing look believable. It doesn&apos;t get any better than it gets here - Ali&apos;s piano playing is every bit as convincing as Margot Robbie&apos;s ice skating in I, TONYA. You never see a disconnect between hands and body as he&apos;s filmed against a variety of backgrounds. And if I could bet on an Oscar win right now, it would be Kris Bowers for Best Original Score. (He also supplies Ali&apos;s hands, which should clinch it.)\n\nTop everything off with a Capra-esque Christmas Eve finale and a closing line that sends everyone home smiling, and it all adds up to a monster hit. Its commercial payoff could be huge - the movie practically begs for a TV series spinoff, and the real-life characters remained friends until they both died in 2013.\n\nSo congratulations to Peter Farrelly on his graduation from co-directing lowbrow fare to solo-directing middlebrow (i.e. mass-appeal) fare. You can&apos;t deny the talent and craftsmanship it takes to make a mainstream movie that works as well as this one does.",

      "reviewBody": "This review may be coming a little bit late, considering i saw the movie back in November, but i wanted to check one or two things before i write it.I wanted to see whether or not the movie will receive any Academy awards buzz from the the Golden Globes and the various Guild awards.I wanted to wait, because i could not believe the hype surrounding it.I saw it, and i was not that impressed at all.So after some amount of time has passed and the seven Academy nominations have been announced, i thought it was time for a second viewing, in order to try and change my mind about the movie, but-no.\n\nFirst of all, i enjoyed Gone Baby Gone and The Town of Affleck&apos;s repertoire much more than i did with Argo.I would even recommend Zero Dark Thirty (Bigelow&apos;s recent take on historical events, that are important to American society)ahead of Argo.That being said, Affleck&apos;s based-on-true-story-sci-fi-flick has it&apos;s strenghts.\n\nThe fact that the movie is solid enough and that a thorough enough background-check on the events depicted in it, are made, admittedly do the movie some justice.It&apos;s well and accurately written, but a nomination is as far as it can stretch itself.Never mind the fact that Affleck is still weaker in front of the camera, than he is behind it, this is clearly visible.One might even wonder how he has that experience as an actor and as a director and be so far ahead with the material when at the helm of a movie.\n\nSo, the era is accurately depicted, even the jokes, sets, clothing, music-all fits the bill, although Led Zeppelin&apos;s When the Levee Breaks is probably 10-12 years earlier, thus not from this period.But i&apos;m willing to close my eyes on this one, considering the love i have towards Plant&amp;co.On that subject, Aerosmith and Dream On were more accurately chosen, although only for the trailer.\n\nThe technical part of the movie was almost excellent, i mean there isn&apos;t any breakout aspect to put in the running for some awards (although some people obviously think there is), all in all everything was good enough.Maybe only William Goldenberg can get a nod over the others, but he&apos;ll have stiff competition from his other movie, Zero Dark Thirty and himself.As this is pretty evident by now, he has two nominations in one category for two different movies.So, it will be pretty interesting to see which movie do the critics hold in higher regard-this category will tell.For me, that should be &quot;Zero&quot;.\n\nSo, technically good, historically accurate, even a little tense, so what&apos;s the matter, you might ask.Very simple.Contrary to popular belief, that has been planted in most people&apos;s minds, there actually was no acting in this movie.Not a single part was properly played by nobody, including you, Mr. Arkin.I can&apos;t understand where did this nomination come from, but in my eyes it is totally undeserved.Arkin and Goodman were of course fine, fun to watch, but the parts they played, others have played so long ago and to a better extend.When we start off with Sunset Blvd. and stop at present-day Hank Moody, there are people much more prepared to the challenges of playing a movie guy.Arkin was fine, but for 10 minutes of screen time you just can&apos;t receive that kind of reception and you just can&apos;t make this big of an impact.It is not normal.Not that they are, those awards and guild-members.\n\nSo, if i have to sum it up in a nutshell-the screenplay was good enough, the directing was decent as well, the acting was stiff at best (i&apos;m looking at you, Ben), the era was pretty impressively(although inaccurately story-wise) depicted (still looking at you, Ben), the technical part was top-notch (William Goldberg), but all in all this does not make up for the &quot;masterpiece&quot; many of you claimed it to be.\n\nIf i had to recommend it, i would, simply because of it&apos;s must-see- based-on-true-story(although if we have to go there, discussing how accurate it really is, we&apos;d be in for a long night) factor.But, as i said earlier, i&apos;m not that impressed and there is nothing all that much to be impressed with.And Best Picture?No way!!\n\nMy rate: 6.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Hacksaw Ridge (2016)\n\n**** (out of 4)\n\nThe incredible true story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), a simple man from Virginia who grows up with a strong religious nature, which means that he can not kill anyone. WWII breaks out and Doss believes it&apos;s his duty to sign up but he&apos;s soon butting heads with the people in his troop as he refuses to pick up a gun. They believe him to be a coward and can&apos;t understand his feelings but soon he&apos;s going to have to prove his worth during the battle of Okinawa.\n\nMel Gibson&apos;s HACKSAW RIDGE is a story that probably would have been laughed off the page had it not been based on a true story. Obviously I&apos;m not going to spoil the various plot points in the film but it&apos;s quite remarkable what this young man did. Not only the courage he showed but also the guts it took for him to stand up and do what he believed in. Gibson&apos;s direction is perfect and technically speaking there&apos;s not a single flaw to be found. There&apos;s no question that the film is one of the greatest war movies out there.\n\nWhat makes the film work so wonderfully well is that the drama off the battle field is just as intense as what is on the battle field once we get there. The battle scenes themselves are downright horrific and there about as tense as you&apos;re ever going to witness on a screen. Gibson&apos;s direction through these scenes was terrific and I must say that he managed to put some of the most graphic war scenes that you&apos;re ever going to witness. There&apos;s also a jump scare that happens towards the end, which has to be one of the greatest of any film I&apos;ve seen. There&apos;s no question that you feel the horror that these men felt and it&apos;s just amazing that anyone could go through that and survive.\n\nMany people say SAVING PRIVATE RYAN has the greatest battle scenes and they&apos;re perfect but so are the ones here. What makes this film even greater for me is the fact that the story outside the battle is wonderful. I thought the training sequences were terrific and I thought the abuse that Doss goes through was terrific. Yes, we&apos;ve seen this stuff in countless war movies but the story here is just so great and Gibson does such a wonderful job that you can&apos;t help but feel as if they&apos;re fresh and original. It also helps that the entire cast is so wonderful with Garfield leading the way. He&apos;s simply terrific here and not once do you ever feel as if you&apos;re watching an actor doing a part. You really do feel as if you&apos;re watching a real man battle with his beliefs. Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer are all terrific as well.\n\nI usually hate when a new movie opens and it gets labeled &quot;the greatest&quot; this or &quot;the greatest&quot; that. I honestly think films need time to grow and time to become a classic but I honestly have no reservation calling this film something truly special. It works on every level and it&apos;s really a masterful piece of filmmaking and it shows once again that Gibson is one of the greatest director&apos;s working."

      "reviewBody": "Arguably one of the finest horror comedies of all time is Edgar Wright&apos;s Shaun of the Dead, and since its release in &apos;04, there have been a good number of wannabes. Based on the trailers for Zombieland, however, I thought that the film had some serious potential to match Shaun in terms of quality, possibly even usurp it. Having seen the film, I&apos;m happy to say that Zombieland does just that.\n\nUnlike many comedies in recent memory, in which the majority of laughs are already provided by the trailer, Zombieland is filled to the brim with laugh-out-loud moments, thanks largely to the brilliant cast. Eisenberg is awesome as the main protagonist, Columbus, portraying that sense of vulnerability and awkwardness, without becoming too Michael Cera-like. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are also terrific as the sweet, yet tough Wichita and the more-mature-than-she-seems Little Rock, respectively. \n\nThe real stand-out performance, though, is Woody Harrelson as the Twinkie-lovin&apos;, zombie-hatin&apos; Tallahassee. Next to that of Woody Boyd on Cheers and Frasier, this is definitely the best performance of his career. There&apos;s also a painfully hilarious cameo appearance about mid-way through the film that would be a crime to spoil. Suffice it to say, this is – hands-down – the best cameo that I&apos;ve ever seen in a film.\n\nThe most surprising aspect of Zombieland, to me, is how much heart there is. All of the characters feel warm and alive, and what drama there is to be found feels extremely sincere. Ultimately, you feel invested in the story and the characters, which – I think – is the most important thing any film of any genre can do.\n\nZombieland has instantly become a horror favorite of mine (comedic or otherwise). The – for the lack of a better word – quotable dialogue, consistently hysterical tone, and endearing characters, all come together to create a film that will undoubtedly become a cult classic.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Don&apos;t Look Up&quot; will divide audiences for a myriad of reasons, but personally, I found this to be a brilliant satire about the state of growing misinformation and the dangerous hypocrisies of this digital age.\n\nIt&apos;s chock full of unpleasant characters and unpleasant situations, and viewers need to go-into all of it with a coarse grain of salt. I suspect many detractors of the film might be those easily persuaded by misinformation, and those, who themselves, like to ignore science and tend-to grasp onto these social life-jackets - instead of heeding the poignant and important meaning of the film - they will focus on all the negatives.\n\nThe film is completely absurd, and it&apos;s supposed to be. The style, cast and absurdity just work together harmoniously. Everything about this ridiculous movie is probably not as far removed from reality as one might think. It is over-stylized, no doubt, but it&apos;s Running Man, Hunger Games, Total Recall disinformation-vibe rings true in today&apos;s world, and far sooner than many suspected. It&apos;s like Miracle Mile, Back to the Future 2, Deep Impact and This is the End, had a coma baby birthed-in the somber realities and fact-checks of Bright Lights Big City.\n\nIt&apos;s not perfect. The film would have benefitted from more family development, and a better soundtrack, but any low scores can be dismissed as those who took political offense and missed the point. Cast attacks can be dismissed as well - it&apos;s comedy not a drama. Don&apos;t expect The Color Purple or Bridges of Madison County here.\n\nGood movie. Will surely find a top 25 spot for 2021. Love the extended credits. The film is clever and, imo, an important film.",

      "reviewBody": "I have been highly interested and engrossed in the Zodiac killer story for the last 5 years now and I can say, without doubt, that this is the best and most accurate telling of the story. The film presents numerous details that were unknown to me before seeing it. All of these facts and theories are thrown together in a way that strings the viewer along, you think it&apos;s someone, then you get new information and that person is no longer a suspect. Fincher really puts you into the life of a detective working on the case. You feel just as excited when new information comes about and are equally disappointed when it leads to another dead end.\n\nThe film is beautifully shot (on VIPER digital cameras) and once again, Fincher shows us his wonderfully adept skills with CGI shots. All of the actors shine and truly become their characters. Jake Gyllenhall and Robert Downey Jr. put in excellent performances, as does Mark Ruffalo. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Phillip Baker Hall join the ensemble.\n\nThe only complaint I have heard that holds any water is that the film is too long. At roughly 2 1/2 hours, I can see how many would think that is long, but you have to realize that this is an intricate story with deep characters who need to be examined and understood. A standard 90 minute film, or even a two hour cut, would not have been able to tell the story as well. Character motivation and important details would have been left on the cutting room floor.\n\nIf you have followed the Zodiac case, you will be happy to see how well done this movie is. If you don&apos;t know anything about the case, you will be given an excellent story that will make you want to learn more about it. Regardless, you should do yourself a favor and see this movie. If nothing else, it&apos;s better than &quot;Wild Hogs&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Once Jake Gyllenhaal signed on to do Nightcrawler I knew it would be a special film. The man has been producing nothing but gold lately and this is no different. Nightcrawler is an experience - it takes you on this journey through the grimy streets of LA, through the corrupt minds of media moguls, and everything is told through the eyes of seemingly charming slimeball reporter Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal). \n\nNightcrawler works on so many levels. The writing and direction is fantastic, which is especially impressive as it&apos;s the directorial debut by Dan Gilroy who takes on both duties. He had a clear vision of how he wanted to portray LA and the sleek, brooding yet slightly lackadaisical tone transfers perfectly onto the big screen. The acting is phenomenal - Gyllenhaal gives a performance that&apos;s the polar opposite from his character in Prisoners and he was on point for every second. He was the perfect casting choice to carry the movie.\n\nThe movie has a clear message on the media and how they abuse stories and reap the benefits regardless of who gets victimized. It&apos;s a message that has been told a million times before, but never quite like this. Nightcrawler throws you right into the gritty streets along with a hustling thief, Lou, who starts freelancing as a videographer of crime scenes and selling his footage to a news channel for money. We go along this journey with Lou and watch his transformation from being a sleazy but ambitious individual to becoming a manipulative, self-serving sociopath. Then you start to realize that he was like that all along. His charming charisma masked his true intentions, and this peek into his psyche is the most potent and disturbing aspect of the movie. It&apos;s a character study that encompasses an entire lifestyle, and told with enough elegance and wit to keep you on board the whole way.\n\nThere&apos;s a dark comedic tone present throughout. Lou&apos;s persistence and crass remarks to basically anyone he encounters provide some good laughs. He doesn&apos;t sugarcoat anything, he&apos;ll talk to anyone in order to get his way, and he has a sleazy smirk that never fails to get a reaction. Also Gyllenhaal&apos;s chemistry with Rene Russo (the news director) is palatable and their work dynamic becomes more of a gripping co-dependency as the movie progresses.\n\nNightcrawler is a must-watch for fans of cinema. It&apos;s a work of art from a directorial and writing standpoint, from an acting standpoint, and from a basic human nature standpoint. It really does a hell of a job at sucking you into this dark gloomy world to the point where you don&apos;t want to get out. It&apos;s intense, it&apos;s funny, it&apos;s thrilling, it&apos;s powerful, and most of all, it&apos;s real. Nightcrawler is simply sensational.",

      "reviewBody": "Six years ago, a director by the name of Curtis Hansen came out with a small time film named L.A. Confidential. Though the movie garnered several big nominations at the 1997 Academy Awards, the nation had been swept up by the gigantic and romantic blockbuster, Titanic, thus shrinking the chances of this brilliant movie from garnering any real awards. 1997 completely screwed this phenomenal film, in which three brilliant actors gave the performances of their careers.\n\nRussell Crowe plays Detective Bud White, a tough L.A. cop who bends the rules in order to bring justice to the city. He is ruthless, and unforgiving of anyone, which brings him into direct conflict with Detective Lieutenant Ed Exley, played by Guy Pearce. Russell Crowe became with this role a full pledged character actor,: the cop with a steel physique, and a vulnerable heart. He becomes so believable and real to the audience, you can not help but sympathize for his character under the circumstances.  From this role, Crowe went on to garner three best actor nominations, winning for his role in Gladiator.\n\nGuy Pearce, the little known Australian body builder, became the character known as Ed Exley, a straight, uptight detective trying to live up to the legend his father created before him. Exley has so much to prove to the LAPD, trying to show them that he is just as good, maybe even better, than his father. He plays the politics in a corrupted police department very well, and is able to use these skills in solving the corrupt and mysterious case of the Night Owl murders. This film officially put Guy Pearce in the big leagues of film, making his next appearances in Memento and The Count of Monte Cristo. He is a severely underrated actor who deserves better than what he has been getting.\n\nFinally, the ever wonderful Kevin Spacey. Spacey plays Lieutenant Jack Vincenes, a cop who gives a popular LA police show, Badge of Honor, real solved cases in return for money. Jack sees his life as an ever going soap opera, until he comes across a case that somehow has a connection to the Night Owl murders. Kevin Spacey has proved time and again his abilities as an actor, and he continues with this performance. \n\nCurtis Hansen does a wonderful job bringing this story to the big screen. His talents, although recognized, have not been awarded as of yet. I can only hope that someday, someone will give this amazing director something worthy of his talents. \n\nHighly Recommended. \n\nMJR"

I say a good movie is understandable with one viewing where the viewer is paying attention.\n\nThis is a relatively simple story, told in a complex manner with lots of special effects and aggressive sound track. Our future civilization has figured a way to interact with the past and now, in our PRESENT they intend to correct a problem we caused them, and if necessary destroy the world as we know it. So the PRESENT day leaders have to prevent that.\n\nMy wife and I watched it on a 2-disc DVD set from our public library. Much of the dialog is difficult to understand because the actors often fail to enunciate, so I had to turn on subtitles about half-way through. The second DVD is filled with extras.\n\nIt is a pretty good, entertaining movie, but often very confusing. I would not put it in the top tier of favorite movies. Nolan&apos;s &quot;Inception&quot; for example is a much better movie."

      "reviewBody": "After having seen HP6, I honestly didn&apos;t have great expectations in this one. I guessed it would be darker and scarier, as every HP movie has been darker and scarier than its predecessor. But HP6 was such a patchwork of scenes that didn&apos;t give you the feeling of a coherent work - I was afraid the even more complex story line of HP7 would make an even less coherent movie. However, I must say it was definitely a wise decision to split the 7th book into 2 movies. HP7 can take time to explain and introduce all the characters that are necessary to the plot.\n\nI love the way Voldemort and the Death Eaters are portrayed in this movie. They are no longer just anonymous caped figures. You can see them interacting with each other, discussing and well... being human. Well, I&apos;m always a big fan of the blurring of these clearcut good/evil categories in Fantasy.\n\nAs the book is split into 2 parts, all of a sudden, there&apos;s also time for little embellishments I hadn&apos;t realized I had missed in the earlier movies! For example, I loved the scene so much where the feather floated through the air when the fairy tale of the Three Brothers was being told. Also the drawing style that was used during the story was really amazing. This HP movie was the first of all that finally gave me the same feeling as Lord of the Rings did: Boy, this is not just some guys slavishly adapting a book into a movie, but they&apos;re actually autonomous artists and they have ideas of their own! And I don&apos;t mean they changed the whole plot (I wouldn&apos;t like that)! But (mostly visually) they did more than just bring across what&apos;s in the book.\n\nThis also expresses itself in the decision not to include the childish Harry Potter musical theme (at least I didn&apos;t hear it, correct me if I&apos;m wrong) from the first movie that sounds like &quot;Wow, everything&apos;s so magical here!&quot; That tune was fine for the first movie, but as Harry got older and the movies got darker, it kind of felt like they had to force this theme into every movie several times even though it didn&apos;t really fit any more. Now the soundtrack, too, has finally grown up. And I loved it! Last but not least, the acting was brilliant! The tense atmosphere between Harry, Ron and Hermione really came across. Also with all the doppelgänger scenes, you always still saw from their movements and behaviour which character was which though they were in disguise in a different body.\n\nAll in all, as the title says, this is a excellent grown-up movie and I can recommend it to everyone - except kids! If you have little kids, please don&apos;t take them. This movie has far too many scary scenes and little comic relief! Plus, the plot is quit complex including lots and lots of minor characters. It&apos;s really no longer a movie targeted at kids, even though it&apos;s still labelled &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.",

The movie is by all means, enjoyable. The characters are all likable and their sense of humour makes the movie tick up a notch. I found myself laughing a couple times in the film to the jokes. All the actors played their parts pretty well, but my favorite character of the film had to go to Big Chris as Vinnie Jones. He was the most entertaining and how he was always correcting his son if he ever made any mistakes was priceless. The dialogue was really well done by Guy Ritchie, as well as his directing. What I noticed about the movie, was how much it was alike to the 1992 film, Reservoir Dogs. Lock, Stock had colorful characters, robbery that ends up bad, unexpected tragedies, good screenplay as well as directing by one person, and a good sense of humour. All those resemble to Reservoir Dogs, it&apos;s not even funny. Overall, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a good and entertaining comedy/crime film that shows a good future to Guy Ritchie aka &quot;The Next Quentin Tarantino&quot;, to many. Although it&apos;s not up to par with Reservoir Dogs, I still enjoyed it and will be paying a lot of attention to Guy Ritchie&apos;s films. I recommend it.\n\nHedeen&apos;s Outlook: 8/10 *** B",

      "reviewBody": "Let me say this. Half Blood Prince as a movie alone was very good. It stands it&apos;s ground as a film better than any of the others of the series. But only as a film. And only because there are so many parts to a film. This installment obviously stepped everything up a notch: the cinematography, the special effects, the darker score, the improved acting, etc... But the key element which was boosted this franchise into world-class fame, is the story. And in this one, it&apos;s just not there. As a fan of the books and having had no SERIOUS gripes with any of the other films, I must say i HATED the screenplay for this one. Everything that made the book amazing was ripped from the film, and instead replaced by annoying large quantities of romantic subplot. Yes, there is romance in the sixth book but not shoved down your throat. JK Rowling masterfully crafted a novel that was perfectly balanced. The romance was there although it didn&apos;t detract from the main plot and at times was intertwined with the larger goings-on at hogwarts. In the movie the romance takes up most of the screen time. Not to mention the ending of the film was brutally butchered.\n\nSo much time could have been detracted from the silly romances to focus on more important things which were completely ommitted or deliberately changed. The ending is extremely anti-climactic and once it&apos;s over it&apos;ll leave you in your seat thinking &quot;it&apos;s over?&quot;\n\nMy final gripe with this movie is that it really should have been PG-13. If you&apos;ve read the novel then you know the subject matter is MUCH darker and the story would have been done greater justice with just a higher rating(and a better screenwriter, yes i&apos;m looking at you Steve Kloves).\n\nOverall as a movie i&apos;d give it an 8 out of 10.\n\nBut as a HARRY POTTER movie it gets 4 out of 10. And that&apos;s pushing it.\n\nWell heres to 2010 to see how they screw up the finale. Oh wait, they already did. I didn&apos;t know there were 8 years at hogwarts...",

      "reviewBody": "I feel it needs to be said that this is a superhero movie. We&apos;ve had a myriad of superhero movies in recent years, but only a handful (e.g. the first Iron Man) were films where it seemed to me cast and crew were not fast asleep but actually cared about what they were doing. This is definitely an example of that rare breed. It is one of those movies where you spend the entire length of the film NOT noticing that it is a superhero movie, and quite possibly this will not dawn on you even on the ride home, because the subject matter is handled seriously: the characters are 3d life-like people; the plot has life-like complexity; there is ambiguity and room for interpretation. Somebody cared. I had my doubts, going in, whether Bradley Cooper can pull this one off. He sure can. Other actors are also at the top of their game. (I don&apos;t feel I need to pick out De Niro in particular, here.)\n\nSo, the good: Original, creative writing. Original, creative, beautiful cinematography. Original, creative direction. Interesting throughout. Believable, except when it isn&apos;t trying to be. Good pacing. Well acted.\n\nThe bad: Some scenes stretch credulity. Most by just a little. The fore-last scene is over the top. I loved it. (My wife said: &quot;They&apos;re trying to pull a Tarrantino. Right?&quot; and they were.) I can&apos;t blame anyone who says this scene ruined the movie for him. It isn&apos;t believable. It isn&apos;t consistent with the rest. But it&apos;s definitely where the roller-coaster that is this movie is at its most extreme. By contrast, the last scene left me with a feeling of something missed. It&apos;s like the script saves the best for the sequel.\n\nSo, unfortunately, this movie doesn&apos;t have an ending that makes you forgive it for everything else. Quite on the contrary. It just happens to be so good that I was willing to forgive it its bad ending.",

      "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this movie, sure it isn&apos;t the most original movie ever made or the best, but it was what it set out to be...which is a combo alien attack movie of the 50&apos;s plus an all-star disaster movie of the 70&apos;s.  A lot of critics don&apos;t like this one and a lot of people who think of themselves as critics don&apos;t care much for it either, but it still brought in over 300 million at the box office in the summer of 96.  I thought it was an entertaining film with lots of action and a good dose of comedy as well.  One complaint I have is that it runs a bit long and you feel the time pass not like other movies like &quot;The Two Towers&quot; where it doesn&apos;t feel like all that much time has passed.  Another problem with this movie is that it is best seen in the theater.  This movie has a score of only six at imdb, so a lot of people who saw it probably saw it on TV.  Or if they did see it at the theaters, realized it just wasn&apos;t as good on the small screen when they saw it on TV. The movie also benefited from a great ad campaign that started with a super bowl spot that showed the White House being destroyed.  The movie is basically an alien invasion movie and it is like a 50&apos;s science fiction movie.  It also has a lot of stars, not the biggest names, just like a 70&apos;s disaster flick.  If you don&apos;t care for either of these genres you probably won&apos;t like this movie, but if you like one or the other or both it is worth checking out.  Just don&apos;t take it too seriously and have fun watching it.",

      "reviewBody": "As someone with a longstanding fondness for most things Trek (I&apos;ve seen most of the movies and quite a few of the shows), I have to say that JJ &amp; Co did a fine job with this picture; the character dynamics were broadly satisfying, the action scenes entertaining and the set pieces well put together. Most of all I was impressed with the lightness of touch of the whole venture - it would be very easy to criticise the picture for making what could be considered significant changes to certain parts of Trek lore, but given that the changes were accomplished with such comfort and confidence makes them, in my view, perfectly acceptable.\n\nWith regards to the acting characterisation, everyone was pretty much solid, with perhaps the exception of Sulu, who I thought didn&apos;t have much to do. Kudos, though, to Zoe Saldana&apos;s loveliness as Uhura and also, especially, to Chris Pine as Kirk - I had always thought Spock was my favourite character, but it looks like I may have to reassess; Pine lives and breathes that Kirk moxie exquisitely and he&apos;ll be great fun to watch in future instalments.\n\nWith regards to plot, it&apos;s pretty good; there is a decent sense of internal logic to it, without it being too overwrought. True, there are a number of points where you might think, &quot;Blimey, that&apos;s serendipitous,&quot; but as I&apos;d already suspended my disbelief to accept the possibility of time travelling green-blooded alien from the planet Vulcan, these things really didn&apos;t bother me at all. Plus there were a number of points in the movie where they were saying, &quot;We were pulling this kind of shtick 20+ years ago, and you loved it then; run with us on this one,&quot; and I was happy to.\n\nOh, and most importantly of all, the movie is fun; it has the good sense to not take itself too seriously, despite remaining well aware of that sense of pomp and importance that all great character dramas should have, and that isn&apos;t a bad thing at all.\n\nHow this movie will bear up to repeat viewings, I&apos;m not certain yet, but at the premiere, it was a blast.\n\nAddendum: It&apos;s a month plus since I originally wrote this and I have seen the film three times in total now - the opening ten minutes remain a manipulative marvel that the remainder of the film struggles to match, the coincidences and conveniences seem even more far fetched than ever and the jokes seem even more silly BUT I still fancy seeing it again, so I guess it must work for me.",

      "reviewBody": "Have a lot of appreciation for Queen. Not a favourite band of mine by all means, but it is difficult to not understand their importance and appeal. They had some iconic songs (namely &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; and &quot;Don&apos;t Stop Me Now&quot;) and Freddie Mercury&apos;s immediately recognisable vocals and Brian May&apos;s virtuosic guitar playing were always out of this world.\n\n&apos;Bohemian Rhapsody&apos; fascinated me when hearing about it and became most of my most anticipated films for the year. When hearing some negativity for the film, my expectations lowered a little, but saw it anyway because it did look and sound good. It did turn out to be a good decision, it is good to see that others here loved it and don&apos;t agree with the mixed critical reception respectfully.\n\nSure there are clichés (such as what some of the rest of Queen say) , but very few films are not and many are much worse in this regard. Like a lot of biopics, there are inaccuracies that may drive die-hard Queen fans into a frenzy, and the odd factual distortion, but again &apos;Bohemian Rhapsody&apos; is not the first or worst film to do this and am going to judge it as a film on its own and not on a documentary level.\n\nAs a film on its own terms, &apos;Bohemian Rhapsody&apos; has an awful lot to admire. Getting the issues out of the way, the ones that could have been handled much better was the with the revelation of Freddie Mercury&apos;s AIDs diagnosis to the rest of the band, could have been done with more tact and less crass (like saying what it was a consequence of) and revealed too early and at the wrong time, and the implications with the phone ringing off post-taking centre stage that the event was a flop when it actually was a triumph.\n\nSome of the early parts were a touch rushed as well, Mercury&apos;s ascent to stardom could have been less breakneck.\n\nHowever, &apos;Bohemian Rhapsody&apos; is stylishly film and evokes the period beautifully. As to be expected, the songs are incredible and will be embedded in your brain for a long time, then again it is Queen of course. They are affectionately staged and performed in a way that made me remember what made me appreciate Queen in the first place.\n\nDidn&apos;t find the script that simplistic or cliff-notes like, while there is a nice mix of moment of laughter, tension and tears and enough parts that entertained and informed, if not as in depth as it should. The story is never dull and the Live Aid depiction is both rousing and poignant. It&apos;s capably directed and while all the performances are fine if underused, it is Rami Malek&apos;s outstanding turn as Mercury that will live long in the memory, true to what made Mercury so interesting a person and performer without being an impersonation.\n\nConcluding, impressively done and better than anticipated. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "The TV series of 21 Jump Street is always remembered as one of Johnny Depp&apos;s early performances. The concept is a bit interesting. At first glance, this movie looks like it&apos;s just another mediocre raucous comedy, but it turns out to be a clever one. It&apos;s quite a surprise. It stays loyal to its roots except it added some raunchiness and slapstick humor to the story. It&apos;s a new kind of 21 Jump Street that is much more fun.\n\nI&apos;m not saying it&apos;s better than the TV series though. Both are pretty interesting but this one is definitely aiming as a comedy. The film is just crazy stuff with crazy characters living in an absurd setting. The original premise remains but with some buddy comedy elements, and raunchy and slapstick humor. Surprisingly, it works better to the plot. The humor is clever and quite hilarious. These jokes are greatly executed by the stars. Jonah Hill is always a brilliant comedian. Channing Tatum finally plays a none bland character. His chemistry with Hill shines to the film. While the others, Ice Cube hams it up a little but he can provide some laughs. Rob Riggle is just being Rob Riggle. Dave Franco&apos;s role here kind of reminds me of his role in Fright Night but he&apos;s pretty good with it.\n\nThe direction is snappy and stylish. The action is fun but I don&apos;t think anybody cares about that. The main point of this film is High School and the relationship between Schmidt and Jenko. It shows how the new high school turned their lives upside down. They can&apos;t stop playing with their antics on their mission. There is a drama between them. Most of it played as a joke but the heart is always there.\n\nAll turns out to be pretty well in this film even with all the changes and the absurdity. It&apos;s smart, sweet, hilarious, and fun. The fans of the TV series may still get a surprise while they miss the none mad Captain Jenko and the charms of the show. This film is too crazy and absurd but in a clever way. I haven&apos;t enjoyed a comedy like this in a while. 21 Jump Street is undeniably fun and it&apos;s probably one of the best comedies of the year.",

      "reviewBody": "Only a poor soundtrack filled with contemporary music spoiled this latest version of The Great Gatsby for me. In a tradition of blond Gatsbys, Leonardo DiCaprio steps into the shoes of Alan Ladd and Robert Redford in essaying the part of the social climbing bootlegger from the Roaring Twenties. All that will make Jay Gatsby&apos;s life complete is the love of Daisy Buchanan whom he courted before his service in World War I. The problem is that she&apos;s slightly married to upper class Tom Buchanan. Daisy is played by Carey Mulligan and Buchanan is played by Australian player Joel Edgerton.\n\nIn fact except for DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway the whole cast is mostly Australian which is to be expected since most of the production was shot there. I have to say that the Australian studio did a marvelous job in recreating New York of the Twenties and the ritzy and glamorous part of Long Island where most of the story takes place.\n\nAs the book is written in the person of Nick Carraway it was also a good move to have Maguire narrate the story. Tobey&apos;s narration gives us the background of the story and Carraway&apos;s character functions as he should.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio does a wonderful job playing the social climbing Gatsby who weaves his own legend as he gives fabled parties on Long Island where the illegal liquor flows freely. Beneath his self assurance there is a bit of a frightened edge like this is all going to be taken away from him so enjoy while you can. \n\nPerhaps the producers thought that no one would see a film with old music in it. There is some there, Gershwin&apos;s Rhapsody In Blue comes to mind. But the contemporary music on the soundtrack is jarring and out of place.\n\nBut overall this is a good telling of F. Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s tale of the Roaring Twenties.",

As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.\n\nAnyway, I embraced the journey and I&apos;m glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:\n\nIn Greta Gerwig&apos;s latest directorial venture, &quot;Barbie,&quot; the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.\n\nWith Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig&apos;s live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.\n\nGerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie&apos;s role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.\n\nCan a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?\n\nGerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.\n\nIn reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I&apos;m giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.",

      "name": "When there is no more room in hell, Shaun will walk the earth and...",
      "reviewBody": "...He&apos;ll kill some zombies too! Brace yourself for some nonstop zombie action and laughs with the delightful horror-comedy &quot;Shaun of the Dead.&quot;\n\nArmed with a cricket bat, razor-sharp wit, and an attitude, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is perhaps the last guy that you&apos;d want to save the world from the legions of the living dead that have suddenly begun to storm the London neighborhood where he lives. It could be stated, as this is a running gag here, that we&apos;re all dying slow deaths, so it&apos;s no surprise that when zombies begin to eat the flesh of the living, Shaun couldn&apos;t be any more oblivious to the chaos that has gripped most of London.\n\nShaun loves his dead-end existence of wasting his days at the Winchester, a local pub, with his friend and flat mate Ed (Nick Frost). The film&apos;s money shot arrives about 20 minutes in, when Shaun, hungover from a hard night&apos;s drinking, goes to the store and because he&apos;s so hungover and is worried about his ex-girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), he doesn&apos;t even notice that the street behind him is teeming with the living dead.\n\nWhile in the store buying a beverage, he doesn&apos;t notice the bloody handprints on the refrigerator door and he almost slips in a puddle of blood. I was quite amazed at the response this film got from people in the theater: it seemed that every time something funny happened, the response was almost always with riotous laughter.\n\nStraight from Britain, we have what is certainly one of the most original horror movies to come out in a long time. Even in a genre that embraces gore, &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; is fairly light on it (at least for the first 45 minutes) and is dominated by laughs galore.\n\nYou may remember the character of &quot;Ash&quot; (Bruce Campbell of &quot;Evil Dead&quot; fame), who has remained pretty much the supreme demon slayer in the horror genre. But you know, Campbell&apos;s pushed past 40 and people today may not be weary of his history slaying evil Deadites in Sam Raimi&apos;s notorious film series. So maybe with &quot;Shaun of the Dead,&quot; the torch has been passed to Simon Pegg, who slays more than his fair share of the living dead in this film.\n\nIt&apos;s pretty obvious that &quot;SOTD&quot; was greatly influenced by the works of George A. Romero (the director of 1978&apos;s supreme epic of zombie action-mayhem &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;) and 2002&apos;s &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (directed by Danny Boyle). There are little itty-bitty references to the two zombie flicks throughout the movie.\n\nGranted &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; is aimed largely at the gorehounds who idolized Romero&apos;s &quot;Living Dead&quot; trilogy, but it&apos;s also the first zombie flick to attempt making a hit with the mainstream. I guarantee any viewers out there that you&apos;ll spend more time laughing than you will being frightened.\n\n10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Ex Machina has a very fitting sense of false intimacy. This is done visually as many of the close-ups are seen through glass. No matter how close we get to the subject on-screen, there always seems to be at least one wall of glass between us and it or them. The film also makes a very distinct contrast between it&apos;s interior and exterior shots. Outside of the facility is breathtaking landscapes. It is big, beautiful, refreshing and vibrant. Inside seems like an endless futuristic maze of glass, mirrors, plastic, chrome and dim lights. It is clean, cold and claustrophobic. A perfect setting for the subject that is explored in this tight, tense sci-fi thriller.\n\nEx Machina is the best science fiction film on artificial intelligence since Blade Runner. While Blade Runner is an action thriller that relies more on it&apos;s epic visuals to tell it&apos;s story, Ex Machina is a dialogue-driven psychological thriller that slowly works it&apos;s way under your skin. Thought-provoking and terrifyingly suspenseful, an induced state of paranoia may linger long after the end credits begin to roll.\n\nThe less you know going into a film like this, the better your experience will be. Alex Garland has given us a modern science-fiction masterpiece. Performances from all three leads are flawless and every other aspect of the production, from the cinematography to the soundtrack, is perfectly suited for the story. Not only is Ex Machina an amazing achievement for a directorial debut, it&apos;s Alex Garland&apos;s best written work to-date.",

      "reviewBody": "Sitting here the day after viewing Rian Johnson&apos;s Looper, parts of it are still falling in to place. Standing out amongst this years crop of mostly underwhelming sequels and comic book adaptations, Looper thunders onto the screen, showing, much like Inception did two years ago, that there is a place in 2012 for fresh material and just how good it can be when it&apos;s done right.\n\nThe film tells the story of Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a hit-man for an organised crime syndicate tasked with assassinating targets sent from the future. After being confronted with his future self (Bruce Willis) and failing to perform, Young Joe is forced to track down Old Joe and finish the job before being tracked down himself by the nefarious mob led by Abe (Jeff Daniels). However there is much more to the story than the basic premise, and Johnson isn&apos;t afraid to keep details close to his chest until later in the film than most movies of this type, so I won&apos;t spoil them here.\n\nWhile certainly paying subtle homage to its predecessors, Looper is a stunningly original sci-fi masterpiece, vastly superior to any of the higher profile action releases this year. While certainly made on a much larger playing field than Johnson&apos;s previous work (Brick, The Brothers Bloom), there is still a small-scale, independent feel to the film, and it benefits from clearly staying completely under the control of the young director. Delivering excitement sprinkled with thoughtful themes of personal sacrifice, he offers us much to chew on.\n\nJohnson understands that a successful action film doesn&apos;t need an explosion every ten minutes, and allows ample time for developing character and story, something which will likely divide audiences. Looper is very deliberately constructed, and after the highly charged opening establishing the intricate time-travel premise and direction of the plot, Johnson scales back the action almost too much as he ambitiously juggles the many and varied story elements he has created. Thankfully, any weakness in the middle of the film is largely overshadowed as Johnson launches the third act with such ferocity that the stark change of pace leaves you breathless.\n\nDespite the problems in the middle of the film, Looper overcomes its flaws purely by being that rare beast in Hollywood nowadays, the totally original script. Not an adaptation, not a sequel or remake, but a fresh idea from the mind of an immensely talented young film-maker. In a perfect world, Looper would be the game changer it deserves to be, slapping Hollywood studios across the face and announcing that not everything has to be a PG-13 franchise based on a comic book. It&apos;s unlikely that this will the case, and it remains to be seen whether or not the film will even be a success, but it&apos;s encouraging to see that there are young auteurs at work who are fighting to craft new and exciting stories, even if we only get to see the results every year or two.\n\ntinribs27.wordpress.com",

      "reviewBody": "Since Toy Story 3 is in theatres, it&apos;s rather knee-jerk to compare Despicable Me to the animation giant. But you shouldn&apos;t. Despicable Me doesn&apos;t have the heavy, dark tones of the final Toy Story and, therefore, is probably better suited to smaller children. As with the best family films, though, adults will love this story as much - if not more - than their little ones.\n\nAnd here&apos;s why. It is incredibly rare to see a single dad portrayed in such a positive light. While Gru has an admittedly &quot;bad&quot; vocation, there are unbelievably sweet moments between him and the three children, probably aided by the juxtaposition of tiny girls to a large, &quot;bad&quot; guy.\n\nThe nepotistic supporting cast from Saturday Night Live (even Jack McBrayer works for Tina Fey) is fantastic. One pleasant surprise was from Gru&apos;s minions: they did not steal the show. Not that they should&apos;ve- the little yellow guys were funny and entertaining, but one would expect from the previews they would ultimately be the best part of the film... and I&apos;m happy to report that wasn&apos;t true.\n\nDespicable Me is LOL funny throughout, warm, goofy, and will not disappoint. I&apos;d say you&apos;re a despicable parent if you don&apos;t take your kids to see it immediately.",

      "reviewBody": "First of all, this is movie is my all-time favorite, out of all the hundreds of films I have seen. However, every time I mention this film, I have to answer most people&apos;s quizzical looks with &quot;It&apos;s a beautiful little 80s film that stayed in the 80s.&quot; After seeing it for the 24th time since I first saw it 5 years ago, on my 13th birthday, I can gladly say that this movie went far and beyond the 80s, and the power and inspiration of the message can be felt every day.\n\nDead Poets Society is a most underrated film by a most underrated director whose inspiring, uplifting and moral tales firmly grounded in reality are not nearly as appreciated as they should be. Here, we see one of his very personal and cradled projects, and he shows the visual style and concentration on characters in which he is so affluent. His control of the camera and the characters are very strong and very smooth. The cinematography is near perfect, with every shot, along with the editing, seamless. Also very compelling are the color-tones in every scene, perfectly matching the mood and events of the scene. Could you say this is art? Absolutely.\n\nThen we have the performances. Robin Williams continues in stride as one who has to-date remained the most touching, heart-wrenching, awe-inspiring comedians with inarguable acting talent (he still remains my most favorite performer on the film screen). His Professor John Keating is a man who embodies every professor who you thought was cool and respectable, every person who taught or enlightened you in something out of the ordinary. In fact - dare I say it? - he teaches something EXTRAORDINARY! We have the tragically underrated Robert Sean Leonard in his role as the free-thinking catalyst student Neil. Why is this man not a household name/Hollywood heavyweight? His roles are always full of inspiration, energy, and tragic emotion that never fail to move an audience. His role in this movie is fresh, unhindered, and never pretentious as the cautionary tale of the movie. And then we have Ethan Hawke in one of his earliest roles as the point-of-view character. The entire supporting cast is very strong, also, providing the foundation and serve as the various emotional ties that further involve us in the story. Josh Charles&apos;s role as Knox Overstreet is a role that almost all guys can relate to wholeheartedly. And of course, all the actors who are in that Dead Poets Society do a fine job.\n\nAnd lastly, the story. I won&apos;t summarize it since it&apos;s been summarized many times here, but I will say that it is one of the best coming of age stories for not only adolescents, but anyone. I have personally heard from nine-to-fivers who were inspired by this movie to change the situations of their jobs, careers, relationships for the better. I first saw this movie when I was 13, and immediately stamped, crowned and elevated this movie as my all-time favorite. Now that I am 18 and living on my own, with very different concerns than back then, I turn back to this movie over and over again, to find inspiration, solace and of course, entertainment. It is still my all-time favorite, and it still inspires me to seize the day and make my life extraordinary.",

It is an excellent movie. Although it was not filmed in Sierra Leone, it captures the reality of the country to a remarkable degree. There is a great deal of violence in this movie, but that violence is organic, realistic, fitting to what happened there. They even manage to convey the fact that the people are as astonished by this violence as we are; Sierra Leone used to be one of the safest countries in the world. The movie tells the facts about conflict diamonds quickly and accurately. DiCaprio&apos;s performance is impressive, certainly the best by him I&apos;ve ever seen: he is totally believable as a white African. Jennifer Connelly&apos;s role is much smaller but she makes the most of it. Djiman Housou has enormous physical presence as the brave Mende fisherman. This movie just gets so many things right that the few places it departs from reality are entirely forgivable. I would heartily recommend this movie to everyone; it is the best Hollywood movie I&apos;ve seen in years.",

Here we have one of the greatest directors alive (Steven Spielberg), a very big star (Tom Cruise) with a great ensemble (Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Peter Stormare, Samantha Morton, Tim Blake Nelson) around him, a good cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and a nice score by John Williams all packed in a great story (based on the novel by Philip K. Dick) with perfect visual effects.\n\nIn the year 2054 murders can be predicted and stopped before they happen. If you were about to kill but stopped you are locked. Tom Cruise is one of the agents who stops those murders. Then he discovers the next murder they have to stop will be committed by himself.\n\nI will not reveal more of the plot. The story itself is great. It is intelligent, but also exciting with great action scenes. The visuals are truly beautiful and perfectly support the sci-fi story. If you like action thrillers and you don&apos;t mind they are set in the future (with some futuristic gadgets) this is your film. 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Continuing a movie as perfect as &quot;Back To The Future&quot; must have been a really tough job. What made it even harder was that the writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale had to ignore an important character from part one. Because Crispin Glover asked for too much money, his character George McFly, Marty&apos;s wacky Dad, hardly appears in the sequels, which constricted the storyline a lot beforehand.\n\nStill, &quot;Back To The Future II&quot; turned out to be a huge success, commercially and artistically. The movie is every bit as clever and delightful as part one. I think most viewers don&apos;t realize how extremely complex this story is, because it&apos;s so enjoyable to watch. Gale &amp; Zemeckis wrote a screenplay that takes place in three different periods of time, changes storyline more than once, has characters interacting with themselves all the time, but never seems overdone or confusing. The most original trick the two Bobs pulled was to virtually return to part one and have the main character interfere with the original storyline. I don&apos;t think that has ever been done before or since.\n\nNo, the movie isn&apos;t flawless in a sense that everything can be explained logically. Bob Gale admitted himself that Marty and Doc shouldn&apos;t be able to visit their future selves in the first place. There are a lot of impossible time travels in part two (you can read about them in detail here: http://mjyoung.net/time/back2.html). &quot;Mistakes&quot; like that don&apos;t take away any of the fun, though, and I still think that the &quot;Back To The Future&quot; trilogy incorporates the logics of time traveling better than any other movie ever did.\n\nBesides the perfect script the trilogy&apos;s success is due to Zemeckis ever so beautiful direction and his eye for detail, and of course the great cast. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F. Wilson and Lea Thompson, all shamelessly underrated actors, are once again brilliant. It&apos;s a REAL pity that Crispin Glover didn&apos;t return for the sequels, but as I&apos;ve said before, Gale &amp; Zemeckis did a great job writing their way around his memorable character. The only other actress that didn&apos;t come back was Claudia Wells, who played Jennifer in part one and was appropriately replaced by Elisabeth Shue here.\n\nSumming up, &quot;Back To The Future II&quot; is a more than worthy follow-up to one of the best movies of all time. In fact, I think it&apos;s the best sequel ever made, only rivaled by &quot;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&quot;. But that&apos;s a different story...",

      "reviewBody": "The key with The Conjuring is not that it has freshness on its side, as evidenced by the ream of horror fans arguing on internet sites about &quot;nothing new on the table&quot; , but while those fans will be going hungry for a very, very long time, The Conjuring does everything right for the splinter of horror it deals with.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot to admire about a horror film that in this day and age stands tall and proud against the ream of remakes, sequels and teen friendly slashers that &quot;haunt&quot; the multiplexes with all too much frequency these days. Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.\n\nForget the &quot;based on a true story&quot; tag, since it&apos;s kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it&apos;s a selling gimmick that actually means &quot;this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit&quot;. Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.\n\nStory essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren&apos;s to get involved.\n\nThere is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the cliché conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan&apos;s talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls – breath holding games of hide and seek – to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.\n\nThe script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara&apos;s musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it&apos;s a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn&apos;t resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti&apos;s cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.\n\nMet with critical and box office success, The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "After watching this movie, I have to say, I don&apos;t understand all the one and two star reviews. This is a return to form for the director of the excellent SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE. I haven&apos;t enjoyed most of his output since those first two films, but only titles like his misguided LAST AIRBENDER and the truly terrible THE HAPPENING are deserving of such low marks. I&apos;ve seen a few real one star movies, and SPLIT isn&apos;t one of them. It&apos;s definitely worthy of higher marks. I can only assume those who didn&apos;t like it are trying to lower the average rather than rank it realistically somewhere closer to 4 or 5 stars (although I&apos;d rank it higher).\n\nIt&apos;s a lot of fun. James MacAvoy is great in a subgenre that is normally pretty insipid (ie dissociative identity disorder movies). He deliveres a great performance that really helps to carry this film, and Betty Buckley also gives a notably outstanding performance in her supporting role.\n\nIs it as good as THE SIXTH SENSE? No. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. I&apos;d happily see it again.\n\nAs for those reviewers who are upset that movies like this distort the public perceptions about mental illness, I can only assume they are too close to that subject to be truly objective.",

I will say that Will Smith was shockingly good now that he&apos;s paid his dues with &quot;Men in Black&quot; and &quot;Bad Boys.&quot;\n\nI was very happy that this film never got political and blamed Reagan for the number of &quot;down on their luck&quot; people that were shown, nor was the race card ever pulled out. It was also refreshing that Smith&apos;s character never blamed anybody for his troubles.\n\nIt&apos;s very funny at parts, but be prepared for some serious drama. In no ways is it cliché or contrived or boring. Let&apos;s just say that&apos;s it not Oliver Stone dramatic. This truly is a must see. To say &quot;I laughed, I cried&quot; would be really lame. It is the truth, though. \n\nWe know that Scorsese&apos;s crowning achievement &quot;The Departed&quot; is going to take the cake at the Oscars, and I won&apos;t be complaining.

      "name": "Well worth watching the watchmen",
      "reviewBody": "The graphic novel source material is a masterpiece, bold, uncompromising, subtle, witty, imaginative with very unique characters and an immersive world. Albeit one that is near-unfilmable, with the themes, the huge amount of content and the amount of depth needed, a three hour film sounded nowhere near enough on paper. Plus Zack Snyder is nowhere near close to being a favourite of mine, but saw &apos;Watchmen&apos; anyway because of my love for the source material, that it looked fantastic and because the cast are very talented.\n\n&apos;Watchmen&apos; really is well worth your time. More the director&apos;s cut though than the theatrical release, though both versions have the exact same brilliant qualities. Of which there are many in &apos;Watchmen&apos;. It is a prime example of how to transcribe a graphic novel to film, while not being as good and not having everything there, and still be near-great on its own terms. It is by far Snyder&apos;s best film in my view, as well as being his most mature and ambitious, being the only one to be above good and be more than style over substance. His other films left me mixed to indifferent.\n\nIs &apos;Watchmen&apos; perfect? No. It does feature one of the most uncomfortable-feeling and pointless love scenes on film, and Leonard Cohen (well certainly for the song in question, it is a great song that is not well used) has never been used more awkwardly in visual media in my view (partly because in my opinion it doesn&apos;t fit with the context of the scene).\n\nMatthew Goode is also a bit too stiff and subdued as Ozymandias. Actually do prefer Jeremy Irons&apos; more eccentric and all out portrayal in the recent series, despite the character being a lot less puzzling here. So it is easy to see why &apos;Watchmen&apos; is a divisive film, though more for its heavy, polarising themes, the huge length (that sounds overlong on paper), that figuring out what&apos;s going on admittedly is not easy for anybody who is not familiar with the graphic novel and it seems that the ending has left people divided (the ending in the source material sparks much debate as well).\n\nFor all of the flaws mentioned, so much works in &apos;Watchmen&apos;s&apos; favour. It looks amazing for one thing. Very stylish and imaginative with some incredible special effects, there is nowhere near as much gratuitous slow-motion here than seen in some of Snyder&apos;s other work. The opening sequence is absolutely amazing in as jaw-dropping a way as you can get, what a way to start a film. The music is nostalgic and atmospheric, with mostly inspired use of great songs. Only the Cohen song in the scene in question is questionable. Snyder&apos;s direction is some of his most ambitious and doesn&apos;t try to do too much to the same extent as his other films.\n\nMoreover, the script compels, flows naturally and raises interesting ideas that provokes thought, managing not to trivialise its difficult content. A good deal of talk but not too exposition-heavy, even when focused on Dr Manhattan in the middle act. There is not much subtlety here, Snyder and subtlety never belonged in the same sentence, but the ironic wit translates well to film from the graphic novel as does the maturity. The length is a long one, but the source material is massive so the film really needed to be long. If anything, in terms of adapting it would be better a mini-series. The story makes the most of getting one immersed in an authentically rendered world, and thematically it is bold and executed in an unforgivably uncompromising approach as ought. The violence shocks but didn&apos;t come over as gratuitous and the action thrills. Didn&apos;t have much of a problem with the ending, but can see why others would, the climax is thrillingly staged at least.\n\nA good job is done with the characters, though Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias is underused and a bit underdeveloped. Night Owl and in particular Rorschach being the standouts, though The Comedian is also a difficult role to pull off. Apart from reservations with Goode, the performances are strong. Jackie Earle Haley is perfect casting as Rorschach, and have no qualms with Billy Crudup, Patrick Wilson and Jeffrey Dean Morgan either. The most difficult roles, pulled off beautifully.\n\nOverall, very good and nearly great, with a lot done extremely well with a couple of misgivings. The polarisation is understandable but the appeal is even more so. The recent adaptation, despite getting a lot of over the top hate very prematurely into its run is also worth seeing. It is a slow starter and ends anti-climactically but there is so much brilliant about it, and if one sticks with it if put off by the first couple of episodes it to me and others got a lot better. 8/10",

Superlative sequel and a boost of hyperactive energy in the franchise&apos;s arm in the second chapter of the Marvel Comics&apos; cult classic this time with good mutants teaming with bad to stop a bent human military advisor (hissable Cox) out to wipe out both types at any cost. Far-out special effects, new characters (particularly winning is Cumming as the blue-skinned Night Crawler) and non-stop action packaged with kinetic infectious giddiness. Jackman continues to amaze as the tormented Wolverine, Berry is given more to do as the tempestuous Storm, Janssen&apos;s Jane Grey is perhaps the most nuanced in her suddenly advance telekinetic skills and McKellen is wellmagnetic as Magneto. Fun tongue-in-cheek screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris (w/ David Hayter, Zak Penn and director Bryan Singer getting story credits) keeps up with the multi-layered storyline encompassing class welfare, social strata and in general to accept one for who they are and not what they are.

      "reviewBody": "Bruh. SO many of the reviews are just &quot;wahhh all women are lying TRASH!! &gt;:(&quot; Y&apos;all are obviously missing the point. The point is that this is REAL. I don&apos;t know why people are saying she&apos;s a liar when she isn&apos;t. She&apos;s very upfront about what she wants because that&apos;s genuinely what she thought. But then things escalated. That&apos;s how it works sometimes. Just because we think we want something doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;ll work out that way. And people get caught up. And by the time she was too far in she realized it was too late and he was in love. That doesn&apos;t make her a liar, it makes her human. Summer could&apos;ve handled it better. Hanson could&apos;ve also handled it better. He knew her intentions going in, but he got caught up. Just like the rest of us. It happens. There&apos;s no villain here, just human beings. If you&apos;re just gonna watch this movie and cry about how all women are evil because you&apos;re a pathetic excuse of a human, then please exit. This movie is heartbreaking, but also a good lesson. It may not be for everyone and that&apos;s ok, but no need to blame an entire gender for something a fictional character did (even though she didn&apos;t? Still confused where the &quot;she&apos;s a liar&quot; thing came in...). Watch this if you&apos;ve ever gotten carried away with love, and hopefully you see the beauty :)",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. From the opening scene it is clear we aren&apos;t in for a typically lame rom-com with caricatures instead of characters and punchlines instead of feelings. Instead, this one is all about the characters and their feelings ... realistic feelings of pain, anger, hope and frustration. Now don&apos;t misunderstand. It doesn&apos;t go too deep and there is still plenty of humor in the moments.\n\nCal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) are sharing one of their many restaurant moments over the course of their long, steady marriage. Only this time, something spoils the comfort zone. Emily says she wants a divorce and later tells Cal that she had an affair with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). What follows is as close to real life reactions as we could ever hope for in a rom-com. Cal is hurt. The kids are angry. Emily is confused. Their friends take sides.\n\nThe intertwining story lines and characters are both sad and funny. We see how people react when they are attracted to others ... or not. We see how people react when they wonder if their decision was rash. We see how basically nice people try to do the right thing for themselves and others, but still mess it up sometimes.\n\nAfter moving out, Cal heads to a local upscale lounge that seems to be stocked with gorgeous women and only a handful of men ... every night. In real life, the line of men waiting to enter would be wrapped around the block. Still, one of the regulars is Jacob, played by Ryan Gosling. He is a thing of beauty to look at it and always quick with just the right line. His science is making women believe he cares about nothing but them. Cal is discouraged by Jacob&apos;s incredible success rate. Jacob notices Cal&apos;s negative vibe and agrees to train him. But first, the makeover ... wardrobe, haircut and conversation skills.\n\nThe polar opposite effect of what you might expect from Hollywood - these nice people begin to question their direction. Cal longs for Emily. Emily still thinks about Cal, but dates her co-worker. The son (Jonah Bobo) has a crush on the older baby-sitter, who has a crush of her own. Even Jacob falls hard for new attorney Hannah (Emma Stone) who has just walked out on her wet rag boyfriend (Josh Groban) who offered her a job, rather than a ring. Oh what a tangled web we weave. And that&apos;s just the stuff I can tell you! Cal&apos;s first conquest utilizing his newly learned skills is a teacher played with full energy by the terrific Marisa Tomei. She only has a couple of scenes, but as usual, Ms. Tomei makes the most of her screen time. The baby sitter is played well by Analeigh Tipton, but it&apos;s interesting to note (in real life) she is 3 days younger than law school grad Hannah (Stone).\n\nAll of the actors are top notch here. Steve Carell continues to get better ... this is a superior movie to Date Night (with Tina Fey). Julianne Moore is solid, though her character is mostly mopey. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are both outstanding. Gosling is none for mostly offbeat, dark independent films but shows again how easily he slides back into sex symbol. Ms. Stone is headed for super-stardom. She was really good in Easy A and has a star-making turn in the upcoming film The Help. After that, it&apos;s on to the new Spider-Man for her.\n\nGlenn Ficarra and John Requa are the co-directors and were responsible for the much less mainstream I Love You Phillip Morris, with Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. Surprisingly the film was written by Dan Fogelman, who is known for his script writing on the animated Cars movies.\n\nNo question women will enjoy the film, but the surprise is, many men will relate to what&apos;s going on with the Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling characters. There is enough humor to keep everyone happy and enough strong writing to say this is a very good movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I have grown extremely tired of the typical formula spy film like Bond, or the juvenile stunt exhibition &quot;Triple X.&quot; There have been a bare handful of spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers, especially recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less substance than cotton candy.\n\nBesides &quot;The Bourne Identity,&quot; &quot;Ronin&quot; is the only other recent spy movie I can think of that didn&apos;t feature skydiving, bungie jumping, skiing downhill while shooting innumerable bad guys, laser pens, cars with ejection seats, or silicone breasted women with names you&apos;d be vaguely embarrassed to say in front of your mother. Most of the crap that passes for an espionage film has no plot or reason for existing other than to meet a quota of explosions and cleavage in order to draw the summer action film crowd.\n\nWhile &quot;Bourne&quot; does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent and focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with having no memory of his past, being hunted without knowing why. Some people have complained about being confused by the movie. I for one, do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information. If you can&apos;t handle a little of that, you probably should stick to Disney films or TV&apos;s Scooby Doo where everything is explained in the end. We never find out about what is in the case in &quot;Ronin&quot; and I can live without some information being filled in about Bourne&apos;s past.\n\nTo those who have moaned about the incompatibility of the book and the movie, seek help. There are probably several things that work in the book that would either be boring and take too much screen time to explain, or would be viewed as cliche to modern screen audiences. As I remember, I liked the book, and I definitely like this movie. I view any movie adaptation as an interpretation of the book rather than a translation from words to pictures anyway.\n\nAs for realism, most of the action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets are to be seen, no incredibly lovely models fall madly in bed with Bourne, and the hero shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competance. As someone who has trained in martial arts for over 10 years, unrealistic fight scenes are a pet peeve. The fights in &quot;Bourne&quot; are fast, nasty, and very realistic while still being entertaining for the layman. (And yes, taking a gun away from some idiot who is standing well within your striking radius without getting shot is definitely doable, though I had serious doubts until we tested it for ourselves with plastic dart guns in the dojo several years ago).\n\nWhile not being perfect, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is, simply put, several grades above the typical spy film. Being focused on an individual level rather than involving itself huge political ramifications lends it another layer of respectability rather than detracting from it as some comments have implied since it remains a human problem on a comprehensible scale. The mysteries that are left are bigger mysteries for Bourne than us, and I think should be viewed as intentional omissions rather than loose ends. The implausibilities are kept to a minimum and the realism to as high a level as possible while still being spectacular enough to meet the expectations of the genre.",

      "name": "Summer 2011: A season blessed with brilliant prequels",
      "reviewBody": "To begin on a tangent before evaluating the film, before summer 2011, I had not seen a decent prequel film. Prequels to films are often made when there is either a rich back story behind the originals or the producers are wanting a little more money from a particular franchise (see the Star Wars prequels). The problem they present is that film- makers have to construct their work, with the knowledge that the audience knows how it ends. One of the greatest things about seeing a film for the first time is the surprise and anticipation, to removing that can detract a lot from the overall impact of the film. But this summer I have had the pleasure of seeing X-men First Class, and now Rise of the Planet of the Apes - two excellent prequels to series that I didn&apos;t care for previously.\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes (RPA from now on, I can&apos;t bear typing it) is not only a triumph in CG animation, but as a stellar science fiction film, that remembers that films are infinitely more engaging when the audience actually cares for the characters on screen. Too often do I see films with a high premise that forget to flesh out their characters, leaving us to run around in mindless, weightless explosions with nobodies who we know less than 3 things about (cough, Transformers 3). Yes, RPA is about super intelligent apes that ransack cities and take on armed forces with little more than what surrounds them, but before we get to that there is an enormous amount of development from the main protagonist; Caesar. Although the advertisement trumpets James Franco, John Lithgow etc, the real star here is Andy Serkis, along with millions of dollars worth of CG animation to create the most expressive animated creatures on film. Even with Avatar, using real humans, pales in comparison to the amount of detail going into every single one of these apes; there is not one second in the film where you cannot understand one of the primates intentions - you could practically vocalise them yourself with the refined eye movement, body language that clearly separates Caesar from his more primitive relatives. Needless to say, Caesar&apos;s performance is flawless; after all this is the man who brought Gollum to life, but he captures the screen with an entirely wordless performance, which to me is the greatest part of the film. I felt for Caesar more than any other character in this film, and he did it without saying a word. Eat that Michael Bay. I was almost in tears at one point during one of Caesar&apos;s more emotional scenes for Christ Sake - although a chimp, the heightened intelligence really gives him just enough human characteristic to be above the uncanny valley while still behaving like an animal.\n\nThe humans in the film were what I considered weakest in this film; not any of the performances were bad, but a little more development in some minor characters and some tweak in the writing here and there would have made this a perfect 10. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) felt a bit off to me; he was cruel but almost in a cartoon way, though I suspect that&apos;s more to do with ill writing than any personal issues. The main cast are good, though at it&apos;s current length, I think more development with James Franco&apos;s character wouldn&apos;t have gone amiss, but then again, this might have thrown off the pacing.\n\nAnother thing I love about this film is that while taking a sharp diversion from its roots in terms of gradual characterisation, it does a superb job of delivering what everyone inevitably came for. A massive Chimpocalypse. A simian uprising that sees the downtrodden apes taking up arms against humanity, and in three words: it&apos;s f - ing cool. Made all the more exciting by the anticipation and the feel for these characters, the marvellous point about Caesar&apos;s character is that we sympathise with him, we understand why he leads an ape army AND WE SUPPORT HIM. A super intelligent ape is rallying a chimp attack force to free themselves from their confines, cause mayhem, disrupt order and ultimately rule humanity AND WE WANT THEM TO. And for that I applaud.\n\nI love a film that makes us look inwards at ourselves and question our own moral codes and attitudes to events in life (this one clearly representing a case of animal cruelty) that make us conclude that WE are indeed the bad guys, and we need to change. Living in a small, rural middle-class society (like myself) or a well-developed area often makes mainstream audiences forget about those less fortunate than themselves, and what it drives them to, or in this case, what having too much drives us to, and it&apos;s refreshing to see something that reminds us of how much of a plague we are to the rest of the planet.\n\nOverall, I would say a strong 9/10, perhaps not quite reaching the highs that First Class did, but by God, was it more consistent - definitely watch this one, and stay after the credits.",

      "reviewBody": "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit is one of my favorite television shows, even though its gone a bit downhill lately. Is it the cast? No, because they are mostly intact. What is actually happening is that each of the main characters, known for their superb chemistry amongst each other, are suddenly spending less screen time with each other and more time to themselves. This story actually has a point. On Stranger Tides suffers the same fate: fantastic cast that don&apos;t spend as much time with each other as we hope. Add some pointless plot lines, a calmer first-third of the flick, and you have yourself the fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nThat being said, its still quite entertaining. On Stranger Tides follows a variety of people searching for the fabled Fountain of Youth. Unfortunately for us, its not just Jack Sparrow. We have Blackbeard, the Spanish, the British (led by Barbossa), Angelica, and more doing the same thing. Subplots pertaining to this quest include Jack&apos;s past with Angelica, Barbossa&apos;s questionable change in character, some random guy falling for some random girl (I am serious, this part was totally pointless), and the pointless Spanish people that flock in and out of the movie.\n\nThis is by far the weakest part of the movie, the script. For some odd reason, they borrowed far too much from the novel (whose pacing and themes far differ that of the Pirates brand) and forgot that sometimes simplicity is best---which is what made Curse of the Black Pearl such a great film. It was the easiest to follow, and On Stranger Tides didn&apos;t learn from the previous two installments. To add to that, the script utterly separated everyone, even those with the best on-screen chemistry. Barbossa was barely with Jack Sparrow, Sparrow was rarely with his ex-lover, and worst of all reliable Gibbs spent minimal time with Sparrow. When they are together, the humor, the banter, tension, and the charm works well. When they aren&apos;t, well, the movie drags a bit.\n\nThank goodness the cast is still on their game. Johnny Depp once again breathes life into the pirate movie with his smart, unpredictable, and hilarious portrayal of Jack Sparrow. Despite what the reviews say, Jack Sparrow&apos;s shtick isn&apos;t getting old as he is still a delight to watch. Geoffrey Rush once again shines as Jack&apos;s best rival Barbossa, as his quiet intentions resemble that of Sparrow in earlier films. Penelope Cruz adds a layer of sexuality that we definitely did not have with the other Pirates of the Caribbeans--it&apos;s just a shame she didn&apos;t have much time with Sparrow. Director Rob Marshall was able to shell out good performances from everyone in the cast, but he definitely wasn&apos;t the man for this job.\n\nAlmost all the chase scenes or action sequences were done with very low-lighting and poor camera angles. With the exception of the mesmerizing and chilling mermaid sequence and the opening chase, all the action moments were missing that special touch. While the bizarreness of Gore Verbinski will not be totally missed (although his style worked perfectly in Rango), his ability to crank out excellent stuntwork and fights was sorely missing here. At least we got to see plenty of it, from the opening chase to the final dramatic (and short) showdown. Say whatever you want, but there has yet to be anything that can top the infamous three-way sword fight/old mill showdown from Dead Man&apos;s Chest.\n\nBottom Line: Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a mix of frustration and fun. There was plenty of potential that wasn&apos;t met because of questionable plot lines, pointless moments, lack of chemistry (once again: writer&apos;s fault. Good going Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio), and uneven direction. All that banter aside, Pirates is also plenty fun with several delightful moments, funny lines, and much more action than the last Pirates flick. Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and company keep the movie afloat, and prevent it from being a pure bore. But I think the franchise works better when Verbinski is behind the camera. On Stranger Tides is decent summer entertainment, but doesn&apos;t have the inescapable magic and charm of the first two.",

What is different about &quot;Zootropolis&quot; - called &quot;Zootopia&quot; in the USA - is that this is not one breed of talking animals existing in a human world, but every breed of animal inhabiting a world in which there are no humans. The colourful representation of this world, the engaging variety of characters, and the clever script with a message of tolerance and inclusion make for a wonderful movie from Walt Disney Productions.\n\nThe basic story is a kind of &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; pairing of two unlikely partners in crime- fighting: a female rabbit called Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) and a shady fox called Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). In pursuit of a missing person (sorry, animal), they encounter all sorts of adventures and a cast of characters ranging from sloths who will not be hurried to a Mr Big who turns out to be a tiny version of &quot;The Godfather&quot; concluding with a singing gazelle (Shakira). I took my five year old granddaughter to see the movie and she loved it, finishing up dancing in the aisles."

      "reviewBody": "There is so much pent-up rage over the handling of rape, and police behavior in general, that I think Frances McDormand&apos;s character in this film really struck a chord with people. She&apos;s on a crusade for her daughter who was raped and killed, and yet no progress has been made in the investigation. She doesn&apos;t care who she offends, she won&apos;t be intimidated into silence, and she&apos;ll stand up for herself in some violent ways. In an interesting twist, the police chief (Woody Harrelson) has pancreatic cancer, so aside from being called out on his investigation, he&apos;s dealing with that. The scene McDormand and Harrelson have in an interrogation room, and a specific moment of that is easily the film&apos;s best. Harrelson provides a voice of wisdom in the film, and the three letters he pens are also quite touching. There is humor as well, in just how boneheaded one of the policemen (Sam Rockewell) is, and the gem of a moment when Peter Dinklage, otherwise largely wasted, utters the line &quot;Penelope said &apos;begets&apos;?&quot;, in a subtle burn of the 19-year-old now dating McDormand&apos;s ex-husband.\n\nThe film started strong, but along the way started losing me. It suffers artistically from a lack of restraint, and everything seems exaggerated. The profanity. The characters, who start becoming cartoonish. The level of violence. The coincidences. It seems to me that McDonagh&apos;s writing is a real issue here. Her last words to her daughter were &quot;I hope you get raped,&quot; really? To leave that in the script is egregiously bad, and an insult to the viewer&apos;s intelligence. The Molotov cocktails, really? The guy being in the station to begin with, and of course wearing ear buds, really? A man thrown out of a window, and no arrest, really? And on and on, until an ending which is pretty awful if you think about it. It&apos;s just tough to appreciate the message of the film or its cast in light of all this. It was entertaining to watch, but in my humble opinion, not worthy of all the acclaim.",

Make sense...of course not but in a nutshell keep an open mind. Is it about war? Yes some of it is. It is about bonding and camaraderie? Yes of course, it highlights strained relationships in very stressful and violent situations. I enjoyed the movie and being ex military in the 3rd Armour Division you do tend to pick things out BUT I could do that in just about any military movie I have seen especially from WWII to date. Without being too specific I spotted armor and infantry tactical strategies which confused me a bit but other than that I did enjoy this movie. War is ugly and this movie does not miss that point.",

      "reviewBody": "The Perks of Being a Wallflower is another story about a simple guy living in a cruel life of high school. The difference is he&apos;s not ought to save the day, wants to lose his virginity, seeking to be popular, or revenge on his bullies. The story is about a shy kid who wants to get along with people and can&apos;t wait to leave high school. Behind it is the genuine pain and emotion of the characters which makes it more than just another story about teenagers. Stephen Chbosky tells his own story on screen pretty well and the performances are quite excellent. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is often heartbreaking, charming, and wonderful.\n\nCharlie is palpably just another teenage protagonist, but he is not one of those who tries to prove everyone who mistreated him wrong. His goal is to get away from being anti-social and be like anyone else in high school. We may have heard a story like this before, but what makes this one extraordinary is when it mostly depicts the darkest aspects of their lives. Expressing the most heartbreaking truths about these teenagers. Knowing their problems easily makes it reasonable for us to care about them. The romance is rather credibly lovely than a mainstream claptrap. In the joyous moments, it&apos;s pretty delightful and plays a quite nostalgic soundtrack.\n\nThe film gives the actors some nuance. This is probably a good thing for Logan Lerman. He usually plays the simple charming guy in movies. Since he&apos;s good at those, he adds some credibility to Charlie. Emma Watson is likable enough as Sam. The best among the three is Ezra Miller. One might hams it up for Patrick, but Miller gave the character a genuinely wonderful personality.\n\nThe director and author, Stephen Chbosky, didn&apos;t try anything else than to bring his book to life. He tells it straightforward on screen with plenty of strong, effective emotions. The cinematography is bright and beautiful enough. The tunnel scene has the best shots. While the soundtrack is too conspicuous, the music score is noticeably melancholic.\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower is best if you can actually relate to the lead character or have experienced the struggles of being an adolescent. When it&apos;s not depressing, the film goes to those blissful moments that make us remember the good times in high school. Overall, it&apos;s a great film. It&apos;s a film adaptation that replaces the cliché mainstream swagger with some painful realities and simply let the audience understand the whole point of it. In the end, it&apos;s quite a remarkable film.",

      "reviewBody": "John Smith and Jane Smith has the perfect marriage. Well, not quite so perfect. And they&apos;ve been keeping secrets from each other. They work for rival firms that do outsourcing work for the CIA. (Sadly, this would be better if viewers didn&apos;t know this for the first twenty minutes of the film, but the previews already gave it away.) \n\nBased on the preview, I thought this would be a Pitt-Jolie lovefest. I have enjoyed many of Pitt&apos;s films but not so many of Jolie&apos;s. And together, it was like a showcase of perfection for the American masses. Do I need to be reminded I&apos;ll never be handsome or rich? (Some will say movies help us escape this, and maybe it does, but still...) \n\nMy concerns were unfounded. This movie is well-acted, well-directed and well-written. The story is layered and brilliant, as well as quite funny. The direction fits well. The acting is superb, some of the best from Brad Pitt yet. And the explosions and gunfire and things breaking and high-tech gadgets? Very nice - someone put a lot into this film and/or has some natural talent I hope we see more of in Hollywood.\n\nI don&apos;t know if this film is PG-13 or R. I heard it was PG-13 because a sex scene was cut. Well, let me say: you should have kept the scene and kept the R. With all the excessive violence (really over the top) and the cussing, a little smut isn&apos;t going to make much difference. I mean, as an action film, I expect a solid R rating (look at Bruce Willis and &quot;Die Hard&quot; or &quot;Hostage&quot;).\n\nNo real complaints about this movie. I really want to say something bad, but I cannot. I was entertained the whole time and found the film very persuasively believable. I don&apos;t know who wrote or directed this (I guess I could check, but I didn&apos;t) but they just scored points in my book. Unless it was Michael Bay, but I&apos;m pretty sure he had nothing to do with this.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is - without a doubt - one of the most visually spectacular that I have ever seen, standing shoulder-to-shoulder in that department with the likes of Watchmen, Prometheus, Sunshine and Kosinski&apos;s preceding effort - TRON: Legacy. Also (like TRON) the soundtrack is excellent and very well used throughout, enhancing the action and adding depth to some - at times - distinctly average acting performances.\n\nTom Cruise plays Tom Cruise but that&apos;s not a bad thing in this case, in fact his natural charisma carries the movie through some of its slower sections. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman though he&apos;s really not on screen for long enough to influence the movie one way or another. Olga Kurylenko&apos;s statuesque profile is unfortunately not matched by her acting ability and I often found it difficult to believe in her character&apos;s actions and emotions. Andrea Riseborough turns in maybe the best performance, convincing as the sad and confused Victoria, unwilling - or perhaps unable - to confront the disturbing truth.\n\nAt over 2 hours I think that it&apos;s too long by about 20 minutes. A shorter cut would tighten up the story and eliminate some of the slower sections which I think hurt the movie&apos;s overall rhythm and flow.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend going to see this movie in the cinema, on the biggest screen that you can find. It just won&apos;t be the same on TV. The visual appeal alone is reason enough, but combined with a clever (if not entirely original) script, a thumping soundtrack and some exciting action, you should be entertained.",

This movie made me question my understanding of the same, whether it was an exodus or a genocide.\n\nThe film beautifully captures the mind of an Indian youth, conflicted between the two sides of stories being told to him. The conflict he goes through in choosing one side from the other, all at the same time uncovering the truth of his family&apos;s past tragedy.\n\nCourageous story telling at its best!\n\nThanks to the director Vivek Agnihotri, and the actors for delivering an epic movie experience on a sensitive topic.",

I love the background story of Spiderman shown in this movie, at least it has got one unlike the original. The story of how Peter Parker ended up with his Uncle and Aunt, the story of why &quot;Peter Parker&quot; is the only one who could be Spiderman and no-one else. It all feels complete now. A satisfactory plot for a superhero movie.\n\nTalking about the performances, I like the new Peter Parker, humorous and entertainer. I&apos;ve started to feel the original &apos;Peter Parker&apos; was actually boring. Really good job by the actors here. And with that SuperVillian : &apos;Electro&apos;, the movie becomes one of the best SuperHero movies. Visual effects are quite good and the movie is perfectly entertaining. For me, this is the best version of Spiderman movie till now. I don&apos;t care what the critics have to say, this movie is a good one.",

Hoffman gives an excellent portrayal of a man with autism, totally unable to comprehend the real world around him. Cruise is no less impressive. While he is essentially playing to type, his character&apos;s attitude changes so gradually throughout the film that you barely notice, and without Cruise&apos;s subtle performance this transformation would be much less credible.\n\nThis is a highly commendable film, which, despite tackling a tricky subject, refuses to succumb to sentimentality. In giving autism such publicity, the film has hopefully helped to lessen the stigma brought on by ignorance of this condition.\n\nRain Man&apos;s great success is that it shows the way forward for issue driven movies in Hollywood. Its success at the box office demonstrates that taking a risk can pay off in spades, provided that the film is good enough.",

Wow, what an idea, what creativity!\n\nViewing the behind-the-scenes on DVD disc 2, you can see the reasons for the incoherence of story and scenes - the huge fractured design team, numerous &apos;senior this&apos; &apos;senior that&apos;, all contributing to some corporate creation lacking any inspiration. Maybe the corporate cube-farm culture works for making cars, but it doesn&apos;t seem to work for films.\n\nI would have liked to have seen another level of reality exposed behind the mindless machines, and why are they so mindlessly evil when they can think up such a subtle ruse to enslave the humans? It isn&apos;t consistent. Why not introduce an alien ET culture who is really the master culture enslaving the machine culture by some similar hallucinatory ruse. Or, have the humans escape by transcending their bodies, as in all the traditional gnostic spiritualities.\n\nAll in all, the Matrix is just a retread of the movie TRON. TRON at least had some insight into what the machine mindset and motivation for domination might be, e.g. tyrannical game addiction, much like the decadent Roman emperors. The Matrix, after the first film, gives no thought to any subtle motivations of the machine culture, preferring the tired cliché of &apos;alien villain = mindless unrelenting violence&apos;."

If the movie universe was some sort of gigantic petting zoo, &quot;Juno&quot; would be the adorable little lamb standing in the corner making the jealous other lambs look like death incarnate. It&apos;s not a sugary sweet tale by any means, in fact it&apos;s a real down to earth kind of story that&apos;s not always pretty, but the approach to it couldn&apos;t be more right. It&apos;s humble, it&apos;s little, it&apos;s low-budget, and that&apos;s exactly what makes it so great. What I also liked about it, hell what I like about a lot of independent movies, is that it&apos;s never predictable. There is no formula, you don&apos;t know what&apos;s coming, you don&apos;t sit there quietly ticking of all the clichés: you just enjoy yourself tremendously. Finally, one last addition to the heap of praise and I swear I&apos;ll stop: it&apos;s been ages since I&apos;ve seen an ending scene this beautiful. It&apos;s exactly the way you want it to be, and the camera zooming out at a barely noticeable speed is a brilliant touch. I quite liked &quot;Juno&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "I must be one of the few, it seems, who enjoyed X-Men: The Last Stand. I have been an X-fan for many years and my expectations were still met by this film. Do I think that it could have been a bit better? Certainly. The script seemed to pack too many elements into a short running time. With those issues solved I believe that it would have been fantastic. Still, I felt that X-3 was almost on the level with X-2&apos;s greatness. It has taken another viewing and some time to reach this point. At first, I felt betrayed at the many liberties taken with story elements. But after I left the theatre, I could not shake the feeling that I needed to view it again. After the second time, I came to grips with the film and now like it quite a bit. \n\nContrary to some critics&apos; reviews, I do not believe that X-3 became overshadowed by action. There really is quite little of it until the finale, which feels quite epic. There are excellent character moments sprinkled throughout. The acting is generally superb across the board. More Ian McKellen is always nice, and Hugh Jackman impresses again with Wolverine. Kelsey Grammar actually does a respectable job with Beast. The other characters all do well with what they are given. There are a few poorly written one-liners that reminded me of the ones in X-Men 1, but the script is mostly intelligent with powerful themes such as the Cure. Another difficulty is that the film cannot pay the proper amount of attention to the many characters, including the new ones. But they still all seem to contribute something to the larger plot movement in the film. Ratner&apos;s only obvious difference from Singer is his frenetic pacing and energy. X-3 really moves quickly, and this does not have to be a negative. I also enjoyed the emotion that was hinted at in X-2, and came into full force during X-3. I do not think that it reached sentimentality or was melodramatic; it really felt powerful. The stakes really do seem to be high for the final chapter of this trilogy. The viewer finds this out quickly concerning Cyclops and Mystique, later with Jean and Xavier (in a particularly awe-inspiring scene), and during the finale in a nice moment with Jean and Wolverine. I think that many of the problems people are seeing in the film resulted from the pressure the entire production team was placed under in order to develop and finish the entire film in less than a year. \n\nBut all in all, I have really come to enjoy it as a satisfying film that met my high expectations. Look at it this way if you must. Try to see X-3 as not a stand-alone film but more as the third portion of one large story. The first X-Men had the difficult job of introducing a large ensemble cast of mutants and establishing a story and tone (other superhero films with one primary character have it much easier). X-2 had the most enviable position as most of the characters had already been partly developed and it did not have to conclude the entire story. It could work mostly on its own, just having to leave threads open for the next one. X-3 had the extremely difficult task of closing out the entire trilogy for good. I see it more as the third portion of one expansive tale, thus in the larger scheme it must move quickly toward a complete conclusion. In my opinion, the many actors under the abrupt switch in direction did an x-cellent job.",

But most of the material was stuff taken from the original only tweaked, and I hate to say it but I was actually bored for a good part of the movie. Some of the jokes/scenes dragged to long, to the point where I didn&apos;t find them funny anymore. There were some good moments, but the truly outrageous/original scenes that made the original so great were too few and far between. Some of the scenes were more outrageous in the sense that there was some full frontal nudity, but I&apos;m not someone who finds that super entertaining. Overall it felt to me like a re-hash of stuff that had already been done with some naked people thrown in, and it just wasn&apos;t enjoyable like the first movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie does come off as a bit shallow, and it contains characters who are one- dimensional caricatures of themselves. But guess what -- this movie is clearly in the romantic, holiday fantasy genre -- just like It&apos;s a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story are. And most people love those movies, so I don&apos;t get all the negative reviewing of this film. To me, this movie is clearly a fantasy piece, and as such it should not be subject to all the driveling negativity that would better be directed toward something terrible that masquerades as serious dramatic work. Would the British PM ever go knocking door to door with just one bodyguard? No Way! Do Londoners actually care what song is &quot;number one for Christmas&quot; more than Americans do?? (I&apos;m seriously doubting it -- who other than a few teenagers and record promoters actually cares about charts?) This is clearly a work that&apos;s not to be taken as a &quot;serious&quot; movie, though it&apos;s seriously fun if you&apos;ll take it for the fantasy that it is. \n\nI love this film. Despite the clearly fantastic story lines, I like the characters, and the amazing A-list cast does a great job. I caught it first in theatrical release, then I watched it three times back to back on a plane to London because the other choices were the abysmal &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; and &quot;Duplex.&quot; Since I&apos;ve caught it on HBO, and I&apos;ve quickly realized it&apos;s one of those movies you can watch repeatedly when flipping channels for a quick &quot;pick me up&quot; that only fantasy movies can provide. My favorite movie of that sort is Groundhog Day, if that clues you into my argument. \n\nThe multi-threaded storytelling in this borrows from the likes of Magnolia, and the fact that it&apos;s a light hearted holiday theme flick place that device in interesting contrast. \n\nI see Love Actually as a new holiday classic."

      "reviewBody": "The first X-Men film was fun and well-made though with a beginning-of-the-franchise-not-yet-properly-finding-its-feet feel; X-Men 2 was very, very good indeed and an example of a bigger and darker sequel better than the original(even if it wasn&apos;t quite perfect either) and X-Men 3 The Last Stand while nowhere near as bad as its reputation was disappointing(after being so impressed by the previous two) and a step-back in the franchise. X-Men Origins: Wolverine had much going for it but while it is nowhere near a bad film it could have delivered more, considering that this was an origins prequel story. X-Men Origins: Wolverine does have good things, it&apos;s well shot and edited(if a little rapid in a couple of the fighting sequences), the special effects are nicely executed and not used too much and the dark, gritty style of the previous three films is wisely maintained, nothing overblown or static here. The opening sequence is robust and exciting and gives you the sense of &quot;looks like we&apos;re in for a treat here&quot;, most of the action sequences have tension and thrills especially at the end(which also makes a real effort to tie up loose ends), Sabretooth/Victor and Stryker are well-realised and there are a few good performances. Wolverine may be too ambivalent character-development-wise but Hugh Jackman&apos;s charisma and grizzled demeanour is pitched perfectly, Liev Schreiber brings real meat, toughness and menace to Victor/Sabretooth and Danny Huston as the villain Stryker is both classy and ruthless and does them very effectively, Stryker avoids being too one-dimensional. Ryan Reynolds and Taylor Kitsch do what they can and are quite good. \n\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine does suffer however from a lot of the same things that X-Men The Last Stand had. The script is very contrived and in a worse way than X-Men The Last Stand, emotional moments are forced, exposition and any explanations are underdeveloped and any bits of humour are on the broad side(X-Men 2 especially avoided this and had a much more even balance). The story has some good atmosphere and good scenes and has some tension, but it does try to cram in too much and things feel rushed and not as developed as they ought. Gavin Hood does reasonably admirably in the action but very like Brett Ratner he is surprisingly not as comfortable in the non-action scenes, in a way that the writing and story, that should give the film depth, are sacrificed by the action(again mostly very good, apart from ones that did lag and you couldn&apos;t always tell who was who). Apart from Sabretooth and Stryker (Wolverine was written much better in the first two films but Jackman&apos;s presence did make up for things), the characters are disappointingly written, especially Deadpool who had a lot of potential but disappears just like that and appears even more abruptly much later at a stage where you think they&apos;ve forgotten all about him. Gambit was also treated fairly insignificantly, and other characters like Blob and Kayla(Lynn Collins&apos; acting is wooden in this part) are pretty useless. It doesn&apos;t have the too many characters problem like The Last Stand did but it like that film doesn&apos;t develop or write the characters well but not as insultingly. On a side note one positive review said that they couldn&apos;t understand why The Last Stand and this got criticised for the characters and the first two get a free pass; actually the first two films have been criticised for under-utilising characters and bad acting in them, namely Cyclops and Storm, but at least they tried to respect the characters and not distort them or deprive them of personality like this and Last Stand did(and this is NOT coming from a comic-book purist, far from it, you don&apos;t even need to have read an X-Men comic to have this criticism). Harry Gregson-Williams&apos; score has some excitement and induces some suspense but at other points it&apos;s too over-bearing and strident, of the X-Men films this film had the least effective score in my opinion. Will.i.Am being cast in an X-Men film would cause alarm bells and his performance is not any better, it felt out of place. \n\nTo conclude, could have been better but it&apos;s not that bad. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "If Tim Burton&apos;s out there I just want to thank him for bringing the spirit of the book&apos;s original illustrations to the screen. He even matched the facial expressions to the drawings, especially in the case of Charlie&apos;s family. Charlie himself looks like one of the drawings, and the Bucket house is so much like the illustrations it caused me to realize that Burton is as visual as any movie director can be. (Recent editions feature the work of a different illustrator. I&apos;m talking about the illustrations from the 1960s. The difference between the older illustrations and the newer ones is the older ones feature a lot of cross-hatching. I imagine the older illustrations are still available, especially in a hardcover, but you&apos;ll need to search the net.) I don&apos;t know how he did it, but he got the facial expressions of Charlie&apos;s family and of Mike Teavea&apos;s father down perfectly. He also absorbed Dahl&apos;s sense of humor. The opening fifteen minutes or so, in which the winners of the golden tickets are announced one by one, really get Roald Dahl&apos;s sense of the ridiculous. I think Burton&apos;s addition of Wonka&apos;s childhood story fits well, although I&apos;ll agree that the way this is resolved is not completely in Dahl&apos;s spirit. Even in the resolution, however, Burton maintains sly humor. It is well-acted by everybody. I&apos;d like to say that Julia Winter, who plays Veruca Salt, has turned in a truly well-observed comedic performance. Depp converts the novel&apos;s jaunty, precise Wonka into a quirky one, but it works well, because, as in the novel, Wonka&apos;s endearing traits contrast with the fact that he&apos;s a tyrant. Roald Dahl gets a rap for his cynicism, and this movie softens his message a bit. Dahl is a bit like Orwell. Both of them point out that man, given power, will exploit his fellow human beings. CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY the movie is not quite as dark as the book. But it comes very, very close.",

      "reviewBody": "Some people say Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom is the worst movie of the franchise so far. To me, the worst is basically Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull. This movie is not perfect, but it&apos;s still good.\n\nSet before the events of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Indiana Jones is tasked by a village to help them after he escapes a Triad group after a deal gone wrong. Joined by singer Willie and young sidekick Short Round, Indy goes to Pankot Palace, where he discovers a hidden temple where a Thuggee cult, led by Mola Ram, has the stones the village asked him to return, and has even enslaved the kids of said village to mine for the last two.\n\nYeah, this movie is very violent, as it has some scenes that at the time, would be so brutal, some parents complained the movie should have been rated R. This, alongside the outrage of how violent first Gremlins movie was, would influence Steven Spielberg, who was involved with both movies, to suggest the PG-13 rating as an in-between rating. Also, the film is controversial for how it portrayed the country of India, causing the film to be banned from the country temporarily.\n\nDespite those controversies, the film is interesting. It has the same exciting action as the first movie (like the famous mine cart chase scene), and even some goofy moments, making Temple of Doom one of my favorite films.",

The realism was there, Bradley Cooper was phenomenal, the angst of a soldier during battle was portrayed brilliantly, the decisions we ask kids to make are real and they were realistically shown on screen, and as this film makes clear--war isn&apos;t a walk in the park. Anybody who thinks Bradley Cooper is a flash in the pan is sadly mistaken; this guy is the real thing. Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now, Charlie Sheen in Platoon, and now Bradley Cooper in American Sniper. You&apos;ve got to go all the way back to Gregory Peck in Pork Chop Hill or George C. Scott in Patton to get even close to an actor that gave a better performance in this genre. I saw it twice. Couldn&apos;t get through it the first time and had to walk out- -I got so damned furious at George Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld for murdering all these innocent kids I couldn&apos;t watch anymore.

I wonder how astounding and exquisite the experience would be to watch such contents in 4D!\n\nThe movie&apos;s inception with a gripping prison break set the tone for a non-stop thrill ride considering we get an idea this is something big. The exhilarating momentum reached its zenith during the iconic Burj Khalifa scene which was marvelously shot! It&apos;s still one of the greatest scenes in the world of Cinema!\n\nTom Cruise&apos;s brilliance and the surreal work on the Burj, including the elevator sequence, left me in awe. Simon Pegg&apos;s resourcefulness and humor in action movies added a delightful charm.\n\nThe film&apos;s action and adventure never failed to entertain ensuring there was never a dull moment. The thrill remains intact, making it a delightful re-watch. I eagerly await more MI movies, hoping to watch one in 4D!",

      "reviewBody": "This review of John Wick: Chapter 2 is spoiler free\n\n**** (4/5)\n\nTHERE HAVE BEEN a lot of roles that Keanu Reeves has played since hanging up his sunglasses, long leather coat and his boots after 2003s The Matrix: Revolutions. Many of which were promisingly good, some were quite bad and others in-between were mediocre to say the least. But out of all these characters he&apos;s been in none that have fit him more like a glove than the title character in 2014s John Wick, the hirsute assassin who was enjoying life in retirement with his new puppy, until he had to get revenge etc. The film spawned a whole new genre of action: the geriaction thriller (cheekily, Reeves was just about to turn 50 at the time he couldn&apos;t be considered as a geriatric) because at the time there were a few other films with older protagonists sharing the multiplex, such as Denzel Washington in The Equalizer, Kevin Costner in 3 Days to Kill and the granddaddy of them all Liam Neeson in Taken 3. \n\nEven though he was a lot older than he was in the first Matrix he did a bloody (emphasis high on bloody) good job at ass-kicking, or sharp shooting criminals out of his home. He ended up killing a lot of people, there was a lot of action to enjoy. At this point you may be asking yourself what&apos;s on offer the second time-round? From the start of John Wick: Chapter 2 there is a lot to take in we are immediately transferred into a car chase it&apos;s indeed the main improvement over its predecessor which didn&apos;t have much of a story, there was just a lot of action a huge body count and a lot of blood a simple dog revenge thriller. For a while through this it riffs the same thing, there is a lot of action, a lot of blood and a huge body count – there are, however, two differences, an entirely new plot which riffs on an entirely new revenge story this time it&apos;s Wick&apos;s life on the line after he entered in a wager with a ruthless killer (Riccardo Scamarcio) and the dog (a Staffie with no name). \n\nThe title Chapter 2, also indicates there will be a larger series to behold here seemingly perhaps he may come back for the third movie (if it happens) we&apos;ll see. Director Chad Stahelski&apos;s material here is - in one word spectacular there is plenty here to enjoy, it&apos;s one of those movies that if it&apos;s done well then you&apos;ll enjoy it, now on the second-time-round the message is certainly correct. The action throughout is cool, the car chases are ruthlessly fun, and finally it&apos;s completely on edge from start to finish and with Reeves on top form what&apos;s not to like for this second time? Kicking off just a few hours after the ending of John Wick our protagonist (Reeves) is bruised, bloodied and quite frankly fatigued after fighting for hours on end. \n\nHe&apos;s tied in with another plot for revenge with a killer and his duo of assassins (Common, Ruby Rose); he receives info from his trusted hotel manager (McShane) that he is under attack. He must end a wager, to do this he has to fight for his life in a bullet ballet rampage; he must kill someone to somewhat end it, Wick here uses his skills and his wits through this barrage of bullets in the catacombs. Here there is an entertaining montage when he gears up for – perhaps his biggest battle, containing a brilliant cameo from Peter Serafinowicz who helps gear up Wick with an arsenal of weapons, along with his bullet-proof suit. There is also a knife fight on train slightly hinting at The Raid 2. Perhaps this is the message Stahelski is sending to us that he can make a bloody action thriller with a lot of enjoyable moments. \n\nWick then joins forces with the homeless network run by Laurence Fishburne&apos;s Bowery King, though instead of showing down to a Matrix-fu brawl, Bowery gives him a favour for saving his life many years before there is even a chance to his maniacal laugh, and for him to prove he&apos;s smarter again by riffing famous lines. This is when the film becomes slightly rubbery it loses its footing slightly, as it drags out a bit more. But when the action unfolds again it&apos;s immediately back to its home.\n\nStahelski&apos;s style isn&apos;t limited or indeed of short-supply because there is plenty here to enjoy it&apos;s completely ruthless from the opening moments to the stunning Hall of Mirrors set-piece there is a lot of action for any action movie buff to enjoy. Reeves may not be the greatest actor of our generation, nor, indeed is he the worst but he hits every mark with clarity throughout he&apos;s brilliant when it comes to the action. Despite the elasticised third act, as the story takes a while to step in. John Wick: Chapter 2 is slightly better than its predecessor it&apos;s an adrenaline-fuelled, action-packed ride with a lot of bodies, blood, plenty of material and is downright good fun from start to finish, it&apos;s an absolute blast. \n\nVERDICT: A bruisingly, brilliant action-packed bullet ballet of a sequel. This is an absolute bloody blast and with Reeves on top form, what&apos;s not to love?",

Because of this, Edward has big scissors instead of fingers and a strange looking, almost industrial. But he ends up being found amid the ruins of the mansion where he was born and taken to a suburban neighborhood, where life is always the same, made of perfection appearances. Directed by Tim Burton, has a screenplay by Caroline Thompson and counts on the participation of Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder.\n\nThis film is a modern Christmas tale and, for a decade, was very broadcast on televisions around this time of year. The story is very beautiful and touching, and makes us think about issues such as the right to be different from others, the difference between being and seeming, the exaggerated importance we give to appearances and the little importance we give to what is genuine, and how our society corrupts what is naturally good (Rousseau revisited?). Despite it usually have a parental rating accessible to children, this film seems to have been designed for public since the age of ten. The cast is reasonable but not surprising, except for Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, actors who had, in this movie, the first major opportunity to shine, and where Depp inaugurated a long and fruitful partnership with Burton, which lasts until today. The photography and the visual effects are very good. The sets and costumes are interesting, helping to get the message proposed in the film, and the soundtrack is marked by the main theme, composed by Danny Elfman. This piece remained in the memory of the audience for its beauty and magic, becoming one of the most beautiful musical pieces made for film.",

      "name": "An underrated part of MCU history",
      "reviewBody": "As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.\n\nHowever, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn&apos;t considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn&apos;t very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn&apos;t even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.\n\nFor one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).\n\nThe performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn&apos;t stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.\n\nThe story itself isn&apos;t very remarkable. It&apos;s fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it&apos;s more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We&apos;ve seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn&apos;t just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that&apos;s the case, then it&apos;s a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn&apos;t a moment where I didn&apos;t believe that these two characters were completely in love.\n\nWhat this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It&apos;s true that it&apos;s mainly Banner&apos;s story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn&apos;t as modern as what we&apos;re used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it&apos;s even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it&apos;s really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.\n\nThis movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you&apos;re taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you&apos;re only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don&apos;t skip the Incredible Hulk.",

In a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was not a sound so I know the children all liked it. There parents also seemed engaged. The death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments. Hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids. As such, it was successful although I liked it too. Personally I liked the Scrat!!",

However, my daughter insisted that I watch &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; and I was feeling absolutely horrible when I watched the film, as I had just gone through some painful surgery that morning. So, to take my mind off my aches, I gave it a try. And, thankfully, it turned out to be exactly the sort of tonic I needed--entertaining and crazy fun. While I didn&apos;t see it in the theater (the best way to see this type of movie), I did see it on a very large screen at home and watching it on a small screen is practically a waste of time. For once, I loved that a film has eye- popping visuals, explosions and action--and it manages to deliver an entertaining experience without leaving you feeling dumb for having enjoyed it--a problem too often associated with movie of this style. Well worth your time.",

      "reviewBody": "James Cameron does it again. Creates a beautiful, vibrant world with a basic, paint by numbers plot. If someone had stepped in and cut this movie an hour shorter, we might have been okay but instead I was getting bored, checked my watch and saw I still had 45 minutes to go.\n\nIs the world beautiful? Yes, absolutely. Does the adjusted frame rate work? No, action scenes feel like a cut scene from a video game. How&apos;s the story? Mediocre. The overarching story gets lost and forgotten because James Cameron wants to paint the whole world. As he does that, he fills it in with random cliché side plots to distract you until you remember, oh yeah, there&apos;s a big bad villain out there. The story feels like something my 6 year old niece would write. Bouncing from one thought to the next.\n\nRough synopsis: Oh the *Insert character/Group* is in trouble! Lets go save them. How could you do that? You know better. Here&apos;s a beautiful CGI thing to look at. Rinse/repeat.\n\nMajor themes carry over from the first one. Humanity is bad except for &quot;our&quot; white savior. He&apos;s the good guy. Here&apos;s a new group of Navi that don&apos;t trust us at first but they&apos;ll come around after a scary moment.\n\nThe story feels like Cameron kept adding on one story trope after another and no one walked into the room to knock the pen out of his hand. If you end up watching it, do yourself a favor and get up to pee halfway through. Grab some popcorn and a drink. Maybe taking a break from Pandora will make it not so insufferably long.",

      "reviewBody": "For a film that is budgeted at merely 34 million dollars, this film visually looks really good. For comparison, Fantastic Four had a budget of 120 million and the effects and so called &apos;set pieces&apos; were awful. This is one of the biggest problems with Hollywood, but that&apos;s a discussion for another day. The Maze Runner is actually a surprisingly entertaining movie. For an age in which the medium is flooded with young adult novels and movies, the film feels fresh and isn&apos;t overwhelmed by clichés like so many others are.\n\nIt&apos;s led by a relatively unknown cast. Dylan O&apos;Brien, from Teen Wolf fame, is thrown into a maze structure along with a few dozen other young men who soon find there is more to the maze than they were led to believe. Let me be the first to say I think O&apos;Brien has some chops and definitely has a future in this business. The role doesn&apos;t require a ton of range, but I think he proved he can lead a huge action film, and not many actors can say that. The writing itself I thought could have been a little smarter and more mature. Will Poulter, who played a much different character in We&apos;re The Millers, was solid in the role that was given to him. But the writing had him doing some really stupid things and was full of forced dialogue I felt.\n\nWith that being said, the mythology behind the story is pretty interesting. And they made the film into a more traditional monster film than I&apos;m sure the book originally called for, but it really works. The horror element to the film was by far the most intriguing, and had the biggest payoff. The &apos;Greavers&apos; also proved to be pretty terrifying, something I didn&apos;t think I would say about a film with a bunch of teenagers. So I really only watched this because I&apos;m probably going to see the sequel this weekend, and i ended up enjoying the movie. Plus, having Littlefinger as the next villain gets me pretty excited.\n\n+Monster flick\n\n+Surprisingly well acted\n\n+Suspensful\n\n-Some stupid dialogue\n\n7.2/10",

There is a &quot;Lost Highway&quot; feel to it and the themes are closely related but...The Butterfly effect is in fact more complex.It is a really disturbing movie, not so much for what it shows, but for what it keeps you guessing - like all true thriller masterpieces - , about events that take or might take place, and above all, about human sanity and the subtle twist there is between the average Joe&apos;s walk of life and outright perversion.

I can&apos;t recommend it highly enough for F1 fans like me, sports fans, or anyone interested in a story of rivalry i.e. something different to the unoriginal junk movies which get churned out each year.\n\nAll the crew involved should pat themselves on the back. They&apos;ve done a fabulous job making this film critique, explore and honour two memorable F1 drivers.\n\nJames Hunt&apos;s fun, party lifestyle along with his brash and raw driving talent. This is contrasted against Niki Lauda&apos;s methodical thinking, technical brilliance and professional lifestyle. These two characters are total opposites but as their lives are explored it also acknowledges the value of an enemy, i.e. something to beat. I believe this is a commentary on human nature in that the best of us shines when we have something to beat or overcome.\n\nDo yourself a favour and see it now.",

Antonio Bandares as the cat was just such a great addition to the cast, he just killed me! I don&apos;t understand why Shrek 2 wasn&apos;t on the top 250, how could someone not enjoy this Shrek? \n\nShrek and Fiona are now married and happy ogres, that is until Fiona&apos;s parents wish to see her and her new hubby. Fiona was supposed to marry Prince Charming, which ruined her fairy godmother and dad&apos;s plans, so her dad hires a hit-cat to slay Shrek, but fails, but since Shrek spars his life, the cat stays with Donkey and Shrek. Shrek wants so badly for Fiona to live happily ever after, so he and Donkey take a potion from the fairy godmother and have little time to make sure it stays permanent.\n\nLike I said, the Cat was my favorite character, especially when he and Donkey since Livin&apos; La Vida Loca, I thought that it was so cute. Also when he stops the guards in the palace and gives them the cute kitty look. I just don&apos;t understand why no one got into the sequel as much as I did, otherwise this would be higher on the rating, and probably above the first Shrek.\n\n10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Honestly, I didn&apos;t have very high expectations for &apos;Big Hero 6&apos;, considering that I&apos;m usually not a fan of Marvel&apos;s works, but I was gladly proved wrong.\n\nStory wise, &apos;Big Hero 6&apos; is rather formulaic and not too outstanding, but it&apos;s still very entertaining due to the way it balances all aspects. You have everything: drama that&apos;s not over the top but still touching, thrilling action, great comedy, and some okay twists. And more importantly, they all mix together perfectly, so you&apos;ll never get bored or frustrated, and at the same time, you will feel connected with the characters as they deal with some mature conflicts rarely seen in recent Disney products. A huge part of this accomplishment is thanks to the character Baymax. The guy is amazingly likable, steals every scene he&apos;s in, and has great contributions to every part of the movie. When the movie needs drama, he provides the sensitivity and cuteness, when it needs action, he&apos;s the coolest, and when it needs comedy, he&apos;s the funniest. His voice acting by Scott Adsit is also great as he sounds both emotional and cute, despite the robotic voice effects.\n\nThe rest of the characters, however, are hit and miss. Hiro is cool, and I like the way he deals with grief: quite mature and not excessive, though his voice doesn&apos;t sound like a 14-year-old. The other two boys in the group are okay because they tend to break away from stereotypes. But the others, including the main villains, are just cliché and forgettable.\n\nVisually, &apos;Big Hero 6&apos; is very stunning, mainly due to the lively San Fransokyo and the impressive effects. Personally, I find some of the action scenes in this to be the most cinematic and thrilling I&apos;ve ever seen in animation. All of the camera movements, slow-motions, and lighting and explosion effects easily rival the best live-action blockbusters out there. Moreover, the characters&apos; visual designs are also more imaginative than other recent Disney products&apos;. This is especially true for Baymax, who is surprisingly expressive despite the minimalistic looks. \n\n&apos;Big Hero 6&apos; is no masterpiece, and it may not be up to the standards of Pixar&apos;s classics or Dreamworks&apos; &apos;How to Train Your Dragon&apos;, but nonetheless, it&apos;s still a greatly entertaining and well-made movie. I also love that it still leaves a lot open for the sequels as I now really look forward to them.",

      "reviewBody": "Matthew McConaughey is barely recognizable as Ron Woodroof, an electrician/womanizer who ends up finding out he&apos;s contracted HIV/AIDS and has 30 days left to live. After searching deeper for information on a relatively unknown disease (at the time), he finds out that there is existing medication that is not yet approved in the U.S.A. that could help him survive longer.\n\nHowever, after running into red tape when trying to obtain medication, he decides to smuggle massive amounts of pharmaceutical products and starts selling them to other HIV/AIDS infected patients, creating the &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot;.\n\nFirst of all, what a film. Jean-Marc Vallée&apos;s &quot;C.R.A.Z.Y.&quot; was quite something to watch, but &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot; is a tremendous achievement. Vallée&apos;s directing is stellar, the script is top notch, and features a palette of characters that makes this story truly engaging and human.\n\nHomophobia, illness, lust, being incapable of receiving proper treatment, smuggling, death, friendship, the limitations of the legal system, these are all themes that would lead one to think that this film is a depressing drama. It is not. And that&apos;s where the success of &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot; lies. All these themes would make the perfect recipe for a melodrama, wrap it up in a small package with a big star (McConaughey), and put the &quot;Based on a true Story&quot; stamp. But it&apos;s so much, much more.\n\n&quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot; avoids all the traps of melodrama by being whole-heartedly hilarious at times, with just the proper dose of raw emotion, and performances that will be remembered for ages. Half-way through the film, my friends and I looked at each other, in a bit of disbelief, unanimously agreeing that McConaughey deserves an Oscar for this. Jared Leto is also wonderful as Rayon, an AIDS-infected transvestite patient that will become a great friend and business partner, and that will trigger Woodroof&apos;s change of vision towards homosexuality. And it is not drastic. It comes in all kinds of subtleties and heart-warming moments. Hats off to Jennifer Garner as well, she is flawless.\n\nWithout ever offering a heavy-hearted tone, this is a story of perseverance and positivity with an interesting setting that sheds some light on an often forgotten page of history. Engaging social drama, well-written comedy, and wonderful cinematic experience altogether.",

      "reviewBody": "Top Gun is undoubtedly one of my favourite films, and one of those that has the ability to keep enthralling you even while watching for the tenth time. Director Tony Scott was chosen after the producers saw his work in advertising, and true to their judgement he has produced a visual masterpiece. It looks simply gorgeous, and the live action sequences have never been bettered. If there is one flaw in the film it is that it is somewhat shallow, with all of the people behind the film (and Tom Cruise) rather better at making visual spectaculars than an engaging story. However the story does work well in drawing you into the world of Maverick and his fellow naval aviators, Cruise forms an excellent rapport with Anthony Edwards as Goose, and the dialogue is snappy and eminently quotable. Everyone has at some stage used Maverick&apos;s line - &quot;I couls tell you, but then I&apos;d have to kill you&quot;, and the cover of the Righteous Brothers is unforgettable. The film is backed by one of the best soundtracks of the decade, and a very strong supporting cast. In my opinion, the film succeeds in everything it sets out to achieve. A cracking script, a gripping story, and simply stunning aerial photography. You have to see this film."

      "reviewBody": "We&apos;ve waited so long for this moment, and it was beyond fun, wholesome, full of surprises, emotional and epic! Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.\n\nIt&apos;s beyond the MCU timeline, it&apos;s beyond even FOX&apos;s &quot;X-Men&quot; movies. It&apos;s about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.\n\nYou know it&apos;s going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it&apos;s Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.\n\nWhat about the cameos, you&apos;d ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there&apos;s a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.\n\nEmma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.\n\nThe action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!\n\nThe music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!\n\nCan&apos;t praise the movie enough, but &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can&apos;t possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you&apos;ll go again and again... and again.\n\nWhat about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don&apos;t want to say anything about it because I don&apos;t want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful. It&apos;s nowhere near &quot;fun filler&quot;, it&apos;s not &quot;Infinity War&quot; level too, but it&apos;s a great movie, and it&apos;s one of MCU&apos;s finest!",

      "reviewBody": "I think The Fifth Element is the movie I have seen the most... It is a perfect mixture of action and comedy, science-fiction, suspense and romance. Set in a not so far future, the eternal battle between good and evil is shown to us in an extravagant setting. Flying cars, aeroplanes that go at the speed of light, weird creatures and ugly aliens are only a few things that are present during this film. The story has never been seen before : Good has only one weapon to defeat evil; it is composed of four stones representing the four element (water, earth, fire and air) and a perfect creature. These five elements have to be united before the forces of evil arrive to earth. But evil has found help and the stones have disappeared. Bruce Willis (one of the best action actors of our time), Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm and Gary Oldman make the suspense even more intense. Chris Tucker is incredibly funny and ads a lot to the comic side of the film. The story is extremely imaginative and is, in my opinion, one of Luc Besson&apos;s best. I have never seen anything else like it. The costumes, designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, are unbelievably imaginative and fun. They are a big part of the extravagance and originality of the movie. The score, by Eric Serra (one of my favourites) is simply a work of art. And last but not least, the special effects are absolutely excellent, adding to the quality of the movie. If you are looking for action and a good laugh, this is the film to see. But the actors are not the only things that make this film worth seeing. Click here",

It does get going, but later on, it&apos;s all build up for the second.\n\nThe visuals are great, there are plenty of action sequences and explosions, and of course sets and costumes look great. Lawrence is very good once again, but the script doesn&apos;t offer her the range that Catching Fire did.\n\nJulianne Moore was excellent as President Coin I thought, very strong performance.\n\nI did enjoy that scene where Peeta turned, having been absent for most of the movie, it was good to see him put to good use.\n\nI liked that there was a message at the end for Philip Seymour Hoffman, RIP.\n\n6/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Hancock (2008) is a movie I recently watched on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows an anti-super hero that often causes as much damage as good during his times of heroism. One day, when saving a struggling public relations expert, he gets the advice he needs. Hancock will partner with the PR guy to try and save his image while continuing to do good for mankind. This movie is directed by Peter Berg (The Rundown) and stars Will Smith (Men in Black), Charlize Theron (Monster) and Jason Bateman (Ozark). The storyline for this is fairly clever and well done. The cast is very well selected and Smith, Theron and Bateman all deliver their characters perfectly. The script and dialogue is very good, loved the head in the ass references throughout. The soundtrack is also very good. There are some great action scenes that insert the comedic content very well. This isn&apos;t a great picture but it is clever and entertaining in a lot of ways. I recommend seeing it at least once and would score it a 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I admit walking into the theater, I was very excited but also a little apprehensive. I should not have worried at all though, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was incredibly enjoyable! Rowling&apos;s magical world is as alluring and fun as ever! For me, the best thing about this movie is exactly that. Exploring this world.\n\nIn the Harry Potter saga, with the exception of Deathly Hallows, most of the action was confined in Hogwarts. When we were taken out of the school, the main characters, being underage, were not allowed to do magic. The novelty in this movie is that we get to follow a fully fledged adult wizard in an entirely new environment and observe the dynamics and workings of the magical society.\n\nSaid wizard is Newt Scamander, a magical zoologist that traveled the world in order to find and document rare creatures, which he carries in his magical suitcase. When this suitcase gets mixed up with one that belongs to muggle Jacob, some of Newt&apos;s creatures escape and cause problems in New York.\n\nEddie Redmayne shines in this movie. He plays a very clearly British, endearing and slightly awkward Newt, but the character&apos;s kindness is obvious by the loving and friendly way that he treats his magical creatures. Dan Fogler does a great job as Jacob Kowalski, the muggle who is suddenly thrown into a world of wonder that existed beside him all along. He is the one the audience can best relate to, since he mirrors our sense of marvel. Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sudol also do a good job as the two vastly different magical sisters, who aid Newt in his adventure. If I had a small gripe, it would be that the excellent Colin Farell was in my opinion under used.\n\nAll in all, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a solid and visually stunning movie that manages to achieve three things.\n\nFirst, although it takes place in the Harry Potter universe, it stands apart and has its very own story, which can be enjoyed separately from that of the famous young wizard. Second, it drops quite a few hints and names, which not only tie in nicely with the stories that we know, but also serve to set up the next installments, which are rumored to document Dumbledore&apos;s past and connection with Grindelwald. Finally, the movie features a bustling 1926 New York, which coupled with the intriguing character dynamics, offers a brand new insight into Rowling magical world and leaves us poor muggles asking for more.\n\nAfter following Harry&apos;s adventures, many of us were left wanting to see much more of the story and luckily for us, it seems Rowling has that much more to offer. Personally, I can&apos;t wait for the next movie, great job!",

There is enough silliness, adventure, and romance to allow boys and girls of almost all ages to love this show. There were some funny lines in the show that kids would not understand, but adults would enjoy. I heard a gentleman laughing throughout the whole show. I am not around teenagers, so I am not sure how a teenager would respond to this show. The storyline was different but predictable. That should not discourage anyone from going to this show.

Spielberg doesn&apos;t have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn&apos;t spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who&apos;ve never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren&apos;t vibing on the connection, the car doesn&apos;t need explaining. It&apos;s just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That&apos;s why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.\n\nThe thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They&apos;re all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish. \n\nThe story&apos;s breakneck speed, it&apos;s never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Harry Knowles once wrote a review of Das Boot that said the movie was so well made that you&apos;d find yourself rooting for Nazi sailors trying to sink American ships. So here. You find yourself rooting for clever &quot;outsiders and weirdos,&quot; as one of them puts it, who saw what nobody else wanted to see -- that an immense structure of mortgage based securities was doomed to collapse because it rested on the backs of subprime borrowers who couldn&apos;t support the weight and should never have been loaned the money. We have been taught by generations of fiction to identify with characters who are outsiders and rebels. Because these guys are smart, because they are antisocial and because they were laughed at by smug fools who believed the conventional wisdom, you identify with them, and you wait anxiously for their vindication. Then you realize that their vindication means the collapse of the American economy. They were the guys on the Titanic who knew what the iceberg meant and booked reserved seats in the lifeboats.\n\nMichael Lewis, from whose book the movie was adapted, got his training at Salomon Brothers in the mid-80s, as mortgage based securities were being invented. (There&apos;s an early shout-out to Lew Ranieri, the Salomon trader who invented them.) As anyone knows who&apos;s read Lewis&apos;s memoir of those days, Liar&apos;s Poker, the culture at Salomon was that your job was to be smarter than everybody else in the bond market, understand values better, and know what other traders were going to do before they knew it themselves. If you were smart enough, you deserved whatever you took away from somebody less smart on the other side of the trade. That&apos;s why Lewis admires his protagonists and that, despite a thick coating of moral outrage, is the heart of the movie. The guys who shorted the housing market weren&apos;t any more virtuous or less greedy than the great majority of complacent, conventionally minded bankers who believed that the trees would keep growing all the way up to the sky. They just saw more clearly and had plenty of nerve and faith in their own judgment. If they had been wrong, as shorts often are, they and their clients would have been wiped out. When they turned out right, they took the money and kept it, even if some of them felt guilty about it.\n\nI know somewhat about this area, having litigated some of the aftermath. The celebrity cameo explanations of subprime debt, collateralized debt obligations, and synthetic CDOs are not only simple but accurate -- the two involving Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez are downright elegant. The key concept of the credit default swap comes out nicely through the dialogue -- a chance to buy fire insurance on the house down the street just before it catches fire. There are a couple of more points that could have used the same thing, especially when people start talking about &quot;FICO scores.&quot; It could also have been a little more clear that the eventual collapse was delayed because the smarter investment banks like Goldman finally woke up, saw it coming, unloaded their CDO inventory on investors who were still asleep, and cut their losses by buying swaps themselves. But this is a smart, entertaining telling of an outrageous true story. It deserves all the praise it has gotten, and maybe an Oscar for best adapted screenplay. If it teaches people without a financial background a little of what went on, it will be more than a momentary entertainment. But it will certainly entertain.",

He plays Viktor Navorski and he is in America from his Eastern European home, but since there is turmoil in his land, he can&apos;t get permission to step foot onto American soil.\n\nIn a movie such as this one, you are greatly relying on the actor to carry it. This is a movie with no action, no real romance, no special effects, and no scene changes. Tom Hanks does an excellent job as the broken English speaking European. There are a few engaging incidents throughout the movie while the main story prods along: that being Viktor trying to get permission to walk outside the airport. There are a few other interesting characters, and there is even a bit of anticipation as you hold on to find out exactly why Viktor is in America. I liked the movie. I thought Tom was wonderful and I thought the character combination was choice.",

      "name": "Flawed but thrilling British horror movie",
      "reviewBody": "In England a group of animal rights activists break into a research facility to free monkeys.  However the monkeys are infected with a new developed virus called rage which is contagious by blood or bodily fluid - at the same time Jim lies in a coma.  28 days later Jim awakens from his state to find London deserted and populated only by a group of those infected by rage. Jim is rescued by Selena and her friend who tell him what has happened and start a search for other survivors and a quest to find the cure, promised by a military unit stationed in the north.\n\nI excitedly arrived at the preview for this looking forward to a tense British horror movie to make me jump with fear.  I got pretty much what I wanted.  The plot is simple and omits much detail but not to it&apos;s disservice.  Details as to what the virus is or what it was created in the first place (by putting monkeys in front of TV&apos;s Clockwork Orange style?) but the detail is not important seconds into the film when we wake up with Jim.  At this point his fear becomes ours and what is important to him is not the detail but the bigger picture of the infected and the chances of survival.\n\nThe plot is told in two parts.  First the big picture in London and then the smaller battle north of Manchester.  Both are well told but for different reasons.  The bridging section of the journey north is good as it helps us know the characters better.  Of course is it scary?  Well, not scary but thrilling all the way.  To me scary is things like Ringu - creepy stuff, but most will be freaked by 28 days later.  The infected are not zombies in definition or in action - they move silently and fast and with pure blood lust. I was always more scared by zombie flicks than anything else becomes they keep coming - here they do the same but fast!\n\nThe direction is good for the most part.  The opening scene in London just shows how badly Crowe did his bit in Vanilla Sky.  Here it is clever and chilling to see much of London totally empty.  The direction is better when it is fast cutting and handheld style.  We see things like the characters would see them out of the corner of their eyes, a flicker, a shadow etc and it works to great effect.  The only downside is that, at one or two points, the attacks were signalled by a preceding talking 5 minutes, but this is minor.  The final rain soaked action is excellent - fast, gripping and paced.  This film doesn&apos;t rely on gore or special effects (although it is there) instead it has genuine tension and fear.\n\nThe film is very British.  It is very low-key and realistic.  The survivors are not Mad Max style heroes but people clinging to life by a thread or setting up survivalist measures that simply don&apos;t work.  The ending is not as good as I had hoped but it wasn&apos;t bad and it fitted with the tone of reality that Jim had realised when lying on his back in the woods towards the end.  It&apos;s not without flaws but the film is a very good British horror film - Americans will wonder `where are all the teenager girls to scream&apos; or `why don&apos;t they all have guns&apos; or `why is there no real dah-dah music to tell us when something is going to happen&apos; but that is because this is a British film and not Hollywood.\n\nMost reviews have praised the `unknown&apos; cast.  Well I agree the cast did very well - but unknown?  Murphy certainly is not unknown (and won&apos;t be from now on) and he does Jim very well, from when the truth is first real to him, to his decision that he must learn to kill through to his transformation near the end.  Harris is excellent again, I say again as she did well in miniseries `white teeth&apos;.  Her accent is British and she plays a younger role but she is a good actress.  Brendan Gleeson is good in a fatherly role but Eccleston seems clipped and at odds with his military role.  In fact all the military guys were laddish caricatures and only just did the job - but I never believed in their characters as I did with the others.\n\nOverall I was glad to see this early.  I really enjoyed it, the pace at times may have been uneven but to me that added to the tension - an attack could come at any time.  The eventual small scale focus helped the tension and pace of the story.  Thrilling, scary, tense and well written - even more surprising is that it&apos;s home grown!"

      "reviewBody": "Recently the other Dude and I were discussing that not many award worthy movies come out during the summer; then I see The Help. To say it is not a story that I am normally interested in would be an understatement. I wasn&apos;t around during the time of segregation to fully appreciate the depth of this story. Additionally, if there was ever a movie that screamed &quot;chick flick&quot; it would be this one. In spite of that, I&apos;ve heard wonderful things about the book and decided to view the movie. I&apos;m happy to say that I&apos;m glad that I did. Virtually unknown director Tate Taylor put together a cast of relatively unknown actors and actresses that truly made the story go. \n\nTaylor, whose last movie was the little seen Pretty Ugly People, grabbed a familiar actress to join him in making The Help, Allison Janney. Other than Janney the only other familiar actresses in the movie are Cicely Tyson and Sissy Spacek. The rather unknown cast has a fresh feeling on the story and there are no preconceived notions based on a past actor or actresses work. That being said Emma Stone (Easy A), and Viola Davis had a true coming out party in The Help. Both women played fantastic parts, which really made the cast mesh nicely together. Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain were all spectacular in supporting roles alongside Stone and Davis.\n\nWhen a movie doesn&apos;t have the explosions, crazy action or crude humor that we&apos;ve become accustomed to seeing in newer movies there has got to be a great story attached in order to maintain your interest; The Help had that great story. There aren&apos;t many movies that have you laughing, crying, or getting angry and end up still being fantastic and that is where this one had me. With my common rule of no movie should be over 2 hours unless it is special; this one is very special. I would be surprised if there aren&apos;t a number of nominations coming.\n\nChildren: If they can handle a lot of dialog it is age appropriate for 10+ Award Worthy: YES! Nominations for: Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Screenplay, Picture, Director Entertaining: Yes Summer Movie Grade: A+ Is it Worth the Price of a Movie ticket: Yes Would I watch It Again: Yes\n\nVisit our site at www.twodudereview.com",

Johann Johannsson&apos;s score is another exciting driving force upon which the film is carried. It was powerful. Incredible action-thriller. It was extremely dark. Not color wise, but the subject matter. Villeneuve really knows how to take the most vile subjects and turn them into intense n dark cinema. The acting was top notch especially Del Toro. He is comfortable with this sort of material and it really shows. I hav always been a fan of Brolin after no country for old men. His character was so relaxed n mean with those slip ons quiet opposite to del toro&apos;s who u slowly get to know as the movie unfolds. Del toro&apos;s character was emotionless and relentless. It is his best performance to date. The only scene i couldn&apos;t digest was the dinner scene. I turned my eyes n was shocked for few mins.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve never read Stieg Larsson&apos;s millennium novels, so I can&apos;t say how  faithful this film is to the original material, but I am a big fan of  the Swedish adaptation by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev. Now, I  know the fact that Hollywood is obsessed with remakes annoys the hell  out of us, but I think there can always be room for different  interpretation, different vision and approach and that&apos;s what David  Fincher&apos;s version excels in. It&apos;s more detailed, more curious, and more  unafraid. It&apos;s a superb and chilling thriller with an astounding  performance by Rooney Mara. Whether or not this version is better can  be argued but it certainly is a solid film   Rooney Mara, with her skinny body and goth hairstyle and excessive  piercings and tattoos and her attitude, I think Mara manages to give a  more complex Lisbeth Salander than Noomi Rapace&apos;s portrayal. But it&apos;s  mostly thanks to screenwriter Steven Zaillian who covers information  that the previous adaptation would simply skim or just talk about  instead of exposing it. Fincher and Zaillian want to seriously show how  dark, troubled, but motivated Lisbeth is. And some may consider this  approach to be too brutal or unnecessary but I think it&apos;s no more  brutal than Fincher&apos;s previous thrillers like Se7en. This is after all,  in its essence, a movie made solely for Fincher&apos;s fans or those who are  comfortable with his style. Jeff Cronenweth&apos;s cinematography work is  fantastic by the way, it plays on how much you can handle. It goes  along with the script that tends to be explanatory. Whatever loopholes  or gaps that the previous adaptation had, Fincher&apos;s film fills it and  explains it in its own way.  Lisbeth Salander to me is a rebel, she lives by her own rules, but  she&apos;s also by herself, this version wants to instill in her mind the  idea that perhaps she could be sociable or she could be considered  normal if she just gets that attention that she never did, and that&apos;s  what warrants a different ending. Mara is absolutely phenomenal as  Lisbeth, it&apos;s a defining role for Mara, she&apos;s made it her own. She&apos;s  fierce, highly driven, but there&apos;s a sense of innocence to her as well.  She thinks her anger and actions are justified and the film  successfully encourages us to agree.  All those tattoos and piercings are like &apos;keep off&apos; or &apos;stay away&apos;  sign, perhaps because of years of rough background, going from one  guardian to another, so when somebody genuine like Mikael Blomkvist  (Daniel Craig) comes along, he represents the safety that desperately  longs for but would never admit to. I think it&apos;s smart that Fincher and  Zailian shows the estranged family side of Blomkvist, they see it as  important for Blomkvist to be able to relate to Henrik Vanger&apos;s  (Christopher Plummer) dilemma and I think that&apos;s a smart move. Craig is  the weakest link because his accent keeps going on and off, I&apos;m not  sure if he even tries to sound Swedish at all, it&apos;s quite the  distraction. But he works with what&apos;s given to him, keep in mind that  the title is not Blomkvist with the dragon tattoo.  Of course nowadays you can&apos;t talk about Fincher&apos;s movies without  talking a bit about the unconventional score by Oscar winners Atticus  Ross and Nine Inch Nail&apos;s Trent Reznor. In fact, the movie pays an  amusing homage to NIN. Those of you film score aficionados would  probably find Ross and Reznor&apos;s tunes for this film rather eerie and  chilling, which it then pretty much serve its purpose. Having said  that, at times I find the score a bit forceful and it&apos;s like the same  soundwave echoing over and over again with the intent to hypnotize. I  don&apos;t think the opening graphic credit is all that impressive, it&apos;s an  interesting take but it looks out of place, it looks like it should be  a separate music video and it doesn&apos;t necessarily introduce the tone of  the film that you&apos;re about to see.  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is definitely not a movie for the faint  of heart, it&apos;s a movie that would rattle your comfort cage, and I think  audiences will be divided, you&apos;ll either truly love it, or truly detest  it, but there will hardly be a middle ground.",

The characters are pulling away from a hyped up society, away from a world, much of which is based on needless, trivial noise. Everywhere they go there is more numbing action. Watching the director of the commercial gyrating, trying to act like a real film director, despite the fact that they are doing a 30 second liquor commercial, typifies some of what this movie is about, a world where people are worn into the ground by a type A culture that is as vapid and unnecessary as we can imagine. I thought the Bill Murray character developed tremendously. While this trip to Japan was excruciatingly dull (money isn&apos;t everything), I believe that he began to see things he hadn&apos;t seen before. I liked that while he was struggling with his marriage, the crises were simple, day to day things that living brings to us. The young woman he meets shows through a whimsical kindness, that he is worth something. She is refreshing to look at an to be with. He, like many middle aged men, has self doubts. Because she has a sense of purity and can talk to him honestly about her world and his, he should go back to his life a little more sustained.",

      "reviewBody": "Wolverine is one of the iconic characters in both the Marvel Universe as well as the 20th Century Fox&apos;s movies; so is his Adamantium claws and healing factor. An immortal and living through ages he does have a lot of stories ready to be told through movies/comics. We did get an Origin movie, X-Men Origins Wolverine which was panned by critics and audiences alike. But I felt it was trashed more than it deserved to be. It had loads of action and bits from the original Wolverine Origin story arc but it did trash the character for the sake of being an action-heavy summer blockbuster. A weak script, irrelevant characters and a stupid take on &apos;the merc with a mouth&apos; underwhelmed the audiences. Anyways The Wolverine salvages some of its lost prestige putting a lot of focus on the core character.\n\nRumors that Darren Aronofsky&apos;d be helming the new Wolverine had me excited but the director&apos;s chair was handed over to James Mangold in the end. I am not skeptic at all regarding Mangold&apos;s directing prowess, as evident from gems like 3:10 to Yuma, Walk the line and Identity. But I was wondering how he&apos;d handle a superhero flick. After watching it, its safe to say Mangold&apos;s direction is far better than what I&apos;d expected it to be.\n\nThe Wolverine is undoubtedly based on Frank Miller&apos;s take on the superhero and I was already familiar with the names Mariko, Shingen and Yukio. It all came like a whiff of fresh air. The Wolverine is sort of a reboot for the series and a brilliant stepping stone for a new franchise which could tell a parallel story to the X-Men movies. Although it has its roots attached to the previous flicks, we are dropped into the midst of Wolverine&apos;s story. There ain&apos;t no origin, there ain&apos;t no &apos;Previously&apos;; instead we are just dropped into a narrative which ploughs forward to the thick of Japan. The Wolverine could be compared to treatment our superheros been getting recently. He&apos;s been stripped off his healing factors and he is left like so almost the entire movie and it does bring out some tension. I mean when he had the healing power, we knew he wouldn&apos;t just die even if she&apos;s split into two (admit it!)\n\nThe Wolverine is directed well and so was it well written and the action sequences well choreographed but its not without its flaws though. As mentioned above The Wolverine still has the debris it&apos;s carried on from X-Men The Last Stand and I wasn&apos;t pleased with it. Wolverine has flashbacks of his lost love? Seriously? Isn&apos;t it time his healing factor took care of that already? I mean its the god-damn Wolvie we&apos;re talking about here. Jean Grey&apos;s flashbacks (more like boring nightmares and more than once) kept crawling into the plot disrupting the pace and I just didn&apos;t like it. Of course Wolverine is tormented from what he&apos;d done in the past but that doesn&apos;t mean, we the audience need to be tormented from start to end. The Japan setting was a bit distracting as well and maybe thats a personal thing. I am not a big fan of Martial arts movies and there was an excess of martial arts settings and jargon here in the movie though it all did look good. Props were fantastic and the action sequences thick, especially the Bullet Train sequence is something to gape at.\n\nHugh Jackman effortlessly steps into his Wolverine shoes for the 6th time and having worked with Mangold in Kate &amp; Leopold did wonders for The Wolverine. This is the Logan we&apos;ve all praised and been used to and Hugh easily slides into the role and storyline straight from X-Men The Last Stand albeit forgetting X-Men Origins Wolverine. But then again playing Wolverine would have become second instinct for Hugh by now. Supporting cast couldn&apos;t be praised for the same, most of them being just bait for the plot. Especially Wolverine love interest in the movies, I felt they had absolutely no chemistry. Rila Fukushima did an absolutely splendid job playing Yukio. I had huge expectations for Svetlana Khodchenkova who played the only other mutant in the movie, Viper but she just served for some eyecandy and wasn&apos;t even fleshed up to be a proper antagonist.\n\nFor what its worth, The Wolverine is a splendid action movie which concentrates more on the character and the plot than heavy heavy action sequences. If you are an X-Men/Wolverine fan you are gonna love it and please do stay back after the credits coz there is a monumental end- credit to be seen there.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Cars didn&apos;t ride on it to make great time; they rode on it to have a great time.&quot; \n\nIt&apos;s not hard to make a successful movie. It&apos;s simple, really. Exceed my expectations. Make me feel. Force me to care. Deliver a somewhat clichéd message, but deliver it in such a way that the meaning resounds. Teach me the same lessons that your characters learn. And above all, entertain.\n\nPretty easy, right? Well, at least Pixar makes it look that way because with Cars they have once again succeeded.\n\nI&apos;ll be honest; I had my doubts about the movie. How would they be able to take a story featuring nothing but vehicles, with nary a human in sight, and keep my interest for a full two hours? Animals are one thing, but could Pixar successfully master the personification of modes of transportation? \n\nYes, they could, and they did.\n\nThanks to Director Lasseter&apos;s strong attention to detail, going so far as to insist that the vehicles bend and gesture in ways that were true to their construction, every car and truck truly becomes a unique character and personality. And along with those characters and personalities comes a story which yes, contains a well-traveled theme, but it comes with so much charm that even Grouchy McKilljoy&apos;s hard little heart can&apos;t help but be warmed.\n\nDon&apos;t worry if you&apos;re not a racing fan; I assure you it&apos;s not a requirement to enjoy the movie. I love watching muscle cars race the quarter mile (ask me about my &apos;69 Camaro), but NASCAR doesn&apos;t do it for me. That&apos;s another aspect about the film that gave me pause. I once fell asleep at a NASCAR qualifying race, despite the 90-degree heat and ear-splitting decibel levels, so would Cars keep me awake and interested? Within five minutes my worries began to slowly subside as I happily settled in for the ride.\n\nAnimation should be about bringing imagination to life. Give us something that can&apos;t be done in live action. Cars does this so effectively that it almost seems a redundancy to comment on how Pixar continues to raise the CGI bar. The scenery on screen is awe-inducing to the point that it&apos;s getting harder to distinguish the real from the created. The filmmakers have gone so far as to perfect reflections in the cars and to pay careful attention to weeds growing out of cracks in the sidewalk. I don&apos;t see any way you could not be visually stunned.\n\nBut impressive visuals are little comfort if I&apos;m not presented with a story that I care to follow. No problems there. If you&apos;re the kind of person who loves to go &quot;awwwww&quot; at movies then prepare to be satisfied. What I appreciate the most is that, at the risk of causing some youngsters to become restless, time and attention has been given to character and story development. Lasseter and his team stood their ground and resisted any pressure to trim this to a runtime more suitable to those with limited attention spans, and I thank them for it.\n\nAs I said earlier, Cars hit the starting line with a disadvantage. I didn&apos;t greet it with a warm smile. I crossed my arms, furrowed my brow, and dared it to prove my preconceived notions wrong.\n\nIt proceeded to exceed my expectations. It made me feel for its characters and forced me to care about McQueen&apos;s journey, both to California and to a different viewpoint on life. Sure, the &quot;slow down and enjoy the scenery&quot; message may seem a little routine, but it&apos;s a message I took to heart.\n\nImmediately following the movie I was on the Internet looking up information regarding Route 66. I&apos;m now ready for a road trip void of interstates and efforts to beat my best time. I feel like slowing down a bit and exploring the unknown. Give me the scenic route, and give me more finely-tuned, detailed movies like Cars. That&apos;s all I ask. Two hours of entertainment that make me care, even if briefly, about something other than myself and what goal has to be accomplished next.\n\nSee? It was simple, really. At least Pixar made it look that way.",

David (Jason Sudeikis) is still a pot dealer, even though he&apos;s 20 years past college. \n\nTwo teens in need of parental figures screw up his simple drug-dealing lifestyle and now he has to smuggle a load of marijuana across the border. A fake family should be the perfect cover to fool the hapless border guards. He hires the two teens and his sexy neighbour, Rose (Jennifer Aniston), who is working as a stripper, even though she&apos;s more than 20 years past college. \n\nThe comedy builds slowly, but then a fake baby (let&apos;s call her Mary Jane) enters the picture and the laughs come fast and furious. Some jokes weren&apos;t as funny as they thought (their new friends&apos; sex acts), but by this time our fake family has connected with one another and the audience, and their obvious ending can drive us towards the conclusion of the ridiculous plot. \n\nOverall, &quot;We&apos;re the Millers&quot; is pretty funny, and if you&apos;re watching a stoner comedy, you should be pretty forgiving of any nonsense the plot throws at you.",

Honestly, it felt to me like the film dragged and that the ending would never arrive. Even though not fully engaged and not empathetic towards any character depicted, there is enough style that I somehow cared about how the story ended. Every scene seemed to me like an exercise in an acting class. It feels like a professor took a group of talented actors and gave them this over-the-top 1970&apos;s assignment. Everyone gets an &quot;A&quot; because they are that good but it barely felt like a coherent film to me. It&apos;s like their assignment included constant references to try and deliver a &quot;Goodfellas&quot; type tone without having a script to back it up. The events of the conclusion were so easy to spot that I&apos;m sure most everyone will see it coming a mile away. \n\nOverall, interesting but there is far less substance than I was expecting.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Captain Phillips&quot; is the Hollywood retelling of the true-to-life 2009 harrowing story of an American container vessel Maersk Alabama (with Captain Richard Phillips at the helm) being held hostage by Somali pirates. The screenplay by Billy Ray was based on the novel &quot;A Captain&apos;s Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea&quot; written by Captain Richard Phillips himself.\n\nPlaying the titular character, Tom Hanks is what this film is all about. He starts off simply, playing Capt. Phillips as a family man and seasoned seaman on a routine delivery. However when the pirates came, you see him transform into a cool-under-pressure leader and shrewd tactician, matching wits with these desperate aggressors. In the last five minutes, Hanks would give us an unexpected display of emotion which may well deliver him another Oscar for Best Actor.\n\nThe four Somali-American first-time actors playing the pirates are a very realistic bunch. They play with wild-eyed and feral intensity, really scary. Barkhad Abdi plays their skinny foolhardy leader Muse, engaging Phillips in a deadly chess game, toe-to-toe. Faysal Ahmed plays the hot-headed Najee, who was the loose cannon of the group. Barkhad Abdirahman plays the young recruit Bilal, getting himself a baptism of fire on his first time out. \n\nWhen I saw the name director Paul Greengrass in the credits, I understood why the sense of tension and urgency were so well-conveyed. This was that familiar sense of excitement we felt in his previous films, like the last two Jason Bourne films or that suspenseful 9/11 drama &quot;United 93&quot;. He really knows how to make military operations exciting on screen, as he did for the Army in &quot;Green Zone&quot; and the Navy SEALS in this film.\n\nI have to admit I was on the verge of getting seasick with the shakiness of the camera, but luckily I held on despite the two-hour length of the film set at sea.\n\nOverall, this is a different sort of adventure drama, with a topic not too commonly tackled in a mainstream film. We hear of these events on the news, but this film brings us right in the middle of one. We will feel the tension building as the pirates were approaching. We will feel the fear when the pirates were on board. We will feel the desperation and the frustration of being trapped in the middle of the open ocean with no help immediately forthcoming. If you are up for such a realistic experience, then this film is for you.",

      "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s say it straight away: before &quot;Mystic River&quot; (2003), Clint Eastwood&apos;s last works had left me a little unsatisfied; particularly &quot;Blood Work&quot; (2002), a watchable thriller with a certain charm but without great originality. But the following year, with &quot;Mystic River&quot;, he made a sensational comeback and quite obviously this movie, which critically and commercially gave a boost to his career is his most accomplished since &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992).\n\nBy watching &quot;Mystic River&quot; one can feel that Clint Eastwood, more than ever put a lot of effort into the elaboration of his movie. From a subtle screenplay written by Brian Helgeland who shows that he is a far better scriptwriter than director (as far as I&apos;m concerned, I hated the rather insipid &quot;A Knight&apos;s Tale&quot; 2001), Eastwood develops an absorbing and ingenious directing which contributes in weaving a shady and even stifling by moments atmosphere. On another extent, Eastwood takes back a way that had worked for him in &quot;Blood Work&quot;: favoring calm and patience. And indeed, on an unhurried pace, the film-maker takes all his time to shot the evolution of this detective story. More important, he made this choice for another reason: to do a thorough psychological study of the three main characters. The basis of &quot;Mystic River&quot; consists in a classic detective investigation (nevertheless passionating in its construction) doubled with a relevant description of the three main protagonists.\n\nTo watch &quot;Mystic River&quot; is like to find oneself on the edge of a forest and to disappear into it. The more the movie progresses, the more we discover three heart-broken characters because they are linked by dark events. First, Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn). We learn that he has flirted with violence and has spent a few years in jail but he seems to have become a well-behaved man: he works in a grocery store and regularly goes to church. But the death of his daughter crushed him and he is determined to avenge her. Then, Sean Divine (Kevin Bacon) who appears as a reliable and lucid cop but whose private life is hell: he experienced a failed marriage and his wife keeps on harassing him day and night. At last, Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), a broken father who underwent a deep traumatic experience (he was kidnapped and raped by two men who claimed to be priests). The consequences are terrible: he can&apos;t communicate anymore, he can&apos;t defend himself anymore and he wanders like a ghostly figure in the streets of his neighborhood. As a matter of fact, this traumatic scene is at the root of the three characters&apos; misfortunes. Being the very first sequence of the movie, it sets the tone of Clint Eastwood&apos;s 24th movie. It presents Jimmy, Sean and Dave playing in a street. The sky is gray, the houses of the neighborhood are bare and austere. The ball which disappears through the manhole may symbolize the loss of childhood. Then, a big black car arrives. One of the men gets out and claims to be a priest (or does he?). He orders Dave to go into the car and the latter drives away. This moment will haunt the three boys for the rest of the lives and will deeply influence their personality. Roughly, &quot;Mystic River&quot; demonstrates in a conclusive way how such a past dramatic event can influence our present lives.\n\nIn virtually all the critics I have read, &quot;Mystic River&quot; was hailed for its cast. It&apos;s true that Penn, Bacon and Robbins rank among the best American actors of their generation and I think we will never thank Eastwood enough for having reunited them. By giving a lot of depth to their respective characters, one can feel that they were giving their all, which can explain why the movie was shot in a rather short time (39 days). They may even never battle their dazzling performances. And the rest of the cast is just as equal as the whole, especially the actresses whose female characters have an important role in the story since they influence (unconsciously or not) their husbands&apos; actions and characters.\n\nTo a third degree, Eastwood&apos;s major work is also used to denounce the deceptive superficiality of the appearances, the omnipresence of violence and the credulity of many inhabitants. The film opens with an overview of the neighborhood but doesn&apos;t show yet that it is devastated by violence. No matter what the time is. Violence is omnipresence and the fact that it touches younger generations proves that it isn&apos;t ready to subside.\n\nAt last, let&apos;s also congratulate Eastwood for the remarkable music he has signed himself with his son. With this music, simplicity rhymes with efficiency. One has just to listen to a few notes to feel an intense emotion inside us.\n\nIn the middle of all these qualities, there are just minor faults. So, Bacon is a tormented cop due to his disastrous marriage and however, we really don&apos;t know what went wrong with his wife. Is it Dave&apos;s kidnapping? Is it his trying job? This point remains ambiguous. Ambiguous is also the adjective that suits the best to qualify the end of the film. What can mean the gesture Bacon makes to Penn? But these two points let freely the way to any possible interpretation.\n\nThe contribution of the crew in Eastwood&apos;s work is total and so is my enthusiasm for &quot;Mystic River&quot;. If you haven&apos;t seen it yet, go and watch it. You won&apos;t regret it. At the age of 73 years old, &quot;grandad&quot; Clint Eastwood is still in great form and given the recent triumph of &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; (2004), he seems to have decided to bring the house down again in the landscape of American cinema for our greatest pleasure.",

      "name": "&quot;The Thing&quot; is John Carpenter&apos;s masterpiece and one of the best classic horror films!",
      "reviewBody": "A classic film. John Carpenter&apos;s &quot;The Thing&quot; is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made - fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?\n\nSeriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design. \n\nIn my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I&apos;ll put any of &quot;The Thing&apos;s&quot; old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven&apos;t seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see &quot;The Thing&quot; again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who&apos;s your friend? Who&apos;s the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you&apos;ve never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy/gal next to you really real?\n\n&quot;Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.&quot; \n\nJohn Carpenter&apos;s The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero&apos;s Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.\n\nThe basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell&apos;s outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.\n\nIt is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80&apos;s ever. I love this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from master and genius John Carpenter! &apos;The Thing&apos; is classic Carpenter and one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell&apos;s characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt&apos;s best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!! 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",

The romance was well... romantic. It may have been a little too sappy and forced to me, but still cute. All in all, the movie was a perfect blend of comedy, mystery, action, drama, and romance. Thus, a new fan base was created.The only problems with this movie were the acting was a bit shaky at some points and it diverged from the books a lot too (see what I did there). The characters were well developed in the movie as well as the book, but some details about the characters were left out from the movie that were in the book. The settings and storyline did the same thing as well.",

      "name": "Great end to the trilogy",
      "reviewBody": "I know it&apos;s hard for any sequel to live up to the original. Yes, the first &apos;Back to the Future&apos; film is definitely the best, but - come on - as far as sequels go, &apos;Parts II &amp; III&apos; are still pretty impressive. I know they may not have the same &apos;original feel&apos; to them, but they at least to a fantastic job of expanding the original concept/mythology and growing the much-loved characters we met in the first outing.\n\nI doubt there are many people who will decide to watch &apos;Part III&apos; of a trilogy first, so my advice is watch them all in order. Then you can experience the full magic of watching a young high school student (Marty McFly - played perfectly by Michael J Fox) get caught up in with his friend &apos;Doc Brown&apos;s&apos; (played by the only person seemingly capable of upstaging Michael J Fox here - Christopher Lloyd) exploits with a time-travelling DeLorean car\n\nThere&apos;s a brief recap at the beginning of the film as to how our heroes have become stuck in the past and now they have to go further back to the Wild West in order to get home - don&apos;t worry, if that sounds confusing - it all makes sense if you&apos;ve watched all three.\n\nWhat you have here is a movie that feels totally at home in the &apos;Back to the Future&apos; trilogy, but this time is set among cowboys and spittoons. It delights in poking fun of the time period and genre, plus gives us familiar faces/enemies in the form of series antagonist &apos;Biff Tannen&apos;s&apos; long lost grandfather as a murderous outlaw - naturally hell-bent on causing all sorts of problems for our heroes. Plus we even have a love interest for Doc - which does add a new dimension to the story. Normally if a new character is introduced so late it feels a bit jarring - I&apos;m glad to say that here the insertion of &apos;Clara Clayton&apos; feels organic and a necessity to the overall story.\n\nYou may not love it as much as the first, you may also consider this (or the second) to be the &apos;weakest&apos; in the series, but even if that&apos;s true - it&apos;s still fantastic family entertainment. There are few films that can be considered &apos;timeless&apos; (especially those made today), but the &apos;Back to the Future&apos; trilogy can still be enjoyed by the whole family and holds up as it ever did (even if it did fail to predict what 2015 would look like and many of us are still waiting for hover boards and Nike self-lacing trainers!).\n\n&apos;Rick and Morty&apos; may be cool, but they&apos;ll never be as well-loved as those they are spoofing. Long may the &apos;Back to the Future&apos; trilogy never be remade/rebooted/whatever. &apos;Part III&apos; may only be an 8/10, but overall the series will always remain a &apos;perfect 10.&apos;",

      "reviewBody": "Based on the TV show of the same name, Brian De Palma&apos;s stylish thriller stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt; a James Bond-esquire secret agent working for a certain section of the government. As the title suggests, many of the scenarios in the film are extremely unlikely; but then again, the film wouldn&apos;t be living up to it&apos;s title if they weren&apos;t. It&apos;s one thing to criticise it&apos;s stunts for being overblown, but if they weren&apos;t, critics would be on it&apos;s back and calling it things like &apos;Mission Possible&apos;, so really you&apos;ve just got to go with it. Brian De Palma makes it easy to just &apos;go with it&apos; by way of an intriguing plot line, a constant array of high-octane sequences and lots of his trademark style! The plot does get a little too convoluted for it&apos;s own good at times, and sometimes it&apos;s a little hard to follow; but it gives the film a good basis for all manner of impossibilities, so it serves it&apos;s purpose. We follow Ethan Hunt and his team. After a botched mission, Hunt finds himself on the run from his employers after being accused of disloyalty. Hunt must now pull out all the stops to stay one step ahead of his pursuers and get to the bottom of why their mission went wrong.\n\nThe film features a number of stunts, the best of which sees Tom Cruise breaking into the CIA via the roof. This sequence is brilliantly executed, with De Palma managing to inject bucketloads of suspense into the scene. This scene fits the tone of the film as it&apos;s brooding and cerebral, but the film ditches that idea for it&apos;s conclusion, which sees a bullet train, a helicopter and the Channel Tunnel combine to great effect! The problem with all these stunts is that the parts between the action sequences aren&apos;t all that interesting, and at times can slow the film down to walking pace. This isn&apos;t a big problem, however, because there&apos;s always more action around every corner and that keeps the film going. Tom Cruise obviously has charisma and can lead a film, but I often find it hard to buy him in action roles. This one suits him, though, as although his character is still more than capable, he comes off as being quite vulnerable, and lucky at times, and that suits Cruise&apos;s persona. On the whole, while this isn&apos;t a great film; it makes for good entertainment and if that&apos;s what you&apos;re in the mood for, Mission: Impossible wont disappoint.",

      "reviewBody": "Abrams is merely an efficient technician, uninteresting as a man of vision. But we need guys like him, conservative and mechanical in their efficiency, who will hold down the paradigm as others more adventurous fight to shift it, who will remind us by the arbitrary limits they impose that there must be a broader space. It&apos;s always the routine and familiar that kindles dreaming.\n\nAnd this is just so routine. Abrams takes the Spielberg-Lucas model of climax after climax, starting with an Indiana Jones prologue. A few simple moral dilemmas form the backbone, inherited with a wink from the Trek genealogy. The hamfisted 9/11 allegory, enforced by terrorist bombings and a final &apos;plane crash&apos; in Starfleet hq, is that we may covet revenge but we are dehumanized in the process. Khan as a vengeful mujahedeen, &apos;trained&apos; by the secret military which is headed by a cowboy admiral hellbent on preemptive war. (Interestingly, everything about Khan&apos;s handling here bears Nolan&apos;s influence.)\n\nSoulless. \n\nSo it is fitting that this guy is spearheading the next generation of established cinematic imagination, taking over from Lucas who is now retired, and Spielberg who is &apos;respectable&apos;. I&apos;m sure that in 20 years time he will be making his own respectable war movies. That kids growing up on stuff like this will fondly elevate the memory. And that his idea of artistry, Welles&apos; action camera dotted by twinkles of color, lasers and flares, will be elaborated on in essays about his aesthetics, maybe.\n\nAll of which is just a natural state of things, nothing to get up in arms about. It just means that the interesting stuff will be defined by contrast to him."

      "reviewBody": "I was torn while watching Bourne Supremacy. I&apos;ll just go ahead and say this before I mislead. I loved this movie! Unfortunately one key aspect just about dragged this film under the water. The camera was far too unstable. It was obviously done intentionally by design choice, but it was excessively overdone. Through action scenes that had you at the edge of your seat, you&apos;d just come to realize that you were only trying to see what the heck was going on. This made these scenes a little hard to enjoy. But not only was it the action scenes; even during quiet still scenes the camera would always seem to be moving, and eventually was giving me a headache. Just to serve as a warning, it&apos;s pretty much like that throughout most of the movie, so brace yourself for an adventure of epileptic proportions.\n\n-- However -- The acting was close to brilliant in my opinion. I don&apos;t think the casting for Jason Bourne gets any better than Matt Damon because he fits the part perfectly. The rest of the cast all pretty much played their parts well, so I am pleased to announce that there aren&apos;t any exceptionally bad actors or actresses. In addition of the immersive storyline, it created a much enjoyable film. For a sequel, this actually surprised me because I enjoyed this movie as much as I did the first. If you&apos;re into action flicks, this definitely will not bore you. If you liked the first movie, then you&apos;ll most likely be very pleased with the conclusion.",

      "reviewBody": "Among Hollywood&apos;s recent output of mediocre (and in some cases: downright abysmal) remakes of Sci-Fi classics, &apos;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&apos; was the rare movie which stood out, for it had as much of a brain as it had a heart – plus an original approach to the well-known material and great visuals. Having said that, &apos;Rise&apos; practically pales in comparison to Matt Reeves&apos; sequel: the upcoming &apos;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&apos; is as close to a Science-Fiction masterpiece as a 170 million PG-13 Hollywood summer blockbuster can possibly get.\n\nThe storyline picks up ten years after we saw Ceasar and his fellow simian escapees seek refuge in the woods near San Francisco, and although the film&apos;s trailers already gave away pretty much everything that happened during that time (and alas, way too much of what will happen), I&apos;m not going to spoil anything for those who carefully avoided watching said trailers. As with all my reviews, instead of giving away any details about the story, I&apos;ll elaborate on all other aspects of the movie.\n\nWhat needs to be mentioned first is what an astonishing achievement &apos;Dawn&apos; is when it comes to the use of CGI. I&apos;m normally very critical towards the (over-)use of CGI – but the level of craftsmanship displayed here simply has to be admired. It only took me seconds to forget I was watching digital characters (brought to life through the outstanding motion-capture performances by Andy Serkis, Toby Kebbell and Judy Grier – to name but a few), and I can&apos;t begin to imagine what a task it must have been for the artists and wizards in the animation department to work on every background and every tiny little detail of every character until this level of seamlessness and reality could be achieved.\n\nBut nearly every other aspect of the movie has been realized equally well: Michael Giacchino&apos;s haunting musical score fits and reflects the drama on screen perfectly, while the – often terrifying – beauty of the images on screen had me immediately wondering who the DoP was (now I know: Michael Seresin, the genius veteran DoP of such classics as &apos;Midnight Express&apos; and &apos;Angel Heart&apos;). When it comes to the action; well, &apos;Dawn&apos; is not your usual summer blockbuster. This is no light-hearted, comic-book-style fantasy film with fun, over-the-top action scenes. What we have here is a gritty, realistic portrayal of a slowly escalating conflict, and when we do get to the battle scenes in the third act, those scenes are a spectacular, mesmerizing visual feast (and ultimately heart breaking).\n\nBut the core of this film – and also the reason why the action scenes in the third act really do have an impact and all the mayhem really gets to you – is the intelligent, skilfully told story with its well-drawn, believable characters (portrayed by equally believable actors). The tragic simian/human conflict mirrors our real – and very human – past and present day wars and social frictions in a very credible way and thus makes this film resonate far beyond what any mere Sci-Fi premise would let you expect. \n\nSo my verdict: With its beautiful imagery, highly relevant story and breath-taking effects, &apos;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&apos; is as close to a Science-Fiction masterpiece as its mass-audience orientated constrictions allowed it to be (which – in this case – is very close); an astonishing achievement and highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;There should be no boundary between human endeavour,&quot; Stephen Hawking explains during a press conference. It is this line that strikes a chord at the very centre of James Marsh&apos;s incredible biopic on one of the most brilliant scientists of our time. The Theory of Everything is not just a story about the science behind the beginnings of our universe, but the science of love; and how life&apos;s challenges that we face everyday, shape who we are and what we achieve. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones turn in phenomenal performances as the revolutionary Stephen Hawking and his former wife Jane Wilde. Eddie&apos;s mentally and physically challenging role, displaying Hawkings brilliance and motor neuron disease, are extremely commendable and impressive (a sure fire for a Best Actor nomination at next year&apos;s Oscars). On the more sensitive side, Felecity displays the endless love and powerful fight Jane brought to the Hawking household. As the years pass, their lives are changed tremendously in very profound and heart-wrenching ways. The movie does not shy away from making Hawking a complex character, as well as Jane, showing both their positive and negative sides. I really liked that the movie was able to shape them into fully well-rounded characters despite the &quot;romance&quot; aspect of it. The score for the film is tremendous.. absolutely outstanding! It hits all the right marks, brings upon emotions right when you are on the verge of tears, leaves you in awe after a beautiful monologue, and finishes with a melancholy but very fitting tone. The script and directing were top-notch.. right up there with the best... and the cinematography? give that guy an award already! A masterpiece to watch. While some critics may be quick to judge how the film focuses more on the romance rather than the science that made Hawking so renowned, I believe that the love is what made him who he is today. Human endeavour is endless... Stephen never gave up hope, nor did Jane... and though their lives ended up in different places, it was their years together that displayed to us how a little bit of hope can go a very, very long way.\n\nVerdict: A beautiful story that shows how time and love are limitless... no beginning, no end (despite his earlier hypothesis). *****\n\nIn Theatres: November 7th, 2014 (USA), January 2, 2015 (UK)",

      "reviewBody": "Not since Se7en&apos;s John Doe has there been a serial killer with such a bizarre philosophy behind his actions (not that Jigsaw actually kills anyone; more on that later). Sure, in light of the increasingly deteriorating sequels it&apos;s hard to think of Saw as little more than a franchise- starter (something the writer and director never planned), but viewed on its own, astonishing merits, it&apos;s a good, nasty thriller, filled with solid scares and (especially compared to the follow-ups) quite well written.\n\nAccording to the film&apos;s notorious back-story, it took only 28 days to shoot it. Not that strange, given most of the action takes place in just two locations: one is a bathroom where Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) fins themselves with their feet chained to the wall, with no recollection whatsoever of how the hell they got there; the other is the lair of the mysterious Jigsaw, a serial killer whom Detectives Sing (Ken Leung) and Trapp (Danny Glover) have been tracking down for weeks.\n\nThe two facts are linked in a most ingenious way: Jigsaw doesn&apos;t really kill anyone, but &quot;plays a game&quot; with his victims. In the case of Adam and Dr. Gordon, as the tape recorder found in a dead man&apos;s hand tells them, each of them has two hours to free himself and kill the other, or they will both die. Problem is, the only way to get rid of the chains is to saw your foot off. And so, while the two unfortunate cell-mates have to choose who gets to live (that&apos;s Jigsaw&apos;s perverse logic: he offers you a choice), the police close in on the elusive psycho, whose previous deeds and MO are shown in flashbacks.\n\nWhereas the subsequent Saw films use the messy chronology just for the hell of it (though they do get away with some neat narrative tweaks thanks to it), the first installment takes advantage of its non-linear storytelling to increase the suspense and provide some valuable clues to how everything fits together. It is to James Wan and co-writer Whannell&apos;s eternal credit that they, like Se7en writer Andrew Kevin Walker, went beyond slasher clichés and came up with something more. Okay, so Saw&apos;s philosophical undertones aren&apos;t entirely original, but what the heck, they do manage to keep the audience interested in what&apos;s going on. In addition, adding a little more depth to the killer ensures that the movie&apos;s more gruesome parts (and there are a lot of them) don&apos;t come off as gratuitous bloodletting (for an example of the latter, look no further than the countless sequels to A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday 13th).\n\nFurthermore, the intelligence behind the film&apos;s structure might also have had a positive effect on the performances, given the acting is more convincing here than in most post-2000 shockers: Elwes and Whannell&apos;s desperation is conveyed with an intensity that&apos;s almost too painful to behold, Glover plays the aging cop role resisting the temptation to do a Lethal Weapon in-joke (you know, the &quot;too old for this sh*t&quot; gag) and when Jigsaw himself appears... well, it&apos;s the horror equivalent of Keyser Soze - chilling and impossible to forget (and, for once, not played by Kevin Spacey). Just like the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Stephen Spielberg took the 1953 classic War Of The Worlds and remade it for modern times and the modern techniques of special effects. A lot of things that could not be done back in the 50s are done now to show the havoc that the invaders reek upon the world. \n\nHe also did something else that possibly might have offended science fiction purists but I think gave the audience a better identification with the protagonists of the story. Instead of having his protagonists be scientists as Gene Barry and Ann Robinson were in 1953, Tom Cruise is a blue collar divorced father who has his kids visiting him, but custody is with their mother Miranda Otto.\n\nThe kids are no prizes and are played by Justin Chatwyn and Dakota Fanning. And Cruise himself is no bargain either. But when danger develops it&apos;s his idea to take them from New York to Boston where their mother and maternal grandparents are. The film as it was in 1953 is mostly concerned with their efforts to avoid the terrible tripod machines that the aliens use in their destructive path.\n\nThe film does follow the Barry/Robinson escape scenario closely. The two had a scene avoiding the aliens while they were trapped in a cellar. To that Spielberg adds survivalist Tim Robbins. I think Stephen Spielberg feels the way I do that a lot of these survivalists pray for their doomsday fantasy to come true. That was sure the case with Tim Robbins who is quite mad on the subject of the invaders.\n\nCruise himself centers and anchors the film with his portrayal of blue collar America who just wants for him and his family to survive the holocaust. This classic may yet see a remake or three in the future.",

      "reviewBody": "When an alien invasion, led by the sinister Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds in a motion capture performance), seems imminent, Batman (Ben Affleck) recruits the world&apos;s heroes to stop it. He seeks out Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), but their combined power may not be enough, and they realize the one missing factor that could turn the tide of battle: the recently deceased Superman (Henry Cavill).\n\nThis was another tortured production, with director Zack Snyder leaving the project either due to a death in the family or by the studio&apos;s insistence, depending on the source. Joss Whedon was brought on to finish the movie and ended up reshooting some earlier scenes. The final product seems rushed, under cooked, and dreadfully overloaded with too much unnecessary CGI effects. The common weakness in many of these superhero movies is the villain, and this is yet another example of that. The character is fully CGI and looks it, and it&apos;s difficult to feel menace from a cartoon in a non-animated movie. And the worst part is, it wasn&apos;t even needed, as the character was a normal human-looking person in the comic books, and the actor hired to basically just provide the voice, Ciaran Hinds, is a very good actor and would have been fine without the CGI embellishment. Another glaring visual flaw lies in Superman&apos;s mouth. Since the shoot ran over, Superman actor Henry Cavill was contractually obligated to start his filming on the upcoming Mission: Impossible film, a role that requires him to grow a bushy mustache. When he had to come back for reshoots on Justice League, the producers decided to just CGI out his mustache, with the end result a laughable, often deformed upper lip.\n\nOn the plus side, Ezra Miller is amusing as The Flash, Gal Gadot continues to look great as Wonder Woman, and Momoa makes for an interesting twist on Aquaman, who is nothing like his comic book counterpart. Many of the acting heavy-hitters, including Amy Adams, Diane Lane, and Jeremy Irons, are just cameo window dressing.",

I&apos;m just not much of a baseball movie fan though so I figured I&apos;d give it half an hour (because it was on TV) and bail. But somehow this held my interest despite the fact that (yes) its about baseball, odds/statistics and v-e-r-y slow moving.\n\nI can&apos;t even explain why I liked this? Well the amazing performances helped. Led by Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill as Oakland A&apos;s general manager Billy Beane who turns baseball on its ear when he reinvents the Oakland A&apos;s, by employing unorthodox scouting methods and statistical data to place a different sort of value on the players he picks for the team.\n\nThis did make me realize just how disposable the players are. Brutal. Oh, and apparently it&apos;s is based on a book, undoubtedly a very dry, heavy on statistics and number crunching, audience specific book. Kill me now! 09.13",

So what if the acting is a bit over the top, so what if there are probably too many explosions and bullets and bombs. The end result is a thoroughly entertaining 2 hours at the movies with popcorn and Pearl and Dean ads. Moriarty is sufficiently creepy and played with restraint, Holmes is completely over the top but for me if its Robert Downey Jr there are no complaints. The story keeps moving and the action is terrific. The story is loosely based on the last book of the Conan Doyle&apos;s first series of Holmes stories ending with the famous Reisenbach Falls in Switzerland. It also gives a great image of early 20th century on the brink of the first world war. If you want to enjoy a good story with great imagery and costume then you will enjoy this, if you are looking for Sherlock ( wonderfully called Shirley by Mycroft ) as Conan Doyle intended then you may be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "The Last Samurai is a brilliantly crafted aesthetic pleasure, studded with supernal performances from Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise. In fact, Tom Cruise unarguably gives his best ever performance, surpassing his portrayal of Jerry Maguire in the eponymous flick. His plaintive portrayal of Nathan Algren, not only evokes pathos but also seeks sympathy of the contemporary viewer, who can vicariously relate to Algren&apos;s disconcertion, owing to his inner conflicts of patriotism vis-à-vis humanity.\n\nHowever, it is Ken Watanabe, who steals the show with his mesmerizing and poignant portrayal of Katsumoto, the leader of the last clan of Samurai. His screen presence and delivery is truly amazing and even outshines that of Tom Cruise, which is a compliment in itself. The scenes between Watanabe and Cruise are pure gold, depicting fluctuating feelings of hostility, compassion and camaraderie. \n\nWatanabe&apos;s intense and powerful performance in which he displays a wide range of emotions, is definitely worthy of the coveted statuette, but the academy never fails to disappoint. Watanabe&apos;s brilliant portrayal, not only mesmerizes the viewers, but also convinces the critics of his acting abilities. The tacit adoration between Algren and Taka (subtly played by Koyuki), enormously adds to the beauty of the movie. All this coupled with some brilliant cinematography and a mesmerizing score, makes it a treat to watch and a truly surreal experience.\n\nhttp://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",

      "reviewBody": "For about three months now, I have (on an almost daily basis) passed a movie theatre not far from my home. On the side of this movie theatre is a huge poster advertising the movie &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;. Meanwhile, all I heard about on television was the buzz about the upcoming &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;. So, when this highly publicized movie finally opened, I went and saw it.\n\nI went to the theatre, I bought my ticket, I found a seat in a very crowded theatre and I sat. For three hours I sat in that dark theatre and I watched what was one of the most amazing movies I have ever had privilege to see.\n\nIt is hard to even begin to explain why this movie was amazing, but it was. The way it was shot is brilliant. The cinematography is spectacular. The story is completely enthralling.\n\nAlthough the movie was just shy of three hours long, it was not at all boring to watch. The story was captivating and although I knew how it was going to end (because, after all, it is a movie based on a true-ish story), it was incredible to watch how it got that end.\n\nAbove all, the movie was beautiful to watch. I have to admit to those who have not yet seen it that &quot;Gangs&quot; is quite violent. However, the violence was well shot and it was fairly necessary to the story.\n\nAll of the actors put in extremely good performances. Leonardo DiCaprio really proved that he&apos;s not just a pretty face and that he does actually have a great deal of talent (which can also be seen in his other movie of the season, &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;). Cameron Diaz&apos; performace also proves that she can do much more than the standard romantic comedy. Also, after hearing reports of Daniel Day Lewis&apos; REALLY getting into his character, I admit that it was completely worth it. His character (William Cutting/Bill the Butcher) is so complex and although you know you hate him, you can&apos;t decide why (for there are so many reasons).\n\nIn conclusion, if you have not seen this movie yet, go. Go now. See it. This is one of the epic movies of our time. I heard that Scorcese has been conceptualizing this movie for over twenty years; I could tell. The story this movie tells is one  that I had never heard and the way in which it was told makes it seem very important for us to know. The message that is conveyed, although not an entirely wholesome one, is an important one to learn and, if considered, is very relevant to our time. However, my only message to you is this: see this movie.",

He&apos;s hilarious. This film isn&apos;t just for kids but for the whole family. I think I was about 5 when I first saw it and at 14 I still watch it and so do my parents. I haven&apos;t seen the sequels because I heard that Robin Williams wasn&apos;t in them and decided that they wouldn&apos;t be as good without him. He was made for the part. The songs are amazing. I love singing along to &quot;A Whole new World&quot;. I&apos;m hoping to get the soundtrack soon. I also love the film because I have the same name as the princess in it! I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You&apos;re never too old to watch a classic Disney film.",

      "reviewBody": "From beneath the depths of Hell, the ultimate symbol of evil is about to be reborn.  Beyond mortality, beyond death, this creature of the undead will rise.  Darkness will fall for all of eternity...and this plague will forever swallow this planet Earth...\n\nAbout two thousand years ago, in the land of Ancient Egypt, a well-respected high priest known as Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) has been a very naughty man. His one-stand with the Pharaoh&apos;s mistress may very well cost him his life. After the Pharaoh discovers this illicit, forbidden love affair, Imhotep and the mistress murder the heartless Pharaoh without second thoughts.  As payback though, Imhotep is to suffer the gravest consequences...\n\nImhotep is eventually sentenced to die a most horrifying death.  The Pharaoh&apos;s guards have buried him alive inside a tomb, complete with ravaging scarabs and all.  What&apos;s even worse is that the guards have placed a disturbing curse upon the buried soul.   Whoever opens the tomb of this ancient evil will awaken the curse that has lied dormant for thousands of ears.  All shall suffer eternal damnation, as the Mummy will release its unstoppable powers upon the lands and onto the cities.   His reign of terror will spread...\n\nFor twenty centuries, this soul has rested in peace...  Jumping forward to 1925, a bunch of foolish archaeologists, driven by profit and ignoring all admonishments, have decided to open the tomb of the wretched Mummy.  Well, that decision was foolish...  Now, the armies of the dead will inhabit the Earth and evil will take over...  Only Colonel Rick O&apos;Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his brave team of courageous souls can prvent the Mummy&apos;s plans to rule the planet.  Along with an alluring librarian and inspiring archaeologist (Rachel Weisz), her timid brother (John Hannah), and an even more craven sidekick, Beni (Kevin J. O&apos;Connor), O&apos;Connell and his company of wisecracking Smart Alec folks are mankind&apos;s last hope.  This though, happens to be another incident where the good guys are at the wrong place at the right time.  Heaven have mercy on these souls...  Will faith spare human lives, or can the world kiss hope goodbye?\n\nTHE MUMMY is so much better than I originally anticipated.  The special effects alone will blow you away!  It is unbelievable how the Mummy is able to transform himself from a rotting, disintegrating corpse to a fully developed supernatural being, and even to a raging sandstorm.  Also, those creepy crawly scarabs scare the daylights out of me!  The scarabs literally crawl under people&apos;s skins!   Impressive production values, capturing and recreating the ruins of Hamunaptra at its full glory, serve as another highlight for THE MUMMY.\n\nSure, there are also the monstrous zombies, the nightmarish flying locusts, and the fallen skies.  Yes, there is also the requisite damsel-in-distress (and love interest) who captures Imhotep&apos;s heart.  The venomous super-villain who must eat the flesh of others in order to survive is a plus as well.  However, director Stephen Sommers (DEEP RISING) transcends beyond cliché material.  He brings to the audience original ideas with a refreshingly cool tone.  He makes sure that there is style within the special effects.  The eye-popping FX in general will keep crowds contented, and then some.\n\nIt is tough to keep a straight face when watching this movie, but you have to praise Sommers and the cast for letting you have so much fun.  Yes, the dialogue is indeed ridiculous as for some of the sequences.  One scene that had me chuckling throughout was when all the slaves were synchronically chanting &quot;Imhotep!&quot;  Kevin J. O&apos;Connor finds himself having some of the best one-liners as he may eventually switch allegiances and serve a different master.  Yes, the humor is somewhat gratuitous, granted.  However, in all sincerity, the humor is needed to lighten the film&apos;s dark tone.\n\nThe acting is more second rate.  Arnold Vosloo made a terrific villain and Rachel Weisz lights up the screen with her gorgeous presence.  Fraser and O&apos;Connor are great also.  The rest of the cast is kind of listless though. In spite of that, THE MUMMY is a spectacular spectacle laced with show-stopping special effects and genuine chills.  The music, composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith is pulse pounding and excellent.  The orchestration is wonderful during this film&apos;s every thread of suspense.\n\nOverall, THE MUMMY is one of the best blockbusters of 1999.  Nonstop thrills and surprises galore highlight this enthusiastic, fun-filled entertainment. THE MUMMY has lots of fun and excitement.  The only flaw that prevents this film from being a full fledged four star movie is its occasional lapses in credibility and coherence.  At times, this film is extremely ludicrous, but who cares, its fanatically fun to watch.  Genre fans, take note.\n\nRemember, you cannot keep the dead buried forever...\n\nRATING: ***1/2 out of ****."

      "name": "Strong contender for best movie of 2009",
      "reviewBody": "Quite easily the best movie of 2009 and the best war movie since Black Hawk Down and maybe even beyond that, The Hurt Locker does something that few other war movies seem to be able to do. Rather than focusing on rapid-action combat scenes and the oh-so-emotional mental breakdowns that all soldiers seem to dramatically endure in Hollywood (Platoon, much?), it emphasizes the relationships of soldiers and the intensity of everyday living in Iraq– intensity that doesn&apos;t diminish when the guns are holstered. And that&apos;s where you&apos;ll see the real difference.\n\nThe film introduces a seemingly new and unique idea by following a U.S. Army Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) team as they go around defusing potential bombs all around town– a concept that allows the typical fast-action war theme to take a backseat to the dramatic intensity of the three team members&apos; escapades and arguments. It&apos;s all about survival and this time around, it&apos;s the calm, isolated atmosphere and the feeling of never being truly safe that creates the ever-present suspense. The exceptional editing is partially to thank for such constant energy and pace. Quick transitions ensure that there is never a dull moment and the audience is always thrust into the middle of the action. Plus, director Kathryn Bigelow employed some amazing cinematography (thanks to Barry Ackroyd, United 93) and some of the best shaky hand-held-cam and zoom work I&apos;ve seen yet. It seems that, for some, this might be a turn-off, but personally, I believe those who complain about shaky cam need to take a closer look at its purpose and realize that it&apos;s far more effective in establishing a documentary-like feel for raw and engaging films such as this one.\n\nThe interaction between the soldiers is a key point of the film and the entire project is clearly intended to be largely character-driven. You will more than likely find yourself sympathizing with all of the main characters at some point and several others along the way. More than just observing a character&apos;s breakdown at the scene of war such as in films like Jarhead, The Hurt Locker immerses the viewer in the world of the characters themselves and practically forces you to care for them– and I mean that in the best way possible. And perhaps the difference is also partially distinguished by the quality of acting. And if there&apos;s anyone who deserves recognition for their acting, it&apos;s most certainly Jeremy Renner, who surprises with a top-notch performance as Staff Sergeant William James. His performance will have you laughing at bits of humor scattered throughout, gasping in disbelief at one point, shedding a sympathetic tear at another, and yelling at him in exasperation in yet another scene. The characters are never two-dimensional and the film always manages to provide constant reminders that all of the soldiers are just normal people in war situations, driving its purpose home even more effectively. Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are impressive in their own roles and share great chemistry both with each other and with Renner. The relationships between the three follow no stereotyped guidelines and their interactions are almost always unpredictable. Further down the billing, Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes also give solid performances worth mentioning.\n\nOverall, The Hurt Locker is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and packs a visual and cinematographic punch without the over-the-top Hollywood action scenes and special effects. While the storyline may be inaccurate when it comes to certain little details (as many war vets have noted), it&apos;s a unique one and allows for much more realistic and well-rounded characters. You&apos;ll walk away with your heart still beating fast for a good while after the credits roll and it&apos;ll make you think for an even further extended period of time. Everything about its design and execution will stick with you.\n\n--The Motion Picture Underground",

Particularly Daniel Craig&apos;s lead. He felt like an eccentric, but brilliant, detective in Knives Out, but here he just comes off as silly. His complete inaction toward the end seems to exist only to set up the ridiculous, over-the-top ending. Also, Kathryn Hahn and Leslie Odom. Jr. Are so wasted that I don&apos;t know why they even signed on for this. Glass Onion was an okay distraction for a Netflix movie, but I would have been annoyed if I&apos;d paid to see this in a theater.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot; is one of the most creative, fresh and original films I have seen in ages, and because of that I was in absolute awe of the film. However, despite being a terrific film, I also understand that this is NOT a film that will appeal to everyone--in fact, it&apos;s probably one of the more polarizing films I have ever seen--you&apos;ll probably either love it or hate it. While I am NOT in the target demographic group (aged 15-30 and predisposed to loving graphic novels AND video games), I did enjoy it--and am probably the rare 40-something person who loved the film. What was different about me is that I am a geek (a definite plus), enjoy video games and have a rabid comic book fan for a daughter--so I understood many of the pop culture references throughout the film. But, if you are NOT a geek, hate video games and see graphic novels more as comic books, then the movie might be a chore to watch. Plus you might just feel ooky hanging out with geeks. Don&apos;t worry, they are almost all very nice people! \n\nSo what, other than originality, did I love about this film? Well, just about everything--and I seriously considered giving the film a 10--I liked it that much. Perhaps the best thing for me was casting of Michael Cera in the lead. Unlike the traditional super-hero, he is by far the geekiest and most likable main character I have seen. Seeing such a wimpy and unassuming guy become, out of no where, like a character from Mortal Combat was a wonderful juxtaposition--you just couldn&apos;t help but smile. And, despite his nerdy looks, he was winning as Scott Pilgram...and actually played the music his on-screen band played--now that&apos;s talent. Additionally, I loved the film&apos;s gentle sense of humor---I laughed harder at this film than any film I&apos;ve seen in the theater in some time. I could try to describe these moments--you just need to see them for yourself. Odd references to games like DOA, Mortal Combat, Marvel Vs. Capcom and Zelda II were great--I caught on to those due to my own geeky background. And, my familiarity with anime/manga also made me laugh--as the hair, love for girls in school uniforms and style were often straight out of Japanese comics. And, I loved how the film made me love video games and was simply much, much more fun that the original &quot;Tron&quot; (which I always felt was too dry--perhaps the new version will correct this).\n\nClever, wonderful and strange, this film is the geek&apos;s dream come true...and not a film to be missed. However, if you aren&apos;t a geek or are perhaps too old to get the pop references, I say take along an interpreter--many comic book nerds and couch potatoes would be glad to go with you and help explain things...provided you pay for the tickets.\n\nAmong the nearly 9000 reviews I have now done on IMDb, this ranks in the hallowed ranks of a very small group of movies that transcended the pack due to its utter weirdness. It&apos;s surreal and weird--and I think this makes it very special. For other films that fall into this category, try &quot;The Happiness of the Katikuris&quot;, &quot;Delicatessen&quot;, &quot;Yes Nurse, No Nurse&quot;, &quot;Tatie Danielle&quot; and &quot;Tampopo&quot;--all truly unique, surreal and fabulous films.",

      "reviewBody": "Quantum of Solace or Quantum so less, as some of its critics may call it, definitely lacks certain aspects of a traditional Bond movie. It may be eccentric in the sense that it may not be able to titillate the esoteric Bond fans as it may lack their eclectic style and taste but it definitely succeeds in projecting a new Bond for the contemporary world who may not be a coeval of a superhero, who despite being vulnerable has got the killer instinct in him, which is the very defining characteristic of Ian Fleming&apos;s larger than life human incarnate. This Bond goes about his business in a fashion which is far more realistic compared to the Bond of the bygone era with an incredible passion and utmost devotion which is nothing but inexorable. Though Casino Royale was the pioneer of this graduation but its Quantum of Solace that consummates it and gives Fleming&apos;s agent a mystique which has always eluded him hitherto, an aura which gives him an opportunity to be mortal and hence a chance to qualify to be called a human.\n\nQuantum of Solace is loaded with mind blowing action sequences which makes it a high octane extravaganza. The pace of the movie is such that you hardly get time to breathe freely. The plot though comparatively weaker than its precursor, is still good enough to keep one guessing thereby keeping one at the edge of the seat, all the way through. \n\nThe only aspect of the movie which should be under the scanner is its editing which is far from just and at times needless and severely annoying. A bit constraint editing under some meticulous vigilance could have done wonders and would have probably helped it, in its quest to be the best Bond movie of all time. \n\nAll being said and given what we have, the movie fails to disappoint the audience and will surely redefine the very prerequisites of an action movie and will definitely serve as a benchmark for the movies in the years to come.\n\nhttp://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",

      "reviewBody": "I think 2012 has been a very good, even great, year for animation in that I don&apos;t think I have seen an animated film I&apos;ve disliked. Wreck It Ralph for me was the best animated film from 2012(although it only came out yesterday in the UK I still class it as a 2012 film), tying with Tangled as the best Disney has done since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It has something for children and adults alike, and I don&apos;t think you have to be a video game fan to like it(I&apos;m not exactly, more of Disney myself, but am very familiar with them through my brother). The animation is wonderful, the characters move with no problem at all, the colours look gorgeous and the backgrounds are detailed, very like the very best of Pixar actually. The music, right from the tempos, rhythms, melodies, chord progressions and instrumentation, is full of energy and the songs are incredibly catchy. The writing is a perfect blend of humour and heart, the film is often hilarious and witty as well as heartfelt and touching in equal measures and the story is fast-paced and much more original than you&apos;d think complete with energetic-but not too frantic- action. I like the Be Youself message, it is an important one and I personally didn&apos;t think it was heavy-handed. And of course any video game fan will love spotting the video game characters and references, there&apos;s plenty of them and all are colourfully evoked. I found it very easy to relate to Ralph, Fix-it Felix Jr is an amusing character and Vanellope is cute without being annoying or mawkish. The voice work is terrific, with the standout being the gruff vulnerability that John C Reilly brings to Ralph. In conclusion, a wonderful film and the best animated film of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

      "name": "One of the most effortlessly enjoyable action movies of the 80s",
      "reviewBody": "31 years after its original release, it&apos;s hard to believe that there was once a time when John McTiernan&apos;s Predator wasn&apos;t revered as one of the best action movies of the modern era. Critics savaged the film, although now even the stuffiest of critics cannot deny its shamelessly muscly, bullet-spraying, blood-spattering charm. Predator is now held in as equally high regard as McTiernan&apos;s other action classic Die Hard - released the following year - and featured Arnold Schwarzenegger at the very top of his game. This was long before the Austrian hulk made a swerve into politics and became the self-parody he is today. The premise is almost offensively simple, but the execution makes this one of the most effortlessly enjoyable action movies of the 1980s. McTiernan knows exactly how to tear a jungle apart with gunfire, and set up his disposable supporting characters for a grisly death.\n\nSpecial Forces major Dutch Schaefer (Schwarzenegger) is &quot;choppahed&quot; into South America, where is he given a mission to rescue an official who has fallen into the hands of some insurgents. Schaefer and his team - played by Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Sonny Landham, Richard Chaves and Shane Black - are met by Schaefer&apos;s old Army buddy Dillon (Carl Weathers), and the two greet each other in the most 80s way possible by flexing their oiled and oversized muscles in a manly handshake. As the team venture further into the jungle, it becomes clear that Dillon isn&apos;t telling the whole story, and the mission becomes even more difficult when they capture a female hostage named Anna (Elpidia Carrillo). Yet this is far from their biggest problem, as on their tail is an alien with the ability to camouflage itself and see with thermal imaging, backed by an arsenal of powerful extra-terrestrial gadgets and a healthy appetite for the hunt. With the group being picked off one by one by this formidable enemy, Schaefer must get to the extraction point before he becomes another skull in the beast&apos;s growing collection of trophies.\n\nThe plot can be compared to countless B-movies throughout the years, but what worked for Alien also works for Predator. Take a simple premise, add some budget, bind it together with some good old-fashioned decent film-making, and the result is a timeless classic. Yes, the special effects have dated and most of the actors&apos; stars have somewhat dimmed in the decades since, but Predator is even more of a blast now than it was when I stole my brother&apos;s VHS twenty-odd years ago. The sequels, spin-offs and comic-books have gone to great length to explain and develop the Predator&apos;s mythology, but McTiernan simply lets the monster do its thing. Played by the 7 ft 2 in Kevin Peter Hall, the Predator&apos;s formidable armour, weaponry, stealth and sheer repulsiveness has made it a sci-fi/horror icon. Like the Alien franchise, subsequent movies have felt the need to explain the creature&apos;s backstory, damaging their otherworldly mystery in the process, but Predator simply throws him into the mix and lets him loose on our world&apos;s finest warriors. With star Shane Black&apos;s reboot The Predator set to arrive shortly, now is the perfect time to revisit what drew audiences to the series in the first place, in spite of how your attitude may have soured after those terrible Alien cross-overs and the forgettable third entry from 2010.",

      "reviewBody": "First off, let me get something out of the way here: I like to be entertained. Entertainment, as we all know, comes in different shapes and sizes; it can be smart, profound, intellectually stimulating and so forth – or it can just be escapist fun. Now what kind of entertainment you expect from a James Bond film is up to you; as for me, I go with fun. Regrettably, the last three 007 instalments fell a bit short in that department (at least for my taste), and since I expected this new film to be more of the same, I didn&apos;t exactly get my hopes up. \n\nWell, I can only say I was pleasantly surprised (although judging from most reviews here, I seem to be in the minority). Instead of further exploring the somewhat dark, dramatic route the previous three films took - which, I must admit, worked very well in Casino Royale - Spectre unexpectedly goes in the exact opposite direction. Sam Mendes and John Logan apparently came to the conclusion that it was time to bring back one of the most crucial ingredients for Bond&apos;s success with audiences over the years: the fun.\n\nDon&apos;t get me wrong; it&apos;s not suddenly ALL fun and games for Her Majesty&apos;s finest spy (and Craig still portrays him as a character driven by inner rage) - but the new film is a virtual celebration of the whole James Bond universe, from past to present, including the less grounded and over-the-top elements from the older films. In fact, after a stand-out intro sequence in classic fashion, the spy with a license to kill takes us on a ride which - tonally - feels like travelling back in time to the glory days of such classics as You Only Live Twice, Goldfinger or From Russia With Love (and it&apos;s a ride back in time in more senses than one).\n\nThis is supposed to be a spoiler-free review, so I won&apos;t go into any of the story details, but what unfolds after the introduction plays like a combination of the more grounded, serious Bond we&apos;ve come to associate with Daniel Craig&apos;s films, and the more self-aware spy-romps of the Roger Moore era. It&apos;s a mix that doesn&apos;t always work and tone and pacing can be a bit uneven at times (especially during the third act), but Spectre largely succeeds in paying homage to many of the classic Bond films while still delivering the gritty action people come to expect from the newer instalments and staying true to the character Craig has so successfully made his own. And despite all the references and callbacks to classic 007 adventures, Spectre still manages to continue the storyline of the three previous films. So while his second entry in the world&apos;s longest living franchise is far from a perfect film, I believe Sam Mendes achieves exactly what he wants: he intentionally embraces the old Bond formula, but he also plays with it, twists it and introduces new story elements. \n\nSo my verdict: Spectre is a love letter to the classic Bond films, and while it might not be the masterpiece many people seem to have expected, there is a lot to enjoy here. It&apos;s a solid, almost classic Bond film with insane action, great set-pieces and a fantastic cast; upon first viewing, I&apos;d rate it 7 stars out of 10.\n\nRare Film Gems For Cinephiles: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s honestly absurd how good the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; movies are. &quot;Across the Spider-Verse&quot; is just as great, if not better than &quot;Into the Spider-Verse&quot;. I really don&apos;t know how. &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen&apos;s story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham&apos;s Captain Stacy are truly special.\n\nCan&apos;t wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn&apos;t want to blink because I didn&apos;t want to miss anything. You can watch this film over &amp; over &amp; finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn&apos;t expecting.\n\n&quot;Across the Spider-Verse&quot; is another milestone for animation. Yes it&apos;s gorgeous &amp; visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen&apos;s story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it&apos;s visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie&apos;s real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.\n\nWhat more can I say...It&apos;s an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It&apos;s outstanding. &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It&apos;s darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary.",

      "name": "In the shadow of Blomkamp&apos;s District 9",
      "reviewBody": "ELYSIUM is a bitter-sweet social commentary that uses brutal allegories to reiterate the alarming rate at which socio-economic and geo-political ties are disintegrating all over the planet. As a follow up to the thought provoking and thoroughly entertaining DISTRICT 9 (2009), South African writer-director Neill Blomkamp&apos;s latest offering is yet another visionary parable to mull over. And while the first half is a frightening impression of the future of humanity, the second half feels rushed and diluted. Even so, the film has a lot to offer in terms of visual effects and explosive action.\n\nAlthough Blomkamp&apos;s narrative begins in a dystopian future set in 2154, the story has a modern day setting that uses current events in cleverly hidden metaphors. Consider the following facts: The French Revolution that led to the execution of the monarchy; Derogatory sentiments deriding Android phones as &quot;ghetto&quot; products; Fatalities of illegal immigrants on route to greener pastures; The prospect of space tourism that only the super-rich can afford. Now imagine in the not too distant future, the extremely wealthy live on a pristine space station where state-of-the-art health care prevents people from premature death. The remaining ninety-nine percent of the population are left to suffer on the diseased, polluted and over populated planet we call Earth. Thus begins Blomkamp&apos;s setup where the premise is a thematic and often desperate struggle for equality. Amongst Earth&apos;s &apos;ghetto&apos; population, blue-collar worker Max Da Costa (Matt Damon) has always dreamt of shortening the ever widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. Now diseased and dying, the only means of rejuvenating his health lies aboard the titular space station. But preventing Max from leaving Earth is Elysium&apos;s iron-fisted Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and her rogue agent - the terrifying and almost psychotic Kruger (Sharlto Copley). \n\nWhere Blomkamp excels is in presenting a bleak scenario that is not only plausible but also discomforting. Considering the real world disparity between man-made utopias and an unfed infant in so called &apos;third world countries&apos;, it becomes all the more unsettling that this story is not entirely make believe. This is precisely what gives ELYSIUM a powerful yet thought provoking backdrop. All else, from gritty action sequences to the CGI built paradise in space benefits from the current going rate in Hollywood. On the other hand, character development leaves much to be desired. Two-time Academy Award winning Foster is either miscast or given very little to work with, but definitely my biggest disappointment in this film. There is simply no punch in what appears to be her first antagonistic role. Foster shares this downside with William Fichtner, another underrated actor whose talents are wasted in what should have been a key role. Thankfully, Damon and Copley make up for any noticeable lapse in the acting department. Together, their characters portray the fickle polarity of the human nature while also providing the film&apos;s testosterone fuelled action, including scenes of intense shootouts and sudden blood splatter. \n\nIn a year that coughed up quite a few sci-fi films, with some even treading into apocalyptic territory, ELYSIUM stands on firm ground as a film that tackles social issues head-on. And while this film is far from perfect, there are ample reasons why this film is still worth a trip to the cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "For those who might not know the name, director Martin McDonagh is an Irish playwright who won the Oscar last year for his short film &quot;Six Shooter&quot; about a chance encounter on a train, and that film&apos;s star Brendan Gleeson has returned as Ken, one of two hit men sent to the medieval city of Bruges in Belgium along with his partner Ray (Colin Farrell) to rest and lay low after a hit gone horribly wrong. Ray is a miserable bastard who makes it clear he&apos;s not happy about being in Bruges, but Ken convinces him that their boss Harry has a job for them there, as well as allowing them a chance for some sightseeing, none of which improves Ray&apos;s mood. Things look up when he meets the beautiful local woman Chloe, played by French actress Clémence Poésy--you may remember her as Fleur Delacore in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire--and scores himself a date, which also goes horribly wrong due to Ray shooting off his big mouth. From there things continue to go south as Ray and Ken get into all sorts of messes and meet strange characters, all of whom will play a part in the larger picture.\n\nThere aren&apos;t too many non-Belgian films set in Belgium, and Bruges is a beautiful but odd place to set an entire movie. You&apos;ll probably learn more about the place than you ever need to know as Ken narrates their sightseeing excursions with a few factoids about the place. The entire first act is driven by the chemistry between Farrell and Gleason as they deliver rapid-fire patter that reminds one of McDonagh&apos;s background as a playwright, but it makes them as immediately endearing as Vincent and Jules in &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; allowing for an even bigger impact as things happen to them. Our first encounter with the boys&apos; boss Harry is an expletive filled telegraph and an equally amusing phone conversation with Ken, making it obvious that this is a mobster cut from the same cloth as Ben Kingsley&apos;s Don Logan. Those who don&apos;t recognize the voice will be thrilled when they learn who plays Harry, because it&apos;s a pleasant surprise.\n\nThis is easily Colin Farrell&apos;s best role and performance in a long time, one that allows him to show a lot of range, not just as the big-mouthed prat we assume Ray to be, but also as a thoughtful man distraught about what happened in London. Having seen the error of his ways, he feels the need to make right, even if he hides it with a lot of complaining and arguments, and that carries over to Gleason&apos;s Ken, continuing his great run with McDonagh.\n\nMcDonagh has created a clever script that interweaves its small cast of characters into an intricate crime caper that mixes humor, violence and true heartfelt human emotions into a brilliant debut feature. Just when you think you know where things are going, McDonagh throws a sharp curve ball at you and then another, and another, and pretty soon, what started as a two-handed talkie has turned into a hold-your-breath action flick, when Harry turns up in Bruges to rectify some business that Ken has botched. Even so, it never loses what made the first half so charming and entertaining, because McDonagh&apos;s impressive dialogue remains at the forefront for the extended confrontation between Ken and Harry. The ending might be somewhat grim for some tastes going by the lightness of what&apos;s gone before, but the way everything is tied together makes it all worth it.\n\nAnyone worried that Tarantino and Ritchie&apos;s best work might be behind them, can revel in the promise of McDonagh&apos;s take on the crime-comedy genre, as this talented filmmaker shows that &quot;Six Shooter&quot; was no fluke and this movie begins what&apos;s likely to be a long and promising film career. On top of that, if &quot;In Bruges&quot; doesn&apos;t end up being the funniest and most quotable movies of the year, then it should be very close",

      "reviewBody": "En Sabah Nur is Apocalypse, the first mutant who ruled ancient Egypt until he was entombed. It&apos;s the 80&apos;s. CIA agent Moira MacTaggert goes to Egypt and witnesses his emergence. He recruits his four horsemen Magneto, Storm, Psylocke, and Angel giving them greater power. Meanwhile, Raven recruits Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler from an East Berlin fight club. Alex Summers brings his younger brother Scott to Professor Charles Xavier&apos;s school. Quicksilver arrives at the school just in time to rescue almost everybody from an explosion but Professor X is kidnapped by Apocalypse.\n\nI really like the first half. There are some good introduction of the new characters. It&apos;s working fine for the most part. It hits the pinnacle with Quicksilver&apos;s rescue which is funny and exciting. It is visually dynamic and a joy to behold. The rest of the movie feels like a long slow slide into mediocrity.\n\nThe most troubling problem for the continuing franchise is the use of Mystique as the leading X-Men. That character has never been in that role. JLaw is struggling to put out the intensity to match the central part. She and her character is not up to the task so far. It&apos;s also funny that her powers is to not be JLaw. The other problem is Apocalypse. I hoped for better but his mega-destruction is underwhelming. It&apos;s a lot of bland and his powers are nebulous. I actually think it would have been better to allow Apocalypse to be a two-parter. As an one-and-done villain, he isn&apos;t allowed to be anything more than a monster of the moment. With a lower level of power from him, it could be more compelling to struggle for the soul of each horseman. As it stands, the character Apocalypse is nothing special.",

The concept is a great one, and it poses a fabulous question, could you force someone to spend their life with you, or live a solitary life. The idea is very original and very clever, the special effects are breathtaking, and the cinematography is first class. The main trio of actors do a superb job, but it&apos;s the dazzling Jennifer Lawrence that stood out for me.\n\nAttention to the detail to this film was first rate, huge credit to all those behind the scenes.\n\nIt&apos;s not often the case that I wish a film wouldn&apos;t end, but after fifteen minutes or so, I was captivated, and really didn&apos;t want it to end.\n\nFabulous film, 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "After Avengers: Infinity War I was worried that anything that would come after for Marvel would be underwhelming but I was wrong because AntMan and the wasp used the same formula as the last Ant man movie which was that it was a small story and a family oriented story inside a superhero movie.\n\nThe Whole premise is Janet Van Dym Hank Pym&apos;s wife is trying to get saved from the Quantam while AntMan is underhouse arrest.The story was simple enough and built Aroundt which is why it was so good.\n\nThe first act was a tad slow but not boring is it set up where the characters are and had some fun action especially with the introduction of the Wasp.The second act was a kind of boring with the pace diping and nothing exciting happening.The third act picked up the pace and the chunk of the action was in the last 30 minutes so that was my favorite part.The villain or antagonist of the movie Ghost wasn&apos;t bad but not really that interesting she has a reason to be there but didn&apos;t add anything significant with the plot expect for fancy powers which made for good effects.Michael Douglas&apos; performance amd Pual Rudd were the best characters in the movie as they were serious when needed to be and funny when needed to be.The Wasp as I said was cool with as a good enough performance from lilly.Michelle Pfeiffer did well in the role she was given and had good chemistry in the scenes she had with Michael Douglas.\n\nAntman and the Wasp was funnier than the first one but of course its Marvel but It had some out of place humor that took away from the serious moments but of course again its Marvel.This had more action as well but mainly in the last 40 minutes or so because as I said the second act was mostly slow and kind of dragged on.\n\nSo what to take away from all of this is that Antman and the wasp is similar to Back to the Future its funny,has a story with a heart and just a plain fun blockbuster.",

What makes this film unique is how it uses the tropes for its narrative purpose.\n\nI personally, would move or remove some of the scenes in the first act to give the movie a sense of mystery. There is a lot of scenes with a certain duo that I feel would have been better introduced in the second act. That way the first act feels more like a cliche horror movie because it gets completely flipped on its head in the second act. Apart from that, I find this to be a throughly enjoyable film!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; (2008), directed by Ben Stiller, is a satirical comedy that brilliantly skewers the film industry, celebrity culture, and the absurdities of war movies. The film boasts an ensemble cast, including Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., and Jack Black, who deliver hilarious performances, elevating the movie to cult classic status.\n\nOne of the standout features of &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; is its meta-narrative. The film follows a group of self-absorbed actors who find themselves in a real-life jungle war zone while filming a war movie. Stiller&apos;s portrayal of the narcissistic action star Tugg Speedman, Downey Jr.&apos;s method actor Kirk Lazarus, and Black&apos;s over-the-top comedian Jeff Portnoy create a trio of memorable characters, each a caricature of Hollywood archetypes.\n\nDowney Jr.&apos;s performance is particularly noteworthy, as he plays a white actor who undergoes surgery to darken his skin for a role, adding a layer of satire that addresses issues of race and cultural appropriation in Hollywood. The film cleverly navigates these sensitive topics through its comedic lens, sparking both laughter and reflection.\n\nThe screenplay, written by Stiller, Justin Theroux, and Etan Cohen, is filled with witty dialogue and clever humor. The film&apos;s self-awareness and willingness to lampoon Hollywood conventions contribute to its comedic success. The over-the-top action sequences and absurd situations parody the clichés often found in war films, creating a comedic commentary on the genre.\n\n&quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; also benefits from its supporting cast, including Tom Cruise in an unrecognizable and hilarious role as the eccentric studio executive Les Grossman. Cruise&apos;s performance is a scene-stealer, adding an extra layer of comedic brilliance to the film.\n\nThe cinematography captures the chaos of the jungle setting, and the use of practical effects in the action sequences adds to the film&apos;s authenticity while maintaining its comedic tone. The soundtrack, featuring classic rock hits, complements the humor and enhances the overall viewing experience.\n\nIn conclusion, &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; is a sharp and irreverent satire that lampoons Hollywood excesses and war movie conventions. With a stellar ensemble cast, clever writing, and a willingness to tackle controversial subjects, the film remains a standout comedy that continues to entertain audiences with its humor and social commentary.",

      "reviewBody": "From the way the critics have gone after &quot;The Da Vinci Code,&quot; you&apos;d think that Ron Howard himself had been jealously guarding the location of the Holy Grail all these years and was just now revealing it to all the world for his own nefarious (i.e. commercial) purposes. Actually, despite all the critical hostility and rancor, this turns out to be a reasonably entertaining adaptation of a reasonably entertaining novel, far from a classic or a work of art, but hardly the pile of cinematic refuse so many of the reviewers have led us to believe it is.\n\nAs a work of history, the novel is a passel of nonsense, and only those with a bent towards conspiracy theory overload would be foolish enough to believe a minute of it. But as a work of imaginative fiction, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; certainly gives its audience the neck-twisting workout they&apos;ve paid good money to receive.\n\nIt would be pointless to reiterate the plot of a novel that has probably had the biggest readership of any literary work since &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot; Suffice it to say that a mysterious murder in the Louvre sends a Harvard symbologist and the dead man&apos;s granddaughter on a clue-driven search for the famed Holy Grail. Along the way, the two uncover a grand conspiracy on the part of a renegade Catholic order to protect a secret that, if it were revealed, could shake the whole of Western civilization down to its very foundations.\n\nDespite the phenomenal - one is tempted to say &quot;unprecedented&quot; - commercial success of his work, Dan Brown is no great shakes as a writer; his characters are, almost without exception, drab and two-dimensional, and his dialogue, when it isn&apos;t being overly explicit in pouring out explanations, sounds like it was written by a first-year student in a Writer&apos;s 101 workshop. But the one undeniable talent Brown does have is his ability to knit together a preposterously complex web of codes and clues into an airtight tapestry, and to make it all convincing.\n\nThe movie is very faithful to the novel in this respect. It moves quickly from location to location, never giving us too much time to question the logic (or illogic) of the narrative or to examine the many gaping plot holes in any great detail. Writer Akiva Goldsman has encountered his greatest trouble in the scenes in which the action stops dead in its tracks so that the characters can lay out in laborious detail the elaborate story behind the clues. Yet, this is as much the fault of the nature and design of the novel as it is of the man given the unenviable task of bringing it to the screen. Moreover, perhaps in the interest of time and keeping the action flowing, Robert and Sophie come up with solutions to the myriad riddles much too quickly and accurately, with a &quot;Golly, gee, could it mean_______?&quot; attitude that borders on the ludicrous. But, somehow, Howard makes most of it work. Perhaps, it&apos;s the clunky literal-minded earnestness with which he approaches the subject that ultimately allows us to buy into it against our better judgment.\n\nTom Hanks is stolid and passive as Dr. Robert Langdon, the college professor involuntarily driven into all this cloak-and-dagger intrigue, but Audrey Tautou has a certain subtle charm as Sophie, the woman who may play more of a part in the unraveling of the mystery than even she herself can imagine. Jean Reno and Paul Bettany have their moments as two of the less savory players in the story, but it is Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on all things related to the Holy Grail, who walks off with the film. His scenery-chewing shtick pumps some much needed life into a tale essentially populated by underdeveloped stick figures.\n\nThe religious controversy surrounding both the novel and the film is as ludicrous as it is unjustified. Anyone whose belief system could be seriously shaken by this absurd mixture of unsubstantiated myth-making and plain old-fashioned wild speculation couldn&apos;t have had a very solid foundation of faith to begin with.\n\nThe rest of us can appreciate &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; for what it is, an overblown but epic exercise in code-busting and clue-decoding - in short, the &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; of whodunits.",

      "reviewBody": "What&apos;s that you say? Ghostbusters, one of the most financially successful and over-hyped comedies of the eighties, underrated? Yes. Precicely because it was so over-hyped and made so much money, there has been a stigma attached to this film identifying it as a childish FX piece, when it is nothing of the sort. Most of the lines people remember(&quot;He slimed me,&quot; &quot;OK. So? She&apos;s a dog,&quot; &quot;When someone asks you if you&apos;re a god, you say YES!&quot;) are not its funniest or wittiest lines, which often are missed on first or even second viewing. I laugh every time I observe a gag or a quip that I somehow missed the other 20 times I viewed a scene; &quot;Egon, this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole through your head, remember that?&quot; &quot;That would have worked if you hadn&apos;t stopped me&quot;, or, to the driver of a van from a loony bin, &quot;Dropping off or picking up?&quot; Brilliant.\n\nNot only is Ghostbusters funny, it manages to include some truly scary scenes. And not just lose-your-popcorn moments like the fridge from Hell, but also scenes of quiet, thoughtful chill, like Egon&apos;s retelling of how the possessed apartment building came into being, or Winston recalling the Book of Revelation. Which other film has managed to combine the Marx Brothers with HP Lovecraft?\n\nThe special effects hold up well, besides some obvious studio sets and models, but what really creates this film&apos;s world is the stunning cinematography. Manhattan, perhaps the pinnacle of Gothic architectural evolution, is brilliantly utilised here to create a sense of menacing grandeur. After watching &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; I couldn&apos;t imagine the realm of the Old Gods opening into our world from anywhere else. The soundtrack is great, not the overrated theme (Which was in fact lifted from Huey Lewis&apos; &quot;I Need a New Drug&quot;), but the wonderfully blusey &quot;Cleaning Up the Town,&quot; the creepy proto-techno chiller &quot;Magic&quot; and also the wonderful score by the late and much lamented Elmer Bernstein.",

Shang-Chi is a pretty standard hero&apos;s journey at its core, which is a shame because the story could have been inspired by House of Flying Daggers and other wuxia titles.\n\nSo why a rating so high? Because where the story falls, everything else excels.\n\nShang-Chi is visually spectacular and a real treat for the eyes with some visuals that are incredibly distinct for the MCU. In regards to aesthetics, Black Panther walked so Shang-Chi could run a marathon.\n\nThe fight scenes are all amazing. There&apos;s one weak fight, but it&apos;s meant to be weak, and they&apos;re all very long, which is great to see. One of the early ones went on for a solid 5 - 10 minutes, which was unexpected but far from disappointing.\n\nThe first actual fight scene is my favourite in the MCU, and I was worried none of the others would top it, but they were all delightful to watch, and I was so glad they did a parallel of it later on. Either way, the writers went hard on the fight scenes and that paid off.\n\nIn summary, the story is lacking, but I&apos;m glad in a way because that allowed everything else to shine. And shine, it did. I hope future directors take lessons from the aesthetics and choreography of Shang-Chi.",

      "reviewBody": "Nice try, but the satire doesn&apos;t land in this film that skewers pretentious foodies and the chefs who cook for them.\n\nThere&apos;s already been one satire this year that savages the rich, &quot;Triangle of Sadness,&quot; and that&apos;s a much better film than this one. I&apos;m ok with an outlandish premise, but if you&apos;re going to give me one, then the rules within the world of the movie have to be consistent. In this film, characters act like they&apos;re in a realistic horror movie one minute and a goofy satire the next. The tone doesn&apos;t stick to one or the other, so what was probably intended to be cutting instead falls flat.\n\nThe ending especially is silly. It definitely did not leave me wanting s&apos;more.\n\nGrade: C+",

      "reviewBody": "This is a really cool idea for a film. A day in the future when the commodity of value is not cash or gold, it is time. Everyone gets to live to age 25. After that you have one year to live, or less. It all depends upon whether you use all your time credits or you earn more. Regardless, if you live to age 100, or longer, your body physically remains looking twenty five.\n\nOn the plus side is Justin Timberlake coming back and showing that his misstep in Bad Teacher (2011) was just one of those embarrassing Hollywood screw ups. Timberlake has real drama and acting talent and is definitely here for the long haul. (Too bad Elvis was never given such chances.) Timberlake gave us a glimpse of his depth last year in The Social Newtwork (2010) , but his talents were not fully developed for Friends with Benefits (2011). \n\nThe script starts with the eerie, sobering reminder, and all too familiar words, &quot;We don&apos;t have time...we don&apos;t have time...&quot; Think if today you had to buy everything with time, instead of bank credit or cash. Coffee costs four minutes. A bus ride costs an hour. A car costs two years. People can give or take time from each other. Just don&apos;t run out of time or you will die on the spot. If this were real, would you treasure and spend time more wisely? The real interesting question may be that time really is the currency we live by now, we just fail to see it that way. The simple fact is that you can earn countless piles of cash and gold in this world, but you really cannot buy time. Despite the wealthy in today&apos;s world sometimes being able to cheat a few years with better health care, we all are going to die in the same average years.\n\nWhile the script is the superficial tale of Will Salas (Timberlake) and his Mom (Wilde) trying to pass time in a futuristic world, the messages of the film go far deeper. It is really a tale of class warfare. People who have time, like the mega &quot;eonaire&quot; Phillipe Weis (Katheiser) and his rich daughter Sylvia (Seyfried) and those who constantly struggle to keep time (or run out of it) like the Salas family. Will gets the chance to move up into a better time zone thanks to a man who has just decided that after a hundred years or so, he prefers to &quot;time out.&quot; He leaves Will the prophetic warning &quot;Don&apos;t waste my time.&quot; How Will chooses to spend his time, for himself or for the benefit of all, is now the story.\n\nI really did not mind that the future depicted in this film was not futuristic looking and all the cars were vintage 1970&apos;s models with updated lighting and electric sounding motors. It saved a huge budget rather than try to make the world look like it probably will in 2013 or so. And I think the point was that the future is really now.\n\nAs an entertaining film, my 7.5 rating is spot on. As a thought provoking experience, I might have given it a 10.0. After seeing this film, you should go out and visit with friends. Your own clock is ticking down. Are you really using it wisely? Unlike the time down clock on the arm of the people in this film, you never know when your time is about up.\n\nThis film...it&apos;s worth your time."

His adversary does the unexpected-and what most villains in real life WOULD do under the same circumstances, with hilarious results in the scene.  Basil Rathbone probably whirled in his grave!\n\nNot by any means Citizen Kane (we already have one of those, anyway) but a champ in its weight class, with a perfect score, a fine script and good performances.  Far more true to the flavor of the original fairy tales that it spoofs than even the best of Disney&apos;s takes.  I loved it the first time I saw it and love it more now.  Well worth watching.

It&apos;s not that I can&apos;t think of anything original, but that others seem to have felt the exact same emotions as I did when watching this film.\n\nI saw this movie when I was about 12, 13, maybe 14 years old. So it didn&apos;t have the same nostalgic sense it had for so many. But what it did, was make me ache for those memories. I wanted (in the words of another reviewer) to be 12, and *that* cool. I wished I had been like that, that I had had friends like that, laughed like that, and had adventures like that.\n\nThe &apos;milk-money&apos; scene was probably one of my all-time favourite scenes in movie history. Up until I saw this movie I had never held much regard for River Phoenix, but the poignancy and sincerity which River added to the role of Chris Chambers touched me to the point of tears. I read in yet another review that in this scene, River was asked to think of a time when he had been hurt by an adult, and that even after the cameras stopped rolling, River sat there still, sobbing and hurting. And I felt every tear and heard every word as though I were there with Chris.\n\nThis movie made me laugh, cry, rejoice and fear with Chris, Gordie, Teddy and Vern. I loved the campfire scenes, and today I look back on my own childhood, and remember with a laugh the amazingly similar things I used to laugh and wonder about with my friends. I remember dreaming about being a writer and an actress, I remember standing up to bullies, I remember walking or riding with my friends, I remember being afraid, and crying onto a friend&apos;s shoulder.\n\nI guess what this movie does for everyone, is take them back in time, even though the situations may have been different, chances are you&apos;ll find the similarities, and remember with a smile that yes, your life was once *that* cool. In the words of Vern, &quot;a great time&quot;\n\nI especially loved the ending. That they found out who was strong, and who just talked tough. I loved the last scene with Chris and Gordie, and the closing monologue.\n\n&quot;I never had any friends later on, like the ones I had when I was twelve...Jesus....does anyone?&quot;"

    "summary": "Reviewers say 'Room' is a powerful film with strong performances, particularly from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. The movie delves into themes of captivity, motherhood, and isolation's psychological impact. Critics commend its emotional depth, cinematography, and Lenny Abrahamson's direction. Some find it slow or repetitive. The adaptation from Emma Donoghue's book is generally praised, though some feel it sugar-coats certain aspects. The mother-son relationship and their journey to freedom are central themes.",

      "name": "Awesome film - shame about the trailer",
      "reviewBody": "Room, based on the book by Emma Donoghue, starts on young Jack&apos;s 5th birthday. He gets a birthday cake from his mother (but no candles); a visit from his father; and a gift, albeit belatedly. This would all be perfectly normal except that all of this takes place within &apos;Room&apos; - a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for sex in the style of the dreadful real-life examples such as that perpetrated by Josef Fritzl in Austria. Jack is the (presumably) unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in &apos;TV land&apos; and unreal. Will Jack and Joy survive and ever see freedom again? \n\nAnd that&apos;s where I&apos;ll leave this synopsis, since (if you&apos;ve been lucky enough to avoid the trailer) there is a tense cat-and-mouse story to unfurl here.\n\nThis is an absorbing, although slow-moving, film that builds to some truly nail-biting moments. The screenwriter (also Donoghue) and director (Irishman Lenny &quot;Frank&quot; Abrahamson) are to be commended in keeping the story and drama really well-grounded and un-saccharined. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), the &apos;evil kidnapper&apos;, is not painted as some predictable monster: he is even portrayed to be kind and caring at some warped level. And there is no gratuitous sex: we are in effect seven years into the story and the abnormal is now completely normalised.\n\nThe film is told primarily from the viewpoint of Jack (Jacob Tremblay) but we also get under the skin of Joy (Brie Larson) and her emotions in trying to mentally deal with her ordeal. Looking at a picture of her with her school friends she bitterly comments that &quot;Nothing happened to them - - they just got on with their lives&quot;.\n\nThe acting is superb. I made the mistake of voting for John Boyega for the BAFTA Rising Star award before seeing this film (you can cast your vote here http://www.bafta.org/film/awards/ee-rising-star-award-in-2016). Not that Boyega isn&apos;t great, but Brie Larson really REALLY delivers here. She obviously won&apos;t give a hoot if she wins the Best Actress Oscar! And for me, for this award, she shines out in what I would perhaps see as one of this year&apos;s weaker Oscar categories. Jacob Tremblay is also exceptional as Jack - and it would be nice (rather than try to compare young performances with adult ones, as per Anna Paquin) if there was a special awards category for actors and actresses under 10. If there was, then Tremblay would storm it! You seriously forget that this is a child acting a part. He is totally connected to the role and these two core performances lock in your belief in the story.\n\nSupporting the cast are the ever reliable William H Macy as Joy&apos;s mentally tortured father, Joan Allen (Pamela Landy from the &quot;Bourne&quot; films) as her equally distraught mother and Sean Bridgers as the kidnapper.\n\nAt 2 hours long some of the scenes in the middle of the film made my attention waver a little. But my main criticism is in the trailer and marketing of the film. If ever there was a need for a true &apos;teaser trailer&apos; this is it. I never know who is responsible for putting trailers together - whether the director has the final say or whether its some nameless marketing bods in the distribution company, but whoever it is they should be taken out and &apos;given a good talking to&apos; for this travesty. It&apos;s like putting all of the twists in films like &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Gone Girl&quot; in their respective trailers. I&apos;ve gone so far as to create my own One Mann&apos;s Movies cut of the trailer, just for you good people, which I have included with my bob-the-movie-man.com version of this review.\n\nA leisurely, nuanced and effecting drama, this is not for fans of &quot;Die Hard&quot; or &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; fans. But for everyone else, this should be a must see.\n\nPlease visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.",

      "name": "Best Teen Movie since &apos;Clueless&apos;?",
      "reviewBody": "I have to admit that despite being a straight, 22 year old guy I have always had a weakness for teen films so I was looking forward to Lindsay Lohan&apos;s (who really impressed me in &apos;Freaky Friday&apos; and the much underrated &apos;Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen&apos;) latest.\n\nIt exceeded my expectations.\n\nLindsay is on great form, instantly likable as Cady and believable both as a regular girl and a &quot;regulation hottie&quot;. This girl is one of the best comic actresses of her generation and has created a fully rounded character it is difficult not to root for. Not that she carries the film alone.\n\nOf the adults Tim Meadows does sterling work in translating his character with relatively few lines. Neil Flynn (familiar as the Janitor from &apos;Scrubs&apos;) is even better with some great facial expressions as a father as much at sea in suburban America as his daughter. As for Tina Fey... a terrific performance of course and she is still as cute as she was on Saturday Night Live but where she really shines is in the screenplay which sounds real enough (at least for a teen film) and has some razor sharp areas (like Coach Carr&apos;s &apos;lessons&apos;).\n\nOf course the key group is the titular Mean Girls themselves - Regina (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) and Karen (Amanda Seyfried). Rachel McAdams creates a memorable High School tyrant, malicous, power mad and cruel but not entirely virtue free. She&apos;d screw you over in a heartbeat if you stepped on her turf, but the nonthreatening Gretchen is allowed some reward for loyalty. Gretchen herself, played by the delectable Lacey Chabert is a character of her own, not just a cardboard minion to follow orders. Neurotic, shallow, desperate, beautiful, loyal and rather uncertain she is perhaps the saddest and most sympathetic of the Plastics - a girl who certainly has the looks and money to make it to the top of the pyramid but who lacked the will or the certainty. Not a problem with Karen (Amanda Seyfried) who has an admirable certainty of herself and her abilities. In one of the films best lines after a telling off from Regina, Cady tries to comfort her:\n\nCady: You&apos;re not stupid, Karen. \n\nTo which Karen replies thoughtfully (without a hint of bitterness or anger):\n\nKaren: No, I am, actually. I&apos;m failing everything. \n\nIndeed she is. Karen is an airhead, and if not actively proud of it, at least accepting. She doesn&apos;t seem cruel herself, possibly because she is simply too shallow and dense, but she doesn&apos;t seem a bad person. Which for the second minion (Gretchen outranks her) to the villainous is quite a remarkable achievement.\n\nFinally I must mention Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Franzese as Janice and Damian respectively, the outsiders we are rooting for, in theory. They do good work, though I found them slightly dry next to the endlessly dysfunctional Plastics (though that may be something to do with me finding Lacey Chabert much more attractive than Daniel Franzese!)\n\nOverall a very good piece of work from all concerned. If you like teen movies then you&apos;ll find this a very good one. If you don&apos;t, well hold your nose and try it anyway, you might be pleasantly surprised!",

You may have to watch it a couple times to catch everything but you will fall in love with the characters and story every time you sit down to watch it\n\nAs for the art... Its Visually stunning yet again. Everything is depicted so well in Miyazaki&apos;s artwork from the humans to the Forest gods and everything in between\n\nthis definitely worth watching.\n\nAnd if you like it you should definitely check out some of his others like Castle In The Sky, Howls Moving Castle and Spirited Away",

I enjoyed it just as much as the first Jurassic Park. \n\nThe Lost World still contains impressive, eye popping effects. These are just as flawless as the CGI as the first Jurassic Parks. There are more dinosaurs and they all look great. The film contains more action than the first and its all exciting. One scene that stands out is the scene with the Raptors in the fields. I love the way Spielberg shot it.\n\n This is not a big acting movie, but its not that bad. Jeff Goldblum is good as Ian Malcolm, but had a little more energy in the first one. Julianne Moore is adequate but looks a bit uncomfortable at times. Vanessa Lee Chester is better than the other kids in the last film. The rest of the acting is adequate. \n\nMany people thought this film was redundant of the first. I wouldnt call it redundant but it is a little bit too familiar in areas.  The Lost World takes place in a different area but it is not much different from the first one. However, it is an entertaining movie. The action overshadows the story.\n\n The big problem I have with The Lost World is the ending. It doesnt make sense how The T-Rex got loose. Its also a King Kong Rip-Off. Its visually stunning looking, the TREX doesnt look out of place at all. But it was showing CGI instead of doing something with the story. Nevertheless, even with its flaws The Lost World is entertaining and not worthy of its horrible reviews.",

      "name": "A quality change of fate for Pixar",
      "reviewBody": "Everything about Brave is different from the Pixar norm, save the unequaled attention to detail and quality.\n\nThe Disney-Pixar animated feature focuses on Princess Merida as she searches for a way to change her fate. In a journey of magic, adventure and family, the fiery Scot is launched into the ranks of the elite Disney princesses. \n\nAs odd and understandably foreign as the accents felt watching the early previews for the movie, the voice acting was executed following, creating very real characters that fit their animated molds perfectly. By the end of the movie, what once sounded foreign blended into the scenery and visuals to create a completely immersing environment.\n\nIn fact, amid the magic spells and tall tales of times gone by, it&apos;s the historical, Scottish feeling that made Marida&apos;s journey and transformation (and that of her mother) that much more tangible and familiar.\n\nUnderneath the folk-tale storyline lies the same life lessons that ring true for young and old. Though the movie heavily focuses on a mother- daughter relationship, it&apos;s not just for girls anymore than Mulan was. Merida is a true Disney princess, with gumption, heart and an uncanny connection with nature, but the story could have been told from a male perspective and rung just as true, making it easy to empathize with Pixar&apos;s first female lead.\n\nAs has been the case with almost every other one of their movies, the company has reinvented the standard for animated visuals. The environments are based on real Scottish landmarks, adding real depth to the story, and the colors are as bright as they are grounded, creating a wonderfully real world. Such visuals lend credence to the upcoming 3D re-release of Finding Nemo, though not much, but also show just how far the studio has come. \n\nAll of the elements put together, Brave is a different sort of movie than many were expecting. More focused on a single pair and their quest together, not to mention darker by far, the story of Merida was a leap of faith for the once small studio. \n\nMany will have their doubts, left wanting another heart wrenching love story from Up or creative take on a beat to death genre like The Incredibles. That was never the purpose. Just as with every one of their award-winning films (Cars 2 notwithstanding), a new movie means a new chapter, new story and new style of film.\n\nTaken for what it is, Brave is a remarkable step into a whole new style of movie, proving the creative teams at Pixar will continue to write their own fate.",

Lately, I&apos;ve actually been getting more into the computer animation flicks and wanted to see what Madagascar was all about. I don&apos;t get why there are a lot of users here on IMDb that absolutely hate this film or didn&apos;t really get into it, because I thought it was a very cute and enjoyable film for the kids and adults.\n\nMarty, Meldman, Alex, and Gloria are all zoo kept animals who are pampered all day and entertain humans on a constant schedule. Marty wants more though, he wonders where he comes from and what it would be like to be in the wild. Alex, the lion, is truly against this and will have no part of it, but tries to find Marty after he escapes. The rest of the gang follows, but they are caught by the animal catchers and are sent back, but accidentally fall of the boat shipping them home and they end up on an island called Madagascar. They are &quot;welcomed&quot;, if that&apos;s the right word, by other animals and must learn how to survive, but it&apos;s going to be hard when Alex is starving for meat! \n\nI loved the American Beauty and Chariot of Fire references, I thought they were just so funny! There are more than a few good laughs in this film and I felt like it was being unfairly rated here on IMDb, yes, it&apos;s not as great as The Incredables, but I really feel like anyone could love this film. I&apos;m actually going to be on my way to buy it, I loved it that much, so please give this movie a fair chance. Believe me, it&apos;s worth your time.\n\n8/10",

    "description": "John Wick is on the run after killing a member of the international assassins&apos; guild, and with a $14 million price tag on his head, he is the target of hit men and women everywhere.",
    "summary": "Reviewers say 'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' is lauded for its intense action, creative choreography, and Keanu Reeves' performance. The film's world-building and expanded assassin universe receive praise. However, criticisms include a lack of coherent plot, repetitive action, and underdeveloped supporting characters. Some feel the film overemphasizes action at the expense of story and character development. Despite these issues, many find the movie enjoyable for its spectacle and entertainment value.",

      "reviewBody": "It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (&quot;prepare for war&quot;) sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can&apos;t seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).\n\nThe simplicity of the first film is therefore gone, and the slick fun is hurt because it feels bloated in scale, and has to work to sell this unsellable world to the viewer. At its best though, the film doesn&apos;t concern itself with this and instead has nicely flowing sequences of well-choreographed violence that is well directed and performed. It is brutally violent but it is almost like a ballet to watch it. Having two cast members from The Raid films had the positive impact of having them, but there was a negative too because those films manage to deliver stakes and tension in the violence - something John Wick just doesn&apos;t manage to ever do. I enjoyed the flow and pace, but never got caught up in a fight in a way where it had me on the edge of the seat; contrast the fight with Yayan Ruhian and Cecep Arif Rahman, and the fights that the two are involved with in The Raid 1 and 2 respectively - their John Wick fight is enjoyable but their fights in The Raid movies had weight, danger, and risk.\n\nThe endless lack of consequence does make it hard to stay engaged with, and it needs it to be cool and slick so that we never connect it to the real world - but seeing people stabbed in a busy train station with people just walking by without reaction does make that hard, for example. It is still slick, quite enjoyable tosh, and very well put together in terms of fight sequences, but it does feel bloated and overlong, and could have done with a tighter world - although I guess they cannot put that back in the box after the second movie took it out. Enjoyable for what it is, but it has a lot of weaknesses that detract while watching."

I was completely caught by surprise at the romantic, clever, intriguing, funny, interesting and thoroughly well written script. I had no idea about the plot and was happily led by Wilson&apos;s character into the depths of Paris&apos; magical midnight strike. Other actor&apos;s involved did a great job too. I was particularly impressed with McAdams as it just adds to her ability to play any role. I think overall I&apos;m simply in awe at the film. It&apos;s a classic. A really refreshing idea, gently portrayed in an almost realistic way, like this French magic really does exist. The music and scenery adds to the charm of the film and the subtle humour is a nice touch too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and will watch this over and over again for years to come.

Although it almost seems like cheating because Snyder got four hours to tell this superhero story, where the 2017 movie only had two. Still, this gives more room for character development, the storyline makes more sense, and there are some really cool moments. It didn&apos;t feel too long to me, actually, but I hope this doesn&apos;t usher in the era of 4+ hour films.",

      "reviewBody": "John Hughes was truly a magnificent writer for teenagers of the 80&apos;s. Even though a lot of people hated his previous works, it doesn&apos;t matter since many people have flaws in their career once in a while. Well, this is one of John Hughes&apos;s well-written classics: The Breakfast Club. It follows a group of teenage kids who have done something to get them to have detention on Saturday!(Bummer having to stay in that school on a weekend!) Sounds pretty simple huh? Well, later on the characters get to know each other thanks to the brilliant writing from John Hughes! Judd Nelson plays Bender who in the movie is called &quot;the Criminal&quot; and is a straight up asshole but in a cool way. The lovely Molly Ringwald plays Claire who attempts to hide things from people kinda like bottling her emotions. Plus there are other characters I wont get into. My favorite character is obviously Bender since he throws out the jokes which makes this movie funny. Now, be warned! You may start tearing up because there are a lot of issues covered in this movie that relates to real life. The stories the characters tell are very poignant and moving and riveting. So don&apos;t be surprised if you start crying during the movie. This is a brilliant John Hughes movie that launched his career next to Sixteen Candles(which is another good Hughes film). What makes this movie so great you say? The way the characters develop is genius thanks to the magnificent directing! The jokes are CLEVER unlike so many other comedies *cough Meet the Spartans*. However, while this movie is great it does have some flaws. One is its a little too long for my taste and its tone is a little mixed up at times. Like is this supposed to be a comedy or a drama? But thats a minor thing for me since I can relate to this movie as a teenager next to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Plus, there are so many memorable quotes in this movie! Go see John Hughes&apos;s finest written film! Sincerely Yours, The Breakfast Club",

Peter Jackson&apos;s KING KONG is the experience for which movies were invented. The CGI was incredible, the casting appropriate (this wasn&apos;t supposed to be an actor-driven, big-star film, after all), and the flow was satisfying. Even the somewhat slow build-up had a huge payoff once you see Kong running through the jungle with Ann in his giant hand. Is it a flawless movie? Probably not. But it Is a perfect example of why we go to movies in the first place-- to see things that we will never see in our real lives. When I walked out of the theater and was making my way through the deserted lobby, I had an odd feeling. Every poster I saw for an upcoming film kind of made me feel like all those movies were probably just going to be a waste of film next to KING KONG."

      "name": "Platoon focuses on the moral decay of the soldiers in the most unpopular war in modern American history",
      "reviewBody": "Many great war films of the Vietnam conflict are centered around these themes of blurred morality and the uselessness of war, and Oliver Stone&apos;s Platoon is among the most well known. Stone, who wrote and directed the film and also served as an infantryman in Vietnam, first rose to fame for his war films that dramatized the infamous Cold War conflict. The main premise of his magnum opus are the inner conflicts within US forces deployed to southeast Asia, rather than the actual physical conflicts between them and the Communist-allied Vietnamese forces. More broadly, Platoon analyzes the &quot;duality of man&quot; concept that has been studied in numerous other works, from fellow Vietnam War films like Full Metal Jacket (1987) and Apocalypse Now (1979), all the way back to the latter&apos;s source material and inspiration in Joseph Conrad&apos;s Heart of Darkness. \n\nPlatoon focuses on the moral decay of soldiers in American units, and how this contributes to their inability to fight their Vietnamese enemies. Charlie Sheen sums up this theme with his on-the-nose voiceover, &quot;We did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves... and the enemy was in us.&quot;\n\nVietnam War-movies tend to be even harder to watch than most war flicks, as the lines between the &quot;heroes&quot; and &quot;villains&quot; are blurred more than in any other dramatized period of warfare in recent human history. In wars like World War II, which are widely known for being as black and white as military conflicts have become, the contrasting features between the heroic forces we are meant to root for and their opposing enemy platoons are well defined. That is almost never the case with the United States-North Vietnamese/Vietcong conflict in Vietnam during the overarching Cold War.\n\nThat is not to say that most wars throughout human history have not been many shades of grey, with the winners and losers not always corresponding with the righteous and evil. But because of the guerrilla nature and infamous legacy of the Vietnam War itself - namely, the immense public protest against American involvement - the Vietnam War remains by far the most unpopular war in modern American history. With that said, most of the film is fantastic, from the aforementioned narrative to the grim lightning of the southeast Asian jungles that emphasize the film&apos;s tone, to the poignant, melancholic score.",

      "reviewBody": "Whilst visiting Earth an Alien is accidentally left behind and strikes up a friendship with a young boy.\n\nThe story centres around E.T. and his relationship with three children in a family where the parents are divorced and the father is not around. Much has been written about how autobiographical the movie is about Spielberg&apos;s own childhood and lots of unique little moments along these lines are captured in the most cinematic way possible. In fact some of the strongest scenes involve simple interaction between the family and their friends. These are not idealised Hollywood versions of families, but natural slices of suburban life that always feel real.\n\nE.T.&apos;s arrival and the events that follow help to fill the emptiness in the heart of the youngest son Elliott and they soon form a psychic bond together. Peace, tolerance and communication are explored constantly as we see visuals and hear dialogue connected to these themes throughout the movie.\n\nWe see everything from E.T.&apos;s perspective and share his experience as an alien visitor in a strange world. Nothing is explained, because what we see with our own eyes tells us everything we need to know. In fact the visuals are so powerful there was very little I had to explain to my three year old companion as she watched it with me.\n\nEverything builds towards a spectacular climax, which is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Again very little is said as this wonderfully emotional sequence very efficiently breaks our hearts.\n\nI didn&apos;t care much for E.T. during the 80s. I think it&apos;s because I was conditioned from a very young age by more violent and action orientated movies. Also, my mother was quite enthusiastic about it which back then could scrape the cool off most things. It was not until I was pushing forty with a three year old daughter that my perspective changed forever.\n\nWell done Mr Spielberg, probably your finest moment.",

Make us start to believe we know what will happen next, make us love the characters, then make us *want* things to happen next. Yes, tonight when seeing &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, all that happens, again. And then, exactly like in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, he pulls the carpet right from under us, in the final seconds of the movie takes away everything, every expectation, he first gave us. Many people will be so disappointed by this that they will end up hating the movie. So did I, for about five minutes. Now I know the movie will make me think, literally move my thoughts, for a long time after tonight. I want to see it again, right now. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Hollywood has a new master storyteller. His name is Manoj Night Shyamalan.",

Only Walken and Woods are missing.\n\nMaking de niro young kind of works and isn&apos;t as distracting as I thought and Pacino is fantastic. If you expect Pesci to be the nutjob he was in the other Scorsese movies then think again and this is no bad thing. Pesci is one of the best actors alive with a fantastic range and this movie proves it.\n\nThe Irishman is lovely to look at but for god sakes take a leak before you go or wait for its Netflix debut where you can watch it with whiskey and pause it for comfort breaks.",

      "reviewBody": "I can usually find something to engage with and love in any film. It is a sort of challenge and promise to myself to do so -- as a choice in building a life. But this movie was a nadir in my adventure.\n\nThe Alice stories are special, special absolutely and special to me.\n\nFor many people, the stories are simply amusing nonsense for children, something to be fuzzily remembered in the same way as, say, Peter Pan or a Grimm&apos;s tale. But it is anything but. Carroll advanced our ability to speak to ourselves when he polished the story and sent it to us. \n\nOne can hardly expect someone like Burton, or anyone making a big budget Disney- distributed project to understand the material. But if you cannot understand the soul of what you are working with, you cannot leverage or extend it. You will need to count on your own talents instead. But Burton&apos;s strength is simple: the imposition of disordered fantasy on relatively ordered reality. He has exhausted this and was finished as an artist long ago.\n\nBy any measure other than color intensity, this is a failure as a movie. When Depp isn&apos;t given a complex structure to support, he can at least be amusing. Here, we have not even that.\n\nWhat is normally considered nonsense sequences in the books are anything but. Dodgson was the foremost theory of logic in Europe at the time. Based in Oxford, he created the story for the child of the Dean, the creator of the then great Greek lexicon. Dodgson/Carroll was a master of the inadequacies of logic within the medium of everyday language. \n\nAll the &quot;nonsense&quot; sections are really a catalog of all the strange ways in which logic breaks when it encounters the way we linguistically form thoughts. Many of these parody assumptions Dean Liddell made in his understanding of Greek, mistakes that have saddled us with flawed scholarship on Aristotle and his logic. They are great, great fun: puzzles that even a 6 year old can laugh about.\n\nThis is where playful narrative originates. Only Shakespeare, Joyce and Lennon-NcCartney have had similar influence on our everyday thought. Karl Rove, for example, stands on the shoulders of Charles Dodgson&apos;s trickery.\n\nNone of this is conveyed. None, even though the Marx brothers made this safe territory for film humor.\n\nEven the overall structure of the Alice stories is cool. Dodgson was not a pedophile, nor a drug addict, but he was something more dangerous to his soul. He was a charter member of Oxford&apos;s Psychical Society and a student of the inventor of mystical tarot, the self-named Court de Gebelin. The structure of the Alice stories, based on this, is our first structurally folded literature.\n\nHis ordination ruined by his guilt about this, he spent the remainder of his life writing a C S Lewis-like Christian allegory, Sylvie and Bruno to make amends. It was every bit as tepid and worthless as this. Every bit as wrong, as offensive to reality.\n\nThe movie also mixes in Jabberwocky. That was a poem written years earlier as a teen, to amuse his crotchety parson father, someone obsessed with the perversion of noble Saxon words by effete French. The poem is about the battle between true (Saxon) language and logical language.\n\n(This comment is on the two-dimensional exhibition. I decided that the effects would be beowulf-like and cheaply distracting. I think I was right.)\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

      "reviewBody": "The director and the writer, Paul Weitz and Adam Herz respectively, will do anything for a laugh -- that&apos;s good, as it turns out, because this movie has a great many laughs in it.  There&apos;s not much of that restricting, suffocating &quot;logic&quot; stuff around, but &quot;American Pie&quot; is immensely enjoyable. I mean, almost none of the things that happen in this film would ever, ever come to pass in real life, but it doesn&apos;t matter.\n\nFor starters, the characters aren&apos;t all one-dimensional.  Thankfully, they&apos;re two-dimensional, so right away it has an edge on 60-70% of all the movies ever made.\n\nMoreover, it&apos;s heart is in the right place.  Most high school movies these days are all about cruelty and malice, especially towards (and among) the women.  Not the case here.  This is the first conventional high school movie I&apos;ve ever seen that made me smile so much (I say conventional because &quot;Rushmore&quot; still trumps every one of them).\n\nFurthermore, it&apos;s very funny.  I wouldn&apos;t dare give away any of the really great gags (we&apos;ve all seen the trailer -- that&apos;s not the one I mean), but I&apos;ll say this:  Weitz and Herz are extraordinarily skilled in audience manipulation, which is to say that they know how and when to spring unexpected surprises upon us.  They also know how to use foul language for punch, rather than punctuation.\n\nThe soundtrack is another positive.  It&apos;s all about joy and high energy -- even music from Third Eye Blind and Barenaked Ladies that suffers from radio overplay fits the mood appropriately.",

I had hope, and, for the most part, my only criterion was that it be better than Pacific Rim, Hollywood&apos;s attempt at the kaiju genre last year. I liked that one, but was disappointed (with Guillermo del Toro, I expected something with a little more meat). Godzilla does not clear that hurdle. It has the same major problem that all these kinds of films do: the human element is lacking. Severely here. And what a fantastic cast to waste! Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe! Every single one of them utterly wasted. Hopefully they all got a big check. We have all these people, but instead we&apos;re saddled with charisma black hole Aaron Taylor-Johnson (of Kick-Ass fame), who isn&apos;t even adequate. Thankfully, the big monster fights deliver, for the most part. There could maybe be more monster action, but when it&apos;s there, it&apos;s a lot of fun. I also thank the filmmakers for restraining themselves and keeping the film at only two hours (it runs a tad over that if you stay through the credits).",

      "reviewBody": "I do not want to do an in-depth analysis of this film. Rather, I&apos;ll point out what I consider makes it a very poor effort: the script. The same guy who did the script for CRASH also did the script for MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Both won the Oscar for best picture. I must be pretty out of touch to criticize this guy, but here goes. The main problem is that every character is &quot;invented&quot;. That is, each character is so obviously the product of a fertile (and I am using that word kindly) imagination. In CRASH the politician and his wife are absolute stereotypes. They speak the most inane lines, like from a comic book or low-grade soap opera. The two cops are similarly contrived. One is a good guy and one is a bad guy. One is an idealist. One is a cynical veteran. I imagine such categories of cops do exist, but to give them life it takes someone who knows the genres, like Joseph Wambaugh. (In fact, to see how really bad CRASH is, just compare it to THE ONION FIELD). We also have the two foul-mouthed gang-banging black youth, hell bent on insanity. Big deal. Anyone can produce such characters. There is the misunderstood, good-guy Mexican plumber, who just happens to love his young daughter oh so much. Etc. Etc. Each character has the depth of a comic-book creation. They all speak in litanies of clichés. The plot too is just a clever manage of intersections. It is so obviously the product of the next cup of coffee or cigarette. It is cleverness without depth or substance. Christ, that this film won best picture just begs belief.\n\nWhile I am getting in my two cents here, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is the same cliché-riddled mess. It is obvious that the guy who wrote knew nothing about boxing. The characters are pathetic, lifeless creations.\n\nWhat has Hollywood come to that such movies walk away with top prize?"

No offense to him, but I found Cruise better. He was just outstanding in here as the immoral hit-man. Foxx was entertaining, too, as the nerd-ish cab driver who is pulled into Cruise&apos;s murdering adventures. \n\nYou&apos;ll appreciate both of these guys, and the great visuals, more on the second viewing after you are familiar with the story. The intense film is definitely worth more than one look. Check out the behind-the-scenes documentary, too. You&apos;ll be glad you are not an actor in one of Mann&apos;s films.",

      "reviewBody": "When the two worlds of Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart collide in Milos Forman&apos;s Amadeus, it is anything but a symphony. As the court composer of the Emperor of Austria, all Salieri desires are fame and recognition as a composer; it is all he had wanted his whole life. When he learns that Mozart, whose name he had known as long as he can remember, is going to come to the court to play, Salieri cannot wait to meet the outstanding and righteous man that he knows he must be. However, when Salieri learns that Mozart is a young, crude, and unrefined young man, endowed with all the talent and ability that he ever wanted and strived for, it plants a seed of jealousy that soon grows into bitter resentment and hatred, not only for Mozart, but also towards God. Salieri&apos;s desire to get rid of him is seemingly boundless as he plots and schemes for Mozart&apos;s demise. It is no wonder why Amadeus won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, with 5-Star performances by F. Murry Abraham as Antonio Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart. Amadeus is an emotionally charged and tragic piece, a story of the life of one of the world&apos;s most famous composers, as seen through the eyes of his worst enemy."

If you are reading this now and haven&apos;t yet seen the trailer, I would recommend you don&apos;t watch the trailer and just go straight to the film, Some of the best parts are shown in the trailer. To watch this film you don&apos;t really need to have seen the first however I would recommend you do as at points the film refers to Despicable Me (1).\n\nI&apos;m going to keep this review short and simply say, I gave this film a 9* rating as I found it strongly entertaining, not as funny as I thought but still a great film! The story line was also very easy to follow and keeps you engaged throughout.\n\nWould recommend this film to anyone! I would say most people will enjoy this film, find it entertaining and recommend it to there friends! \n\nThis film is perfect for any family to view!",

      "reviewBody": "Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It&apos;s less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.\n\nAt its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today&apos;s zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie&apos;s backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.\n\nThe universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That&apos;s mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",

      "reviewBody": "The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe should go down in the history books right up there with the likes of Lord of the Rings. I went to see it expecting a very good movie. I came out stunned by the magnitude of the picture. Everything about it is so well done, the casting, the scenery, the score. Lord of the Rings is the only thing I can think of to compare it to. I experienced the same overwhelming sense of awe watching both of these phenomenal pictures. The CG images are very good, though not quite as startlingly realistic as those in LOTR. I cannot find fault with the casting in any way.\n\nThough the voice of Liam Neeson is not as I would have imagined a lion&apos;s at first, it is smooth, confident, and effective. Aslan is given the presence so essential to the heart of the story. I must comment on the performance of James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, which I believe was the best in the film. Lucy was adorable, and surprisingly convincing, and Peter was given a very firm performance. I was a little nervous about how Edmund would turn out, but I needn&apos;t have worried; those large, startlingly dark eyes are perfect for the change from traitor to hero. \n\nI commend the directors of the movie on their strict adherence to the book. Narnia isn&apos;t just &quot;based&quot; on the book. It IS the book. The scope, depth, and wonder of Lewis&apos;s world have been captured in a timeless manner that should be cherished for all ages. This is a movie for everyone, at a level for children to understand, yet with a fast plot and exciting battle sequences that will keep anyone interested. The last battle scene especially is as touching as any I have ever seen, including those in LOTR, putting tears in my eyes even while my heart soared. Go see Narnia for an exciting, well-done film, and a timeless message that our world so desperately needs.\n\nTen stars!!",

      "reviewBody": "Well I knew I would have to review this movie sooner or later being this was the only film I saw in theaters in 2011 which I wish now I saw more but it is what it is.\n\nI love Transformers and as you know from my reviews of Transformers Movies, Video Games and TV Shows I am a huge fan of the Transformers however I know not all Transformers can be perfect and this movie prove to be that.\n\nTransformers: Dark Of The Moon prove what happens when you&apos;re not paying attention to anything. Everything about this film just feels disappointing.\n\nThe Autobots: Optimus Prime (Voiced by Peter Cullen), Sentinel Prime (Voiced by Leonard Nimoy), Ironhide (Jess Harnell), Ratchet (Voiced by Robert Foxworth), Sideswipe (Voiced by James Remar), Mirage &quot;Dino&quot; (Franceso Quinn),Bumblebee, Wheeljack &quot;Que&quot; (Voiced by George Coe), Wheelie (Voiced by Tom Kenny) Brains (Voiced by Reno Wilson) The Wreckers Roadbuster (Voiced by Ron Bottitta) and Leadfoot (Voiced by John Dimaggio)\n\nThe Decepticons: Megatron (Voiced by Hugo Weaving), Starscream (Voiced by Charlie Adler), Soundwave,Barricade, Shockwave (Voiced by Frank Welker), Laserbeak (Voiced by Keith Szarabajka) and Greg Berg voices Igor.\n\nThe voice talent and their performances are what I like best about this movie and it was awesome to have Mr.Nimoy return to Transformers because anything he touches turns to gold. As I set in the theater listening to his voice work I can&apos;t help but think of Galvatron the role he first performance in Transformers. It&apos;s good to have Peter Cullen and Frank Welker in the film together since they are part of the Transformers for so long and you can&apos;t have one without the other.\n\nThe plot of the movie was good enough as it did have a tense story line Action scenes in the film are the rewarding part as you are given tense and extreme battles. The music is also very well done Also the Special effects are just awesome that is enough to make you go wow\n\nThe disappointment I have with this film is that the comedy was really Bad comedy they try to push the comedy and I swear it just so bad that I wanted to cry. The human characters the new ones are pretty much awful and just really insulted my intelligence it just made you wish they added more transformers instead of more stupid human characters who are not even worth the screen time\n\nThis in my opinion is the weakest of the films yes I know &quot;Revenge Of The Fallen&quot; got a bad rap but this one deserves it more because it is like a wreck on a wreck while it does have some things to make it watchable.\n\nWhat I like the best of the film is The voice performances of the cast, the music and the action scenes that are just what you hope for in Transformers. What I hated the most is the human cast who are just pretty much the worse punch line in the history of punch lines\n\nBut the plot, the action scenes and the voice performances are the redeeming features of this movie\n\nI give Transformers: Dark Of The Moon an 7 out of 10",

      "reviewBody": "The smartest move DC ever made was to quit concerning themselves with cinematic world building and focus on making (mostly) standalone films that were simply entertaining...and didn&apos;t require a master&apos;s degree in Snydernomics to appreciate.\n\nTheir second smartest move was nabbing James Gunn for The Suicide Squad, and not just because the first film was terrible. Material like this needs Gunn&apos;s flair for irreverence, clever dialogue and, most importantly, instilling characters with engaging personalities. He may not have created Suicide Squad, but this adaptation has his stamp all over it.\n\nAnd for the first time since his directorial debut, Slither, Gunn is unbound by the restrictions of a PG-13 rating, something else the material really needed. Hence, the film is vivid, violent and vulgar, yet at the same time, seldom feels pandering or gratuitous. Punctuated by gobs of gags and hilarious dialogue, the movie earns its dismemberments and f-bombs along the way. In fact, the whole thing plays very much like Guardians of the Galaxy without a filter.\n\nAnd like Guardians, it&apos;s ultimately the characters that matter. Ironically, the one we&apos;re most familiar with - Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) - is the least interesting, perhaps because she&apos;s already been established with two previous films and there isn&apos;t much more Gunn could do with her. But everyone else is wonderfully realized and played perfectly by the ensemble cast. As Bloodsport, the de-facto leader of this new team, Idris Elba strikes the right balance of stoicism and uncertainty, while John Cena (as Peacemaker) once-again demonstrates he&apos;s more adept at comedy than pure action. Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmaichian) and Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) are also fun, each with amusing backstories. But King Shark steals every scene he&apos;s in, a perpetually hungry manfish who manages to be both monstrous and endearing (and a role Sylvester Stallone was born to play).\n\nWith the exception of Task Force X director Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), the antagonists are perfunctory. Their plan, however, is gloriously insane; the dictator of Corto Maltese plans to wipe out America using a 30-year-old experiment gone wrong: Starro, a giant extraterrestrial starfish that spawns face-hugging offspring to re-animate &amp; control the dead. This leads to a final act that&apos;s as hilarious as it is grotesque, aided by amusing visual effects.\n\nUnlike the first film - which was mostly just bells &amp; whistles - The Suicide Squad is the complete package, delivering an abundance of action, humor, violence and well-realized characters. James Gunn&apos;s playful approach is just what was needed, making it the best - and maybe the smartest - DC film since Christopher Nolan hung up his spurs.",

But going undercover is never easy, especially with such affable miscreants.\n\nThe basic premise is really nothing special. But then again, it doesn&apos;t need to be. The point of this movie is in its style. It has fast cars, lots of racing, lots of hot, greased-up babes, muscle-heavy men (and cars) and a killer soundtrack. You don&apos;t watch it to be intrigued by carefully orchestrated plot points or tragic backstories or the heaviness of its pathos. No, you watch it to kick back, relax and have a good time.\n\nAnd in delivering that, the movie more than delivers. But if it was just that, I&apos;d probably rate the film a bit lower. What actually elevates this film above its immediate peers and helped launch a huge franchise, is the fact that this film is punching above its weight class and succeeding. And it does that by having some real good actors playing roles they were born to play. Walker is one of them, but I also have to mention Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez.\n\nThe dialogue is also surprisingly snappy and memorable. The plot, while basic, succeeds in making you care for these characters, and it also manages to make itself feel novel, despite arguably being at least a little clichéd. Once again, the fact that you care for these characters matters a lot.\n\nNot a groundbreaking movie by any means, but it has surprising quality underneath all the testosterone being forcibly pumped into your veins.",

      "reviewBody": "Michael Corleone has sold his illegal business in an attempt to win back his family.  However he must still contend with up and coming mobsters such as Vincent, who wants to work for him and Joey Zasa, who wants to fully take over the Corleone family&apos;s territory.  When the Corleone family begin to deal with the Vatican and plan to buy out their share of an multinational corporation he finds that the Vatican is just as corrupt as his illegal operations were.  Despite his best efforts he finds himself sucked back into the world he has tried to leave behind.\n\nEasily one of the most hated films ever made  or at least you&apos;d think it was by the critical mauling it got for a raft of reasons.  However watching it now it isn&apos;t that bad and really it only suffers from comparison with the two films before it.  But lets be fair, Coppola has made 3 or 4 of the best films ever made  did we really expect another one from him?\n\nThe film has a reasonable plot and brings the trilogy to a logical end.  The plot however does have it&apos;s weaknesses  for example it starts well with Michael&apos;s attempt to `get out&apos; being hampered by other families on their way up.  But when it starts to get involved with money laundering through the Vatican and the corruption therein, it starts to lose it&apos;s way and it&apos;s focus on Michael.\n\nThe main weakness comes in the characters.  Would Michael really go straight just to get his family back  and how come he managed to do it so easily up till the time of the film?  Worse still is Connie who seems to have become some sort of Mafia widow when that was not part of her character in the previous films  would she really have got that twisted or influential? Little problems like these just bugged me and they also fed into the performances.\n\nFor such a great cast the acting was very average.  Pacino is good but I sensed he didn&apos;t see Michael turning out this way and he didn&apos;t convince occasionally.  Keaton has little to do and again I felt that her approach to Michael was too forgiving, although maybe I&apos;m not allowing for time.  As I Siad before Shire was doing some sort of `Bride of Frankenstein&apos; act as Connie and I didn&apos;t buy it for a moment.  Garcia was OK and faces like Wallach, Hamilton and the like helped.  The two worst performances were sadly two of the main ones.  First Joe Mantegna..now it wasn&apos;t that it was bad  it was more that I&apos;ve seen him do so much better.  Here all I could think of when I watched him was how his character and his acting was very like his Simpsons&apos; character of ` Fat Tony&apos;.  Bare in mind Fat Tony is meant to be a spoof of the Mafioso characters and you&apos;ll see why I didn&apos;t like it.\n\nThe worse performance was Sofia Coppola.  Now she was vilified at the time for her role  a bit unfairly and cruelly but she was still bad.  She has this strange scowl on her face for most of the film and she acts like a spoil little girl.  She also has no realism in her voice and speaks in the same constant tone  that Vincent would fall for her was just a leap of faith too far to accept.  The cast does have others who are unused or underused  Fonda being the best example.  Why did she bother with that role!?\n\nOverall, this is miles behind the other two Godfathers and it has plenty of weaknesses.  However at it&apos;s heart it&apos;s a good try as the concluding part and the story is watchable.  It&apos;s not bad, it just is average and it feels like the director and large sections of the cast felt they just had to turn up to make a third classic film."

      "reviewBody": "Aside from a few very marketable films like &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; and &quot;Aladdin&quot;, Guy Ritchie is a writer/director who makes incredibly violent films. That is, incredibly violent films which are also brilliantly constructed and near perfect. While I rarely ever watch violent films, I eagerly look for his next dark British crime film, after seeing his &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; and &quot;Snatch&quot;....and so it&apos;s not surprising I&apos;d see &quot;The Gentlemen&quot;. And, like these other films, it&apos;s near perfect...and a film you ought to see if you have the stomach for this sort of story.\n\nSo this leads me to a huge warning. This is NOT a family-friendly film nor one you want to show your mother or Father Jenkins if he stops by for a visit. There&apos;s ample cursing, loads of violence, vomit galore, and the story is about bad people...very bad people.\n\nThe story is complicated...and goes together like a finely crafted puzzle. It concerns a marijuana czar in Britain, Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) and his desire to sell out and retire to a life of ease and sophistication. However, after making an offer to a rival drug kingpin, suddenly everything goes haywire....folks start dying, farms growing the stuff are hit and an all-out war seems inevitable. There&apos;s WAY more to the story than this...but since it&apos;s so complex, it&apos;s best you just see it to appreciate it.\n\nThe bottom line is that Guy Ritchie can write and direct amazing films...and this one is truly amazing and entertaining. Apart from his misguided vanity project, &quot;Swept Away&quot;, his output has been impressive and I cannot stress enough what a quality product this film is. My only MINOR quibble is what about the Russian mobster.....what happens with him? This isn&apos;t really dealt with in the film and seems a bit like a dangling plot point.",

      "name": "Christopher McQuarrie makes this the best entry in the series yet!",
      "reviewBody": "Having seen the previous four &apos;Mission Impossible&apos; films, I have to admit that none of them impressed me to the degree that I had hoped. I guess my expectations for action thrillers centering on secret agents were set too high because I saw the &apos;Bourne&apos; trilogy and Daniel Craig&apos;s James Bond films first. The first three &apos;MI&apos; films all seemed a little too slow, cheesy or convoluted on my first viewing. The fourth one was pretty good, even if the story does feel a little forgettable\n\nSo, where does that bring me for the fifth entry of the franchise? My expectations were set at average around this time, despite all the good word-of-mouth I&apos;ve been hearing. However, it wouldn&apos;t have mattered if my expectations were set around the same level for the latest &apos;Bourne&apos; or James Bond film (very high) – &apos;MI:5&apos; blew everything I&apos;d expected from it and then some! \n\nWhere to begin? The film possible contains the biggest, and possibly best, story out if all the other installments. It is fascinatingly complex and dynamic – moving from country to country, dealing with characters who have questionable allegiances – all on top of Ethan Hunt trying to outrun the CIA while trying to get to the bottom of what the Syndicate really wants. It may seem like a lot, but the script is really well structured and paced. Even though the film does take a few liberties with how some of its characters will ultimately act in the end, the plot isn&apos;t nearly as predictable as one would make it out to be. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie also manages to squeeze in some surprisingly silly moments at the most random of moments.\n\nThe action scenes in this film are also some of the best in this franchise. Soon after showing Ethan Hunt take off on the side of an airbus, the film kicks it into overdrive and delivers an adrenaline rush packed with REALLY well done car chases, okay hand-to-hand combat scenes (they&apos;re kind of choppy), and ONE very suspenseful, pulse-pounding scene involving multiple snipers. McQuarrie&apos;s direction over the editing of these sequences is incredibly nuanced – so much so that I found myself repeatedly leaning over the edge of my seat with excitement.\n\nPeople who weren&apos;t fans of the cheese factor (forced romances, convenient gadgets, and the overuse of face masks) of the previous films would be glad to know that it&apos;s been done away with in this film. And for people fearing that this is a film that takes itself too seriously, let me be one of the first to say: it doesn&apos;t. One may draw parallels between the events that have happened in this film to some of the recent events in our world, but I see it as a clever way for the franchise to keep up with our times.\n\n&apos;Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation&apos; is without a doubt one of the most exciting films I&apos;ve had the pleasure of experiencing this year. It completely took me by surprise with how well-done it was, and should just about take anyone else to the same conclusion.",

Lauded for its tension, cinematography, and Toni Collette's performance, it offers psychological depth and blurs reality with the supernatural. Yet, some criticize its slow pace and ambiguous ending. Its atmospheric approach, eschewing jump scares, is both a strength and a divisive element. Ultimately, 'Hereditary' is a bold, memorable horror film, though it may not resonate with all audiences.",

I&apos;ve always been a fan of fast witty dialogue and this movie definitely delivers! Virtually every character in the movie whether minor or major seems to have something funny to say, and while there wasn&apos;t a lot of ROFL moments, there were quite a few LOL&apos;s throughout the movie! To me, it&apos;s one of those movies perfect for a Friday night to unwind from work without having to use too many brain cells (but enough so that you don&apos;t walk out of there thinking you&apos;d wasted your time and intellect!) - it&apos;s one of those movies that i&apos;ll definitely be purchasing on DVD when it comes out!!",

      "reviewBody": "Too many sequels suffer from Deja Vu, and hardly any of those carbon copies improve upon the original. Home Alone 2 is a carbon copy, but it&apos;s also much better and more complex a movie than the first. In another mad rush to the airport the McCallisters make a point of remembering Kevin this time, but he gets lost in a crowd at the airport and follows a man who looks like his dad onto the wrong plane. Thirteen of the McCallisters are going to Miami for Xmas (do they never stay at home?) but Kevin is headed for the Big Apple, and he&apos;s going to have that once-in-a-lifetime vacation he&apos;s been wishing for.\n\nThere&apos;s much more for Kevin to see and do in New York. He scams his way into the Plaza hotel where a suspicious Concierge (Tim Curry) gives him mighty evil looks at every encounter. He goes to Duncan&apos;s Toy Chest, the biggest toy store in town and takes many scenic photographs. Though it is a little unnerving now seeing Kevin on the roof of the World Trade Centre.\n\nBut the Wet Bandits have escaped, and they have just arrived in New York with loftier ambitions and bigger heists to pull off. They even brush by Kevin a few times not knowing he&apos;s there. Typically though, once they get a hold of him the give away far too much info. Once Kevin escapes he takes matters into his own hands once more. His Aunt Georgette from the first movie is still in Paris so he uses her half-renovated home as a huge mousetrap for the bungling burglars.\n\nThe booby traps this time are much more painful and nasty, so it&apos;s all the more amusing for us. Who can possibly fail to laugh at Marv getting the shock of his life when he tries to turn on the taps? If the movie were to be released now I doubt if it would be let away with a PG rating. Still, it&apos;s nothing for any parents to worry about. Unless you fear your child is going to set your head on fire with a blowtorch.\n\nHome Alone 2 has a more satisfying climax than the first. The film doesn&apos;t simply end once Harry and Marv are back in the slammer as there is more plot to it than that. Brenda Fricker has a (rather questionable) role as &apos;The Pigeon Lady&apos; a woman who lives in Central Park and talks to no one-until Kevin reaches out. Plus Eddie Bracken shows up as Mr. Duncan and gives Kevin the best Christmas morning ever as a token of his appreciation.\n\nWith a bigger story (okay, some of it re-used) and more characters and a better playground for Kevin, Home Alone 2 manages to be a superior sequel. While not excessively so. There&apos;s loads of fun to be had in Kevin&apos;s antics, and Tim Curry is downright brilliant as the mischievous Concierge.\n\nIt&apos;s a great movie on it&apos;s own but sadly it will always be called a copycat. Watch it now from a fresh perspective and you might like it more.",

A horrible accident in the workplace causes him to fall further down the spiral. Is there a conspiracy against him or is he going insane? The lead character is played with discomforting perfection by a repulsively thin and unrecognizable Christian Bale. This is a very moody and atmospheric film that is reminiscent of Lynch (though, by the end, it is a much more spelled-out than Lynch would do for the viewer). Still, it is a very gripping and disturbing movie. &quot;The Machinist&quot; is one of the better horror films released this year. My Rating: 8.5/10",

    "summary": "Reviewers say 'The Lives of Others' is acclaimed for its intense depiction of life under Stasi surveillance in East Germany, highlighting themes of privacy and power abuse. Ulrich Mühe's performance as the conflicted officer is outstanding, and the film's pacing and tension are masterful. Critics value its deep exploration of humanity and ethics. However, some find it slow, with predictable twists, and critique its Hollywood-like approach. Despite this, it is widely seen as powerful and thought-provoking.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Who knows the secrets of the human heart?&quot; Col in The Crying Game \n\nWhenI saw 2006&apos;s Oscar winning Departed, I was satisfied it could be the best picture of the year; then I saw Pan&apos;s Labyrinth and thought it imaginatively superior; then I saw Lives of Others, the Oscar choice for best foreign film, and I knew it was the globe&apos;s best film of the year, no argument.\n\nLives of Others is what all movie making should strive to be: interesting characters, thrilling plot, superb acting, and thematic weight. It&apos;s set in East Berlin, 1984, five years before the Wall&apos;s fall and Gorbachev&apos;s &quot;glasnost&quot; and still felling the tremors of Nazism, in this case the Stasi, a government agency similar to the SS. Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muehe), a Stasi teacher and coldly efficient information gatherer, surreptitiously watches playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) to get compromising details that would damn Dreyman and open the romantic way for the culture minister, Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme). Oddly for an artist, Dreyman is loyal to socialism, so it is through Sieland that the information must come.\n\nThe dramatic hub of this absorbing intrigue is the growing affection Wiesler gains for the actress and coincidentally the underground freedom movement, mostly as it is represented by artists and their friends. While his efficiency is amply evident in his cool detachment, similar to that of Rafe Fiennes in Schindler&apos;s List and Serg Lopez in Pan&apos;s Labyrinth, his humanity seeps out at the edges as he becomes vicariously involved in the artists&apos; lives. First-time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck misses not a beat in slowly revealing the hearts of all his principals while he creates a plot remarkably interesting for a character-driven piece.\n\nFew films could mine the rich conflict between the totalitarian state and artists who yearn for freedom of expression, between the loyalties of friends and lovers and the crushing exigency of survival. Lives of Others shows how difficult it is to watch others&apos; lives unfold and not be drawn to their passion. It&apos;s rough out there: No other film of 2006 showed that cliché better. Here&apos;s looking at you, best film of the year."

      "reviewBody": "Well, this was unexpected! Going into this film I found myself with no hype at all. I expected a good, fun and cheesy movie time and I came out of the theater happy and surprised. While this isn&apos;t a masterpiece of filmmaking it does achieve what it sets out to do. To entertain you. And it does this quite good and sometimes it goes further than this by showing us some amazing set pieces and action sequences. For example one car, tank chase sequence! This is achieved by the gigantic production value of the film. You can literally smell the money that comes out of these guys. The whole movie you have this sense of scale, and I mean BIG scale! The amazing sound mixing and design including the music pumps you up and puts you in the mood! While the acting isn&apos;t Oscar worthy it is very fluid and it doesn&apos;t always feel forced. The chemistry between the cast is very solid and credible. Diesel and &quot;The Rock&quot; where pretty solid along with the secondary characters, and the villain was surprisingly tolerable. Another thing that solidifies the movie are the effects. These are outstanding along with the camera-work! The things that brought the movie down for me a little bit where some of the stunts, and weirdly some of these I found pretty amazing but although I understand this movie isn&apos;t supposed to be taken seriously there were some stunts that were just plain unbelievable, specially in the third act of the movie. And finally, the plot. While not groundbreaking it did have its interesting points but it doesn&apos;t drift away from the cheese factors. Overall I was quite surprised by what this movie did and how the director and producers exploited and used their huge production value. This is an example of a good quality action flick.",

      "reviewBody": "When hiring this movie was first suggested I turned up my nose at it. I thought, another teenagers flick where the hottest guy in school has to appreciate a lesser unpopular chick etc etc etc. Since seeing it it has enterred my all time favourites list. Any old somebody can take the formula of The Taming of the Shrue and put it into a school yard, and any old somebody can avoid cle she&apos;s in the finer details, coming up with decent alternatives is the hard part, whatever they did here works like clockwork. I would easily give it the best teen flick mantle.\n\nFirstly, the acting is perfect, the roles are not overly demanding but Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger play this to perfection. The supporting cast is great aswell, there is not a soul that doesn&apos;t contribute to the perfection of it all. Realism is neither what they were really going for nor what makes the movie. The language and vocabulary of these kids is phenominal, words like, Vapid, Pensive, Hanus, Tempestuous, Miscreants. There are lots of words like these throughout the movie. It is the thing that does the most to enable adult enjoyment.\n\nFor once they avoided the school bully theme, the bad guy in this is just a model who the chicks like and some of the guys hang with and alot of others just realise he is a fool. The recessive geek role is this time given alot more credibility, he is given the majority of the genuinely witty one liners and finds a soul mate for himself, instead of them just making it a joke that he stays a joke. There are a few parts you can really cheer in, you have to watch it to appreciate them. There is truly never a dull moment.\n\n The best quote of the whole movie would have to be &quot;it&apos;s just an excuse for all the nerds at our school to rub up against each other to distract themselves from the pathetic emptiness of thier meaningless consumer driven lives&quot; that pretty much sums up the purpose of teen parties these days. For once you actually identify with the &quot;bitch&quot; role in this, both she and the guy that is falsely pursuing her take a backward step, usually when it comes time for the leading man to apolagise for his deceit you really cant believe him after they have focused for so long on his efforts, this time for some reason you do, it fits straight into the story. There is another half to that situation here aswell but I wont disclose, it is probably the best bit of the movie.\n\nAnd the last major point is that this time the father character is a hell of alot stronger than before, if that had been weak so would the rest of the movie have been, but he is not. He has a reason for being there and you identify with him aswell. It is clear to see they were making the characters all strong in thier own right and stronger than the actual story.\n\nTo sum it all up the characters, story and acting are all perfect, adults can enjoy this one aswell, also because the main relationships are more stable and adult than the unpredictability of true teenage relationships, if they can be called such. So here is the count.\n\nProduction Values 2/2, Acting 2/2, Quality and Meaning 1.5/2, Screenplay 2/2, Originality 1/2\n\nAnyone can get something from this movie and most can get alot. This is a must. For the movie it is I would give it 10 but going by the main qualities listed above which all movies can be measured by it would get\n\n8.5/10"

It will be enough for me to mention that there had been no other movie where I&apos;d had to pause the play in mere awe at the magnificence of the storyline! At a point, It was as if I could see my jaw on the floor praising in thorough amusement the brilliance, relevance-to-our-daily-lives, deepness of message, sophistication, great portrayal, top-of-the-class creativity, marvelous acting/directing/screen writing all having come together in a movie, which called for a rating of 9 out of 10 and no less, certainly, undoubtedly.\n\nAl-Pacino&apos;s acting is to no surprise as brilliant as ever, exuding confidence, proficiency and clarity as always. Keanu Reaves leaves a great master-play in his work, meeting up to the acting skills required in displaying a character of wisdom, success, love and perhaps, of vanity. Charize Theron too puts up a play of passion in its right.\n\nBut what amused me more than all were the great and fantastic script-lines thrown around. All very meaningful and interesting indeed. The whole movie got me stunned and fixed at the edge of my desk seat, but the favorite part for me has to come at the end, where the theme of the movie comes to words and finds a chance as of clarifying itself in one the most brilliant ways I as one have ever seen possible! Recommended for everybody willing to enjoin on a meaningful story and a blend of excellent plays... surely a 9/10.",

The fights are absolutely amazing..But the character beats especially the last 10mins (Dom &amp; Letty and the goodbye on the beach)..Tej as (Ludacris) and Roman as (Tyrese Gibson) were amazing and they had their moments..Everyone did a wonderful job! the stories in this series might be questionable but the character work and the relationships.. NOTHING comes close to matching The Fast and Furious Family\n\nThe ending had the entire theater crying.. RIP Paul",

When this sequel was released, I was impressed with the number of stars and locations mostly in Europe, and certainly a huge budget. Unfortunately, this movie does not have the most relevant component: a decent screenplay. The beginning is confused and most of the situations and dialogs are not funny, being indeed ridiculous; when the execution of the heist is disclosed in the end, it is ludicrous; and the absurd plot itself is totally unbelievable and does not work. The direction is also very bad, with horrible and weird movements of camera. Steven Soderbergh began his career with exceptional works, but his last films are very deceptive (&quot;Full Frontal&quot;(2002); &quot;Solaris&quot;(2002)). My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Doze Homens e Outro Segredo&quot; (&quot;Twelve Men and Other Secret&quot;)",

The Terminatrix doesn&apos;t really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "name": "Clever, scary and funny - a must-see for horror fans",
      "reviewBody": "Making a brilliant, original horror film is pretty hard these days, since practically everything has already been told, and more than once. Using that premise, director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson came up with Scream, whose cleverness derives from the fact that it knows every single stereotype of the genre and satirizes them.\n\nTake the opening sequence, for example: a young girl (Drew Barrymore) is making popcorn and waiting for her boyfriend when she suddenly receives a phone call. Normally, this would be a huge clichè, only this time the killer decides to play a little game (horror film quiz, naturally) with his victim. In fact, the only reason why he kills her is that she gave the wrong answer to one of his questions (those who haven&apos;t seen Friday 13th might want to skip that bit, as it spoils said movie&apos;s ending). That scene is both very scary (the murder is quite graphic and disturbing) and at the same time funny (it tests the characters&apos;, and the audience&apos;s, knowledge of the horror genre), and the rest of the film continues in the same vein: after the first killing, the masked psychopath starts disposing of other teenagers in the town of Woodsboro using the same technique. One of the targets is Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), whose mother was raped and killed the year before. This implies the killer might be the same, but who could it be? Sidney&apos;s distant father? Her mother&apos;s lover (Liev Schreiber)? Or some random guy, with no motive at all?\n\nFortunately, it is not the last category: this murderer has a motive and a plausible identity as well. But it isn&apos;t the payoff that makes Scream interesting; it&apos;s how Craven and Williamson get to it, by outlining the genre&apos;s conventions (some of which were actually invented by the director himself) and using them in a clever, if self-referential, way. The point of the movie is, the more you know of this kind of films (pay attention to the rules, stated by geeky film buff Randy), the more chances you have to survive (although you must take into account that the killer has seen the same movies). The in-jokes that would ruin other films are the very cause of Scream&apos;s success, with memorable scenes such as the villain mimicking the movie his victims are watching or Craven&apos;s unmissable cameo as a janitor wearing Freddy Krueger&apos;s outfit (not to mention priceless lines like &quot;Movies don&apos;t create psychos, movies make psychos more creative!&quot;).\n\nIn other words, Scream is a smart, effective horror film, which manages to amuse and scare in equal measures. Definitely worth watching, even if the two sequels (especially Scream 3) don&apos;t really match the original&apos;s intelligence and, forgive the expression, originality.",

The film strikes a unique and clever balance between exploring new comedic ideas and continuing the themes from the first installment, as it maintains its core story but also offers enough twists to create new excitement. Although the storyline is very much similar to the first film, it does seem fresh and original at the same time, which creates a sequel that can be differentiated from others, as the plot is not merely redesigned in an awkward and uninteresting way. But perhaps the film&apos;s dominant feature continues to be the strong chemistry between the two leading men, who again combine their talents to create the ultimate comedy team. Overall this comedy sequel stands out due to its ability to embrace the success of the its predecessor, as 22 Jump Street uses the power of repetition to recreate the unique comedic atmosphere, which allows the film to establish a very distinct comedy series.",

      "name": "Dark and moody; but with a sense of humour, and real cinematic imagination",
      "reviewBody": "Although today it can be seen as something of a flawed work - compromised somewhat by continual studio interference - Burton&apos;s first Batman film (1989) remains a surprisingly vivid comic-book style action adventure film, peppered throughout by the director&apos;s continual quirks and characteristics, which for me, makes the experience all the more unique. I know it&apos;s almost the accepted opinion these days to reject Burton&apos;s vision, post Batman Begins (2004); with many critics dismissing this as closer in tone to the retro 60&apos;s TV series, which is bull, as we all know. At the time, this was considered the darkest knight of all, and the continual shift into more violent and lurid psychological territory presented by its sequel, Batman Returns (1992), saw Burton dismissed from the series indefinitely. Although Nolan&apos;s subsequent Batman films have attempted to take the franchise into more credible areas - and with great success - they for me lack that certain spark of imagination and subversive sense of humour that made the Burton films so radical and so much fun.\n\nHere, the world of Batman - as presented by Burton - gives the film much of its power. Whereas previous adaptations of the character had placed him within the context of a recognisable present-day environment, this Batman creates a dark, Gothic underworld that is part Metropolis (1927), part Gilliam&apos;s Brazil (1985). You could also argue that there&apos;s a touch of Blade Runner (1982) presented here as well, with the retro-futurist look of distressed exteriors and Art Nouveau creating an odd juxtaposition; suggesting an almost timeless setting that is falling rapidly into despair. With these references in place, Burton goes wild with strokes of German Expressionism and references to film-noir, as he plays not only with an excellent use of shadow and composition, but also with a sly and irreverent use of colour. For example, with this presentation of the Joker (still a contentious factor for some viewers), Burton gives us a screaming, pop-art inspired lunatic - again, part Warhol, part Edward G. Robinson - with the typical charm and caddish likability that only Nicholson could truly convey.\n\nI have no problem with this presentation of the joker. Ledger&apos;s variation exists in a different world with a completely different tone, so such comparisons are ultimately faulty! The only similarity is that in both films the Joker dominates the proceedings, more so than Batman himself. In Nicholson&apos;s hands, the Joker is dangerous *and* amusing; his charm combined with his insanity making him even more fascinating. He is, as he proclaims, an &quot;artist&quot;; someone willing to disfigure their own fiancé for the purposes of creative expression. &quot;I create art until someone dies&quot;, he says, and we believe him. The introduction to the Joker - post-transformation - is still a completely iconic scene, as he aggressively demands a mirror from his plastic surgeons and then smashes it in a fit of mad giggles and inevitable hysterics. This scene - like the following one in which he reaps revenge on a former partner that betrayed him - is straight out of the best of post-war Noir. Admittedly, Batman, by comparison, seems less interesting; with the limitations of a character who essentially hinges around the absurd idea of dressing up in a rubber costume and fighting crime, always requiring a great leap of faith on the part of the audience, as he is forced to become even more brooding and serious in order to remain somewhat plausible.\n\nRegardless of what more obsessive comic-book fans might suggest, I thought the style of this film - with its use of framing and composition - was pure comic-strip. It&apos;s not a graphic novel adaptation, but a proper comic book style adventure; with the skewed angles and tight editing creating that feel of reading from one panel to the next. It benefits from the team that Burton surrounds himself with, from the cinematographer Roger Pratt, who shot the aforementioned Brazil and turned the seedy side of London into a screaming inferno for Neil Jordan&apos;s great film Mona Lisa (1986), as well as composer Danny Elfman and the late production designer Anton Furst. The only thing that really lets us down are a couple of somewhat dated optical effect shots, such as the introduction of Batman looking down on the city from a high-rise tower block, to some obvious miniature work that probably ties in with Burton&apos;s fondness for the work of Ray Harryhausen or director Mario Bava. Nonetheless, these are minor flaws that we face in numerous films and ones that are easily overlooked.\n\nUltimately, the argument of realism offered by many detractors of Burton&apos;s Batman films makes very little sense; again, we&apos;re talking about a film in which a billionaire playboy dons a head-to-toe rubber costume and fights crime at night - how much more plausible can this get? Burton&apos;s approach to Batman, drawing on some of the more revisionist comic book works of Frank Miller and Alan Moore, conveyed a darker, more personal slant to the character, but still retained that sense of colour, fun and imagination that the more recent Batman films seem to have lost. They&apos;re still great films, but for me, the two Batman projects from Burton capture the spirit and tone of the character perfectly, as well as conveying a naturally intuitive approach to film-making that resulted in some genuinely interesting cinematic work. The follow up, Batman Returns would be even better, and remains probably my favourite Batman film, if not my favourite Tim Burton film of all time."

      "reviewBody": "Someone calling himself Simon detonates several bombs in the centre of New York City.  He then sets a series of dangerous tasks for Officer John McClane to achieve or he will detonate more.  McClane sets out to meet the demands of the terrorists with bystander Zeus Carver in tow.\n\nThis is the third in the Die Hard series and it makes an immediate improvement on the second by bringing back the original director John McTiernan.  Here the film doesn&apos;t try to repeat the formula of the first film (terrorists/wife/rescue) but instead takes on a whole new plot while still tying it into the first film.  The second movie tried to repeat the first film&apos;s plot but set in an airport, here the different angle makes this feel a lot fresher and feel like a movie in itself.  The tie-in to the first film is clever and not too much of a stretch of the imagination - happily this is not the reason for the action itself - instead the terrorist&apos;s main aim is the gold held in vaults in the Federal Reserve on Wall Street, but the game with McClane is a special treat.\n\nMcTiernan was great in the first film, making everything feel tense and claustrophobic.  Here he has the whole of NYC to run across and the camera shows this new found freedom.  In action scenes the camera swings wildly round and zooms into focus on the action.  During scenes set in offices etc containing a lot of dialogue the camera slowly prowls round like it&apos;s dieing to rush off to the next action scene.  It&apos;s the opposite to the style in the first film and again makes this feels different enough to be a film in it&apos;s own right.\n\nUsually film series can get a lot of baggage (watch Lethal Weapon 4 for proof), but here all the repeat characters are dropped, even McClane&apos;s wife only features as a voice on the phone.  And that works well here and the only characters that are brought back here are McClane (of course) and Hans Gruber (in a flashback).  This frees the film up to basically go where it wants without having to squeeze in old characters the way the second film did.  However it links the films by having Simon Gruber taking supposed revenge for the death of his brother.  The fresh active feel to this movie really gives it life and lifts the series out of the hole that the second film had threatened to put it.\n\nThe chemistry between Willis and Jackson is great and lends a lot of comedy to the film, there&apos;s lot of racial humour between the two and Jackson is more than the &quot;black sidekick&quot; that exists in many films.  Irons continues the fine tradition of English actors playing Hollywood villains and is good for the most.  His ticks and stutters stop him being anywhere near as good as Rickman was in the original role but he&apos;s still good.  Willis gets good support from the likes of Graham Greene, Larry Bryggman and Colleen Camp as fellow cops but really him and Jackson carry the show.\n\nSome of the scenes are a little forced and the plot doesn&apos;t always join together easily (a scene where Willis is fired out of a water pipe just as Jackson happens to drive by is a little too convenient) but many iffy bits can be overlooked if you focus on the action.  The most effective thing that returns from the first film is the musical score.  In the first film the score used variations on Christmas music to dramatic effect, here the score uses music well to add tension and comedy in a different way.  It&apos;s difficult to put into words but this effect was missing from the second film.\n\nThe film has a hatful of nice twists towards the end and the only problem is that the conclusion in Canada doesn&apos;t feel like it fits in (the original ending was changed following the Okalahoma bombing) but this is a minor problem in a film that is a great addition to the action packed Die Hard series."

I really wasn&apos;t sure what to expect out of this sequel but the very, very, very last thing I did expect was something boring. I must admit that I was really shocked to see how bland and downright bad this movie was as sadly it&apos;s yet another example of a sequel to a good movie being about nothing more than money. The original film was smart, clever and funny in regards to the subject matter but this sequel just lacks any sort of originality and it&apos;s really nothing more than a copy of the original. What&apos;s so sad is that there could have been so many good and interesting story ideas but sadly we&apos;re just given a copy of the first film and we even get many of the same jokes. It&apos;s funny to think that the jokes worked so well the first time but here they&apos;re just annoying and unfunny. I think the majority of the blame has to go towards the screenplay, which is just a mess. It&apos;s never funny, never makes too much sense and sadly it&apos;s clear that very little went into it. The performances outside of Tommy Lee Jones really aren&apos;t all that memorable either. Lara Flynn Boyle has no problems looking sexy but her character is bland. Rip Torn isn&apos;t given much to do and the same is true for Johnny Knoxville and Rosario Dawson. The incredibly bad love story with Dawson is just an embarrassment. MEN IN BLACK II even features some very poor CGI effects and in the end this is just a rather worthless movie that isn&apos;t worth the trouble."

      "reviewBody": "Putting it bluntly, &apos;WANTED&apos; was a rather formulaic and predictable outing. A loserly, office shut-in with the help of a hot babe learns about his past and is suddenly thrust into the world of assassination, a world of flipping cars, extreme gun fights, and mind-altering stunts, thus shedding every bit of his shy, weak self. This we&apos;ve all seen before.\n\nWhere &apos;WANTED&apos; stands apart from any other action film I&apos;ve seen is in its style. The director has upped the ante on how the action is portrayed. Gone are any sort of boundaries. This is a world where people can flawlessly flip cars over others and land perfectly upright on the other side, where people can shoot from miles away hitting nothing but their target, where people can put such a curve on bullets that they hit multiple targets standing on different planes all with one shot. If people can really do this, perhaps I&apos;m living the same existence as Wesley, and I&apos;m missing out. The film&apos;s major selling point is its style and its worth a viewing simply for that.\n\nThe A-List cast delivers solid performances, but the script they are given - with the exception of the last line uttered in the film - is mostly generic. James McAvoy is sympathetic and relatable as the guy who is overwhelmingly bored with his life but doesn&apos;t know how to change it - something many people understand. His transformation into tough guy is effortless and convincing. Angelina Jolie is Fox - a name quite fitting as Jolie looks fantastic; however, we&apos;ve seen this character on her before. Still, she does it well. Freeman, as usual, injects intelligence into his role, playing the solemn leader of The Fraternity.\n\nHowever, for all the edgy extreme events the film contains, the film is hurt by some pieces that are just plain odd and are never fully explained. For one, The Fraternity gets their targets from a secret code that is woven into tapestries by The Loom of Fate. Sounding like something from a Monty Python sketch, it is never revealed who - if anyone - controls the loom or where it derives its powers. Names are simply revealed through code and the members of The Fraternity don&apos;t ask questions. The members of The Fraternity are fully human, but seemingly invincible thanks to some sort of special wax bath devised to heal wounds very quickly. It&apos;s the film&apos;s easy out that allows them to deliver the goods on all the high-octane action they desire. Lastly, the film turns a very predictable corner that many will see coming from miles away.\n\nWhen the film ends you will realize how simple it is and how ridiculous it is about 75% of the time, but you won&apos;t care. The film makes up for every flaw by smearing the screen with mind-bending stunts, unique filmography, and breathtaking visuals - yes, Ms. Jolie is one of them. It will be painfully obvious that all the simple plot details were just the framework and the real substance of the film lies not in its intricate story, but in the execution of its stunts and action. 7/10.",

The plot is great; fairly psychological and quite interesting. It has a fast(and remarkably even) pace, I don&apos;t think more than 30 minutes passes at any point in the movie without a giant action scene. All in all, I&apos;d guess there are about four or five major shootouts, and two chase scenes which are each several minutes long(without getting repetitive, fortunately). The acting is excellent; every single major part is well-played. John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Joan Allen, Alessandro Nivola, Gina Gershon, Dominique Swain... all give great, entirely believable performances. The best are definitely Travolta and Cage, though; fantastic, truly stellar performances. The characters are all well-written and credible, right down to the most minor one. The action is cool and very stylish, in every single action-scene. The theme of the film is great; of course, the story is completely unlikely, with the face-switching and all, but once you get past that, once you suspend disbelief, you&apos;ll most likely enjoy the film thoroughly. The script is excellent, plenty of action, drama, and thriller parts. Also, you gotta love the sharp contrast 3/4&apos;s into the movie, with the kid listening to sugary pop-music, while people are shooting intensely at each other. Great film. I recommend it to any fan of John Woo, Nicholas Cage, John Travolta and action films. 8/10",

After watching the Descendents, I knew Woodley was going places. She simply delivers in this movie. I&apos;m not going to write a long winded review about the summary, but I will tell you about the acting.\n\nElgort and Woodley truly deliver. You forget they&apos;re acting each and every scene. The chemistry between the two is palpable. Laura Dern comes out of nowhere; I think the last time I&apos;ve seen her face was JP. She puts up a pretty good role as Woodley&apos;s torn mother. Defoe is pure love/hate on almost a House level. In fact, he goes beyond House hatred with his apathy in this movie. And the two&apos;s sidekick (Wolff) is loads of comic relief, which is surprising considering that he too is in the therapy group. The rest of the cast is just kind of there (sorry Tramell). But that&apos;s because the camera is on Woodley and Elgort the entire time. I don&apos;t even think there&apos;s a scene except for flashbacks where the two are absent.\n\nAs far as the movie... An emotional roller-coaster. You will get addicted to their relationship. You will cry big man tears internally (and probably externally) after 1.5 hours. You will be emotionally drained.",

      "reviewBody": "A hiking and climbing trip in the mountains of Utah goes wrong for rock-climber Aron Ralston (James Franco) as a loose boulder falls and crushes his arm against the rock wall. Equipped with a half-empty bottle of water, a digital camera, some rope and a (very) dull blade, Ralston must take stock of the situation and figure out a way to escape.\n\nThe film is tight, pacey and not nearly as boring as it could have been in the hands of a more literal director. Danny Boyle and co. infuse every scene with energy, wowing viewers with panoramic cinematography and drilling the hard truths home when the time comes.\n\nRalston gets his arm trapped a mere 15 minutes in and from then on it&apos;s Man vs. Rock. Boyle brings his distinctive brand of energy to the potentially static set-up, with an unpredictable and often inspired soundtrack and the surreal tangents so successfully employed in his early classic, &apos;Trainspotting&apos;. Though Ralston himself may not move, his mind wanders through old memories and viewers are transported with him.\n\nBoyle has a talent for finding the life-affirming elements hidden deep within grim situations and &apos;127 Hours&apos; is nothing if not an exercise in hope and determination. Franco tracks Ralston&apos;s fight over the days with a sense of realism that brings the climber&apos;s plight into sharp focus, ensuring that there is much more to this film than limb-hacking.\n\nThe premise is handled well and the cast and crew know the strengths of the story; the scenery is beautiful and the human elements are as familiar as they are sad, brave and ultimately liberating. When the time comes, having accompanied Ralston through his trials and setbacks, you will be there with him when the helicopter lands.",

      "reviewBody": "Review: I really thought that this was going to be a typical Disney movie about fairies and magic dust, but I really enjoyed it. Although the storyline is based around Sleeping Beauty, I found it quite dark with some adult content. The CGI throughout the movie looked impressive and Angelina Jolie played her part extremely well. After being betrayed by her loved one, she turns quite evil and full of hate, but once Aurora comes into the picture, you get to see an inner sweetness which made her character entertaining and a joy to watch. Pieced together with Sharlto Copley playing the villain, this movie really did have every aspect covered and I&apos;m not surprised that it made so much money at the box office. A Great Watch!\n\nRound-Up: Angelina Jolie really doesn&apos;t make that many movies anymore, but when she comes out of the woodwork, she really does come out with some good movies. From Changeling to the action packed Wanted, she really does have a versatile acting ethic and with all of her charitable work and her hectic family life, I&apos;m not surprised that making movies is low down on her priority list. I liked the chemistry between her character and Sam Riley, who played the crow, and the action scenes were very well thought out by the director. Personally, I don&apos;t think that it&apos;s a movie for the young ones because there are some scenes that will give them nightmares, but there are some scenes they will enjoy, like her magical land and the amazing creatures. In all, I&apos;m surprised that I enjoyed the movie because I really wasn&apos;t expecting something so dark.\n\nBudget: $180million Worldwide Gross: $757million (WOW!)\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there Disney movies which are based on the concept of Cinderella. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "At a time when horror films constitute silly teenagers blindly wandering into danger and unnecessary gore, &apos;The Others&apos; is like a breath of fresh air. It goes back to the roots of the horror genre, employing an eerie atmosphere and mysterious characters to conjure the chilly backbone of the film.\n\n&apos;The Others&apos; is set in the Forties and revolves around staunchly Catholic Grace Stewart, who lives in an old mansion located on the island of Jersey with her highly photo-sensitive children ten-year-old Anne and six-year-old Nicholas. The house is almost permanently entrenched in darkness, in deference to the children&apos;s condition, and Grace&apos;s husband is lost in war, only enhancing the sense of gloom to the story. One morning, three servants mysteriously turn up at the door of the Stewart mansion, despite Grace having not yet advertised the posts, to replace the previous servants who had suddenly left their posts a week earlier. Anne then begins to maintain the house is haunted, her deduction supported by the fact locked doors left ajar, closed curtains suddenly being found opened and furniture moving when there&apos;s no-one in the room. Grace, deeply ingrained in her religious belief that ghosts don&apos;t exist, initially refuses to believe her daughter but soon she questions her faith as she can&apos;t deny there is something ominous about the house...\n\nNicole Kidman gives an excellent performance as the almost cold and aloof Grace, who does love her children dearly even if she doesn&apos;t always show it openly. Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy, as the three servants, are suitably mysterious by showing they seem to know more than they let on, leaving viewers questioning their motives from the start. But it is the young child actors, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, who steal the show as Anne and Nicholas. Despite their age and inexperience, both children given first-class depictions of their characters, showing their isolation thanks to their medical conditions and their reliance on one another despite typical sibling discord at times. Mann, in particular, excels in portraying the stubborn nature of Anne and her precarious relationship with her mother. It is a shame this child never continued her acting career because she is a credit to young British acting.\n\n&apos;The Others&apos; is a subtle horror films for those sick of cheap Hollywood horror flicks and are seeking interesting characters and an intelligent plot. While there are no special effects or buckets of blood in this film, in the tradition of &apos;The Exorcist&apos; and &apos;The Devil&apos;s Backbone&apos;, it instead relies upon more old-fashion methods of frightening the audience, which are far more effective. The story is well-paced, leaving the audience guessing what is happening and what the characters&apos; motives are right to the end.\n\nThis film has to be one of the best horror films I&apos;ve ever seen and puts many films in the horror genre to shame. I highly recommend it to those who appreciate the value of suspense and a good fright."

      "name": "With Inside Man, Spike Lee has crafted a very original and exciting thriller.",
      "reviewBody": "Spike Lee is one of the most consistent directors out there. Save for some more uneven pictures like She Hate Me and Girl 6, Lee&apos;s body of work is just plain impressive. And while Inside Man is not up there with Do The Right Thing, Clockers and 25th Hour, it is definitely an entertaining and intelligent thriller that does things a little differently than most cookie cutter thrillers you see in theaters nowadays.\n\nA bank robbery in New York has gotten out of control, and it&apos;s up to police detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) to act as hostage negotiator and get the bank personal and customers out safely before things turn even worse than they already are. This turns out to be a tough case, since the leader of the bank robbers, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), turns out to be a very smart individual, who has everything planned to perfection, and who throws up surprise after surprise for Frazier and his men. But while the people around Frazier are slowly getting more and more nervous, he himself does not lose his mind, and begins a high stakes battle of wits with Russell. Things are further complicated, however, when the mayor of New York introduces a mysterious woman to Frazier. This woman (Jodie Foster) wants to protect something that is hidden in one of the safety deposit boxes inside the bank, and she will stop at nothing to force Frazier to let her inside the bank and make sure nothing happens to the contents.\n\nThis all sounds like an intriguing premise for a thriller, but the movie goes a few steps further than just having an interesting plot. Because while Inside Man does hit all the right notes when it comes to keeping you guessing about what is really going on, it is also very successful in mixing the grittier moments with comedy elements. At times, Inside Man is very funny, but in a way that does not deflate the tension. The dialogue is sharp, with the conversations between Frazier and Russell being especially fascinating, and both actors are at the top of their game in this new movie. Washington&apos;s Frazier is an intense but laconic individual, who has a permanent smirk on his face but who reads the bank robbers intentions better than anybody else, while Owen is charismatic and fascinating as the mastermind behind the bank robbery. I was a little disappointed however with Jodie Foster&apos;s role. While her part is potentially fascinating, she does not really get the chance to do anything with it other than look cool and act tough. Yes, we all know that she is very good at that, but with a bit more background story, and a bit more screen time, her part could have been even more interesting.\n\nWith Inside Man, Lee showcases an interesting way of directing thrillers. He ignores the usual build up that you see in thrillers, which consists of an introduction, a chronological development of the main intrigue, followed by a final act in which everything is wrapped up neatly (even flashing forward several times, thus revealing some important developments before they have happened), and this only serves to make Inside Man a movie that is more than your regular suspense movie. I enjoyed this original approach very much, even though he does take quite a long time to wrap things up at the end.",

MI:II is must not be considered an MI movie, but this one here builds the foundation to take the series further. We get an insight of Hunt&apos;s life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt&apos;s dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films. The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt&apos;s super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building. Got to say, Hunt is very lucky to survive so many life and death situation.\n\nThe acting was on point, the other characters other than Hunt hadn&apos;t have any significant challenges in acting considering the calibre of them. Tom Cruise grew as an actor and it showed if his performance from first two filmshas to be considered. I wish the movie was less predictable and avoided the cliches. It&apos;s a good movie to pass your time.",

Those people who wrote those might want to try watching movies from a long ways back were they did put out some good movies but also put out tons of trash. This is most certainly not trash. It&apos;s pretty good. Decent humor, good action and a good story. Pacing and some of the dialogue is subpar. I will Also say that its run time is a bit much. I actually enjoyed this movie though and I&apos;m very much not disappointed or think that it was a waste of time. It&apos;s a very unique take on the internals. I will say that Sercy and Icarus chemistry could&apos;ve been better. It has its flaws but if you want to sit back and watch a unique interpretation of a comic book Then give it a shot.",

Its nonlinear narrative, dreamlike atmosphere, and enigmatic storytelling are often praised.

Naomi Watts and Laura Harring's performances are highlighted for depth and emotional resonance.

      "reviewBody": "I feel it&apos;s hypocritical to call a movie a &quot;masterpiece&quot; (which this is), while at the same time slapping it a bit for the very essence of what it is and tries to achieve... but that&apos;s what keeps this from being a &quot;10&quot; for me. Because, after watching and then exhaustingly reading about the film (and understanding more about it that way), it&apos;s pretty obvious that many/most people won&apos;t &quot;get it&quot; fully the first time... and that detracts a little... even though the complexities are what ultimately makes it great. Does that make sense?\n\nIt&apos;s a Catch-22. You can&apos;t KNOW about it before you start... that would ruin the presentation... and yet there&apos;s a very legit chance you won&apos;t fully understand it either if you go in cold. It needs either a 2nd viewing, or the post-movie research to understand (if you&apos;re willing to do that, and even if you DO, you&apos;re going to want to watch it again anyway). All the clues are there and it all makes sense, once you know. But it is so intentionally deceptive, it&apos;s hard to know what you don&apos;t know.\n\nBut it&apos;s brilliant, artistic, evocative, and clever. It slaps hard at Hollywood and the dream machine, and the disillusionment of aspiration. There is quite simply nothing like it. It has been called &quot;the best film of the 21st Century,&quot; and I won&apos;t dispute that. But it IS hard to follow and understand and demands more of the viewer than almost any film I&apos;ve ever seen. So I&apos;d say watch it, draw your own conclusions, read about it, hear what others think and believe... and then watch it again. You will be rewarded\n\nBut there is no denying that it is absolute brilliance, and David Lynch&apos;s crowning achievement.",

      "reviewBody": "Roland Emmerich was armed with a $200 million budget, and this is what it produced. It&apos;s an easy film to dislike from an intellectual level, artistically as well, while the science fiction boffins no doubt had kittens where the science was concerned. It&apos;s also easily one hour too long in length, and come the second half of the marathon it starts to sag. There&apos;s only so many times you can watch your lead protagonists escape crumbling carnage - via various modes of transport - before the fun factor begins to wane. However.\n\nThe carnage effects are grade &quot;A&quot; stuff, eye popping and ear splintering, Emmerich is a master at this sort of thing, and with a likable cast comfortably chewing through the safe disaster film making screenplay, it&apos;s a very decent popcorn blockbuster. It also isn&apos;t afraid to explore some dark moments, all of which - while not all being a surprise - strike strong emotional chords. It knows its disaster movie roots and is happy to tug on them.\n\n2012 made a $500 million profit, that&apos;s a figure not to be ignored. The blockbuster movie loving public lapped it up, they often love this stuff, they just want to see the world exploding and chases and crashes and humans imploding or being heroic. If you have to strip it bare on any sort of cerebral level, then of course it&apos;s naked. But fully clothed, attired purely in modern film popcorn clobber, then it&apos;s grand dramatic and exciting fun. And this even as you have to massage your buttocks at the two hour mark. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "I regretted missing the theatrical experience of Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018) having heard the resounding acclaim surrounding it. It stood atop my watchlist, and my expectations soared accordingly. My recent binge of the MI series (considering I didn&apos;t want to miss 7A: The Dead Reckoning in theatres), with Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation impressing me to a great extent, amplified my expectations for Fallout, the part 6.\n\nFallout commenced admirably, yet the pacing felt sluggish compared to its predecessors. While the motorcycle stunts and visuals were impressive, I felt, they couldn&apos;t match the magnificence of Ghost Protocol. Despite the suspense building in the second half, it fell short of entirely meeting my heightened expectations.\n\nEthan Hunt, as always, astounded with his heroic persona, though Benji&apos;s charm appeared somewhat lackluster in comparison to the previous installments. The absence of Jeremy Renner was felt keenly.\n\nNonetheless, the climax redeemed the film, elevating it to exceptional heights, particularly with the awe-inspiring stunts and visuals in the final 15 minutes, including the remarkable heist in France.\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout (2018) delivers moments of brilliance, but I felt it leaves some unfulfilled promises, making it a mixed bag of excitement and suspense.\n\nPS: I have written the review for all the M:I movies. Thank you!",

The characters are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the directing is great. Mexico City feels alive , it looks like Mexico city, it smells like Mexico city. Everything is portrayed brilliantly . the style of direction was something I enjoyed and brought the best out of Mexico City\n\nThis is one of those films you&apos;ll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you&apos;ll beg your family and friends to watch. From start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist, making it a roller-coaster journey. There enough action to keep you happy, there enough character development to please you and then there&apos;s Washington to bring a smile to your face . Watch this film, you won&apos;t be disappointed",

      "reviewBody": "Stanley Kubrick&apos;s final film is perhaps the first of its kind: it is the only film I have watched that exists within the state of death itself. It&apos;s no surprise; Stanley Kubrick died 4 days after submitting the final print into Warner Bros., Sydney Pollock died in 2008 and my grandparents, who saw this film at a screening in 1999, are dead. However, these aren&apos;t merely the reasons this film evokes a death-like state, this film evokes a death-like state throughout Bill Harford&apos;s sexual odyssey. During the Masonic orgy, which is arguably the film&apos;s center-piece, women are used and discarded as corpses who are only valued for their material gain. This film is shroud in ultra-violet blue, especially at the end of the film where it accentuates the characters&apos; trembling flesh and vulnerable humanity, and the powerful red which contrasts against this blue reflects one of Kubrick&apos;s favorite themes: dominance. Perhaps it&apos;s inexplicable that Eyes Wide Shut evokes a man&apos;s dying thoughts. Ironically, this film feels more fresh and timeless than many of its contemporaries, only reaffirming the inestimable value of Kubrick&apos;s contributions to cinema and a decade of a cinematic drought aptly followed his death. It was fashionable to deride Stanley Kubrick&apos;s final film during its theatrical run, regardless of the fact that he considered it his personal favorite. It seems that the audience expected Kubrick to inundate them with gratuitous eroticism as opposed to ideas. Yet, Eyes Wide Shut has outsmarted time and the film industry itself. It was almost incongruously released a week before American Pie and the abysmal Will Smith star vehicle Wild Wild West. It continues to hold a mere 7.2/10 on IMDb in contrast to escapist science-fiction film The Matrix which holds an 8.7/10 rating and is listed in the top 30 films of all time, above Kubrick&apos;s more cerebral science-fiction classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. All of this may be due to the fact that Kubrick argued that &apos;Observancy is a dying art&apos; and Eyes Wide Shut requires an attention to detail and an attention span that transcends the average summer blockbuster; it&apos;s easy to get lost in the terrifying labyrinth of Kubrick&apos;s musings. Though, unlike other films, Kubrick&apos;s Eyes Wide Shut refutes the transcendent imagery and magic that is featured in the majority of Kubrick&apos;s films, even in Eyes Wide Shut itself, and strips humanity down to its fragile human core, figuratively speaking; Kubrick comes to the conclusion that when man is confronted with the cold and harsh reality, he favors comforting self-delusion and blissful ignorance.\n\nSydney Pollock&apos;s Ziegler argues, during his amazing final monologue, that the Masonic orgies are practiced by society&apos;s elite which excludes Bill. Bill spends the duration of the film&apos;s first half attempting to engage in infidelity after his wife reveals that she was willing to choose one night with a naval officer over their future. Naturally, this enrages Bill and he spends the night attempting to fulfill his personal need to subjugate his feelings of impotence, sexual and otherwise. Even in the very beginning, when Bill walks with two models, his short stature implicitly denotes his lack of power. Bill is convinced that he has been subjected to a life of domesticity and his wife is responsible; he vows to reaffirm his masculinity. Kubrick paints long shots of New York at midnight which is designed to inspire the viewer with dread. Almost every single beautiful shot capturing the very essence of soft, warm colors in the beginning soon descends into the dark and strong colors that reflect the very dream-state many describe when they watch this film. Yet, to me, it evokes a foreboding death-like state which suggests impending doom. \n\nBill&apos;s quest for reaffirmation of his masculinity only renders him emasculated when he enters a Masonic orgy and is rendered socially powerless by a group of the masked elite. Bill&apos;s journey neither leads him towards enlightenment nor satisfaction but humiliation and understanding that he has been domesticated by the higher classes. Ironically, his quest for sexual empowerment only led him to the understanding of social domesticity; Bill is not as influential or elite as he had initially anticipated. Not unlike the elite&apos;s perception of women; they use the high-class prostitutes as objects valued for their material value which reflects their perception of the masses that are responsible for their success. As in the beginning, when Ziegler needs Bill to revive a dying woman who almost overdoses on a combination of cocaine and heroin, Ziegler values Bill for his medical expertise which prevented trouble with the law rather than his personality. Kubrick&apos;s film argues that we live in ignorance of others perceptions of us and this is the ultimate existential fear of Harford; the elite have seen Harford unmasked, vulnerable and exposed. Pollock says &apos;If you knew who was there, you wouldn&apos;t sleep so well.&apos; Kubrick has finally exposed man for who he really is; vulnerable and ignorant of the mysterious forces which govern him. The final and most playfully complex of cinema&apos;s closing lines concludes that Bill and Alice Harford have learned to stop worrying and love the bomb. They refuse to acknowledge their social impotence and would prefer for their eyes to remain wide shut, ignorant to the mysterious forces that govern them. On a more optimistic note, however, perhaps Bill&apos;s odyssey only made him aware of his vulnerability, and Kubrick evokes this through the dark imagery that recreates the sense of subjective paranoia that Bill is experiencing. Bill realizes what ultimately matters: love and family, as opposed to the power which he initially craved but only realized he was at the mercy of others&apos; application of such social power. I&apos;m open to many interpretations of this film, because Kubrick wanted the audience&apos;s eyes to remain wide open soon after they finished experiencing this masterpiece.",

      "reviewBody": "I remember watching this movie, and while I loved the first 2 acts, both full of endless laughter, I couldn&apos;t help but think that Ferris Bueller was something of a narcissist. He does many seemingly selfish things; lying to his parents, humiliating his principal, and putting his &apos;best friend&apos; in danger, all so he can have 7 carefree hours off of school. It is not until the 3rd act that he becomes a 3-dimensional character, and we begin to understand him and realize he is not the sociopath we might have assumed he is. While it seems he does all the things he does for his own pleasure, it becomes clear in the last 20 minutes he was really doing it for his friend. At the beginning of the movie, Cameron is timid, constantly worried, and unsure of himself. We learn his parents argue, and his dad neglects him, and would rather work on his Ferrari instead of spending time with his son. Throughout the movie, Ferris tries to boost his friend&apos;s self-esteem, and by the end, he has succeeded. His friend is a completely different person, and most of the major characters are, notably his sister. However, Ferris doesn&apos;t seem to change at all. He helps his friends become better people, but in doing so, he isn&apos;t changing at all.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always admired this film to a certain extent, but I think the thing that always kept me from loving it was that it never resonated with me emotionally. I would get attached while watching it, but all of those feelings would leave me fairly soon afterward. It had been about five years since I&apos;d seen the film, and in that time I have grown up a lot, fallen in love, had my heart ripped to shreds and fallen back in love again and I think this growth personally has really opened me up to a place in my mind and heart to embrace this film more than most other screen romances that exist. Almost immediately it hit me harder than it had before and after a day since I watched it, the pain and heartache I experienced during it still remains at my core.\n\nIt&apos;s a love film told non-traditionally, but not because it&apos;s two men, that doesn&apos;t even factor into the depiction of it. It&apos;s nontraditional because it&apos;s two people fighting against the love and it&apos;s accuracy in this is startling. How there are times where you can hate the person you love, hate so many things about them and hate that you are in love with them, but you can&apos;t give it up at all. You can&apos;t walk away from it because it&apos;s like an addiction and I think this film more than any before it captures that remarkably.\n\nA lot of this lies in the writing, but of course the performances from Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal certainly play a key factor in capturing it. Their characters take the love in different forms, Ennis fighting himself over it and Jack fighting the world because of it, but both actors capture exactly what they need to and bring this magnetism that really sparks. Gyllenhaal&apos;s openness is beautiful, his determination to make the love work and to just exist the way he wants to, he definitely provides the emotional anchor for the film and gives a heartbreaking portrayal.\n\nIt&apos;s Ledger, of course, who steals the show though, with a kind of transcendent performance that we&apos;re treated to maybe once a decade. He becomes this character in such a vivid way that you don&apos;t even recognize the actor inside the role anymore. Gyllenhaal is Jack and hits the surface notes expertly, but you can still see Jake Gyllenhaal in there. Heath Ledger is completely gone and from the very beginning of the film we have Ennis and we have him until the very end. This character is an incredibly difficult one to take on, he could have easily been someone who was hard to like or sympathize with due to his internalizing and his refusal to fully embrace the relationship and who he is, but that&apos;s what makes it hit even harder, thanks to Ledger&apos;s brutal work.\n\nYou see the pain in this person living a lie in every moment we have with him, with that turned in mouth and speech pattern that always sounds like it&apos;s hurting him to let anything out because he&apos;s afraid of how people are going to react. It&apos;s a performance unlike any other out there and in the end it&apos;s one that brings me to my knees. &quot;Jack, I swear,&quot; was always a line that floored me when I was watching it but now it&apos;s at a point where just thinking of the line and the way that Ledger delivers it brings some water to my eyes.",

      "reviewBody": "General Thoughts:\n\nThe most fun I&apos;ve had in a superhero movie since...well I was going to say Infinity War but that plotline is not very fun. Point is: this movie is fun. It really feels like it was made for kids, with a sprinkling of adult themes here and there. As someone who is suffering from extreme super hero fatigue, this is an excellent film to enjoy without having to put too much thought into it.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe characters do not feel like they make stupid decisions. Every time I was questioning something that was being done, I could essentially chalk it up to the kids being...well kids. The film treats its children like children in the best way. There is no profound philosophical dialogue coming from the mouth of an eight year old. The film was just plain fun.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThere are some minor continuity errors throughout the film that would not distract most people but if you are thinking about the film-making it may take you out of the film for the briefest of moments. Two examples I can think of are characters swapping their locations very quickly (likely in-between takes), and a character flying through the air faster than a plane with absolutely no wind affecting him or his clothing whatsoever. The movie does make up for this with a comical flight scene near the end of the film which I wont spoil.",

It seems he can&apos;t really go wrong; especially when he&apos;s paired with Johnny Depp. Sleepy Hollow is the most visually stunning movie I have seen this year. The production is gorgeous in every way; the cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, the set design is incredible and the way Burton uses the color red to accentuate the lack of color and dreariness otherwise experienced in Sleepy Hollow is a visual treat. This movie is just absolutely beautiful to watch. The performances are flawless, I have to commend Burton for using such a great array of underappreciated character actors, such as Jeffrey Jones and Michael Gough.. and even poor little Casper Van Dien; the man just can&apos;t seem to get any respect (and he doesn&apos;t here either). Ricci is wonderful in a role totally against type, and Depp is refreshing as ever. Christopher Walken is just the coolest guy ever, and as the Headless Horseman he&apos;s even scarier than normal. The best thing, though, is Danny Elfman&apos;s music. Why on earth doesn&apos;t the man have an Oscar yet? What is going on?? He should at least get a nomination for this one.",

What?.\n\nAnyways what i liked is the score and the setting and tom cruise&apos;s acting , but i would be lying if i said i didn&apos;t enjoy the first half because it was intresting but after that &quot;heist&quot; scene which i didn&apos;t consider a heist because of how boring and low quality it was atleast some stuff happened in the film.\n\nAnyways i wanted to watch this to complete the franchies which is kind of a pressure watch so i can finish this whole mission impossible series , still there&apos;s a lot of good films to come from this and i&apos;ve just stumbled upon the worst one probably? 6/10.",

I am not a religious person and this made me feel closer to what people often call God, whatever that is. Maybe I exaggerate, but I want to.

      "reviewBody": "I will start out by saying that &quot;Men in Black 3&quot; is the best of the series so far, at least in my opinion. Why? Well simply because of the depths of the story, it is better planned and executed, and more enjoyable than the previous ones.\n\nThe story &quot;Men in Black 3&quot; is about Agent J traveling back in time to prevent an alien invasion of Earth and to prevent the assassination of his partner, Agent K.\n\nUnlike the previous movies, the various aliens in all their strange appearances do not have that much of a prominent part of the movie. Sure they are there, but mostly as background characters. That is nice in itself, because there is still a large range of strange alien creatures to be seen, just in a less active role in the movie. The story in &quot;Men in Black 3&quot; is more character driven, with focus on Agents J and K in particular, and a single alien, Boris the Animal. This does work out quite nicely, because the story takes on a more personal aspect of storytelling, and there is a really, really great moment towards the end of the movie when you learn the truth about the two agents relationship. That was something that I really enjoyed.\n\nAgain, you have Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones returning to their roles, and then Josh Brolin really pulled off stepping into the shoes of portraying a younger version of Agent K. Boris the Animal was also nicely played by Jemaine Clement. And Emma Thompson stepping in as Agent O, new leader of the MIB agency after Zed having passed on.\n\nAnd as with the previous two movies, the CGI effects in the movie were really great, and the aliens were realistic and believable. Which really is an important thing to make a movie like this enjoyable.\n\nI found this to be the best of the series so far, because it is a more personal story where the multitude of strange alien creatures didn&apos;t have a huge part of the screen all the time. And the depths of the plot were well planned and executed, despite the minor flaws here and there (if you read through the &apos;Goofs&apos; (here on IMDb), but that is really minor details that, I will admit that I didn&apos;t notice at all, you&apos;d notice only if you are a, well, a nerd! No offense to anyone. But you really have to be a perfectionist to factual details to notice that, so hats off to those who pointed them out.\n\nIf you enjoyed &quot;Men in Black&quot; or &quot;Men in Black II&quot;, then you definitely have to watch &quot;Men in Black 3&quot;, because it adds a lot to the overall storyline of the MIB universe.",

It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can&apos;t dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it.\n\nOh and one more thing: from &quot;Jumanji&quot;, I learned the difference between alligators and crocodiles.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s an absurdist parody of neo-noir private detective movies set in 1977 in Los Angeles, California. It follows a barely competent, recently widowed private eye named Holland March (Ryan Gosling) and a bodyguard tough guy named Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe). Holland lives with his 13-year-old daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice), in a rented home since his house blew up from a gas leak that killed his wife.\n\nThey both become involved in a complex plot in which they try to find Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley), a young woman sought by violent men for unclear reasons. As the bizarre plot unfolds, they intersect with Amelia&apos;s mother, Judith (Kim Basinger), a high Justice Department official, and Judith&apos;s assistant, Tally (Yaya DaCosta). They also encounter three hitmen pursuing Amelia--Older Guy (Keith David), Blueface (Beau Knapp), and John Boy (Matt Bomer). A porno star, Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio), also makes a brief appearance at the film&apos;s beginning.\n\n&quot;The Nice Guys&quot; is off-the-wall with lots of physical comedy that borders on cartoonish, making the frequent violence seem less real. Angourie Rice is great as a kid who&apos;s smarter than her father but hampered by higher ethical standards. The script is funny, and Gosling and Crowe carry their roles well. It is pretty sexist. But if you like neo-noir, you may like this take-off.",

The punches, physical and emotional in and out of the ring took me completely by surprise. What didn&apos;t surprise me was Mark Wahlberg&apos;s signature all over the place. Let me explain: Many years ago I was at a lecture by director Martin Donovan when during the Q&amp;A somebody made fun of the fact that Calvin Klein underwear model Marky Mark had played a part (his first acting role) in Donovan&apos;s made for TV &quot;The Substitute&quot; Donovan with elegance, wit and firmness destroyed the guy asking the question, describing Wahlberg&apos;s strengths and ended up saying &quot;Mark Wahlberg will be one of the top actors around and he will probably be running Hollywood within a decade&quot; I had Donovan&apos;s words buzzing in my ears when I sat speechless watching &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. Wahlberg also produced &quot;Entourage&quot; and the startling &quot;In Treatment&quot;. He now produced &quot;The Fighter&quot; and his performance, interior and powerful, dominates the film allowing other members of the cast, to shine in truly showy roles, Christian Bale for instance - really good. Melissa Leo is a stand out as the mother/manager. Superb. So I won&apos;t be surprised to see Mark Wahlberg receiving the top honors at the next Academy Awards, as an actor and producer. He certainly deserves it. Bravo!",

I just sat there waiting for the whole thing to end so I could move on to something else.

The surviving members regroup and convene in L.A. to enact revenge and recapture their gold ... the job is on!\n\nThis could have been a complete disaster, I&apos;m British and the wave of revulsion that boomed in my homeland upon hearing of this remake was explosive; &quot;how dare they remake a British institution&quot; was the cry. Things were not helped in the run up to the film&apos;s release by main star (and draw card) Edward Norton, proclaiming that the film was a contractual obligation and that fans of his work would be better advised to give The Italian Job a miss...\n\nHad to be a stinker then surely? Actually no it isn&apos;t. Director F. Gary Gray hasn&apos;t remade the &quot;Italian Job&quot; of 1969, in fact he hasn&apos;t even re-imaged it, the minis are in there, the gold is in there, but all the stand out moments so beloved by many in the 69 film of the same name are not to be seen at all. So what we get is a very cool heist-come revenge movie, that&apos;s maybe a tad too glossy at times, but it has got a pretty sharp script, tight action sequences and a group of actors working very well as a team. Mark Wahlberg, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Green and the delectably delicious Charlize Theron all come out smelling of roses, whilst Edward Norton really had no cause for concern because his portrayal as Steve is a smarmy delight.\n\nI have jokingly titled this film &quot;Ocean&apos;s 5&quot;, but that is in no way detrimental to &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, it lacks the jazzy coolness of &quot;Soderbergh&apos;s Ocean&apos;s 11&quot;, but it&apos;s a fun and enjoyable picture all in its own right, thus the rating of just under 7 IMDb is actually spot on. 7/10",

      "name": "Essential masterpiece; powerful De Niro; simply one of the best films of all time.",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Raging Bull&quot; isn&apos;t the average, stereotypical underdog boxing movie, because it isn&apos;t really about boxing at all. Like most great movies, its focus is much deeper. It came out in 1980, earned Robert De Niro a Best Actor Academy Award, and was marked down as another solid triumph by director Martin Scorsese, whose previous 1976 outing with De Niro earned them both critical acclaim (and for De Niro, an Oscar nomination, although he would actually earn an Oscar for &quot;Raging Bull&quot; four years later).\n\nIt dwindled in production hell for quite some time, with Scorsese&apos;s drug use halting production and only the duo&apos;s strong willpower that kept the project moving ahead. It was after De Niro read boxer Jake LaMotta&apos;s memoirs that he knew he wanted to make the film, so Scorsese and De Niro turned to Paul Schrader for a script. Schrader, who had previously written &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), agreed, and wrote the screenplay for them. The rest is history.\n\n&quot;Raging Bull&quot; has often been regarded as the greatest film of the 80s. To be honest, I&apos;m not so sure about that, since various genres offer different feelings and emotions (comparing this to a comedy might seem rather silly). But to say it is one of the most powerful films of all time would be no gross overstatement -- it is superb film-making at its finest.\n\nDe Niro gained 60 pounds to play LaMotta, which was an all-time record at the time (later beaten by Vincent D&apos;Onofrio, who gained 70 pounds for Stanley Kubrick&apos;s &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;). His physical transformation is on-par with any great screen makeover, especially the most recent, ranging from Willem Dafoe in &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot; to Charlize Theron in &quot;Monster.&quot; In addition, co-star Joe Pesci also lost weight for his role of Joey, LaMotta&apos;s short, eccentric brother. The greatest scene in the film is when LaMotta accuses his brother of having an affair with his wife. The tension is raw, the dialogue amazing, and the overall intensity electrifying.\n\nThe film is most often compared to &quot;Rocky,&quot; more than any other, apparently because they both concern a certain level of boxing. As much as I absolutely adore &quot;Rocky,&quot; &quot;Raging Bull&quot; is a deeper, more realistic film. But whereas &quot;Raging Bull&quot; is raw, &quot;Rocky&quot; is inspiring, and that is one of the reasons I do not think these two very different motion pictures deserve comparison, for the simple fact that they are entirely separate from one another. The only connecting thread is the apparently central theme of boxing, which is used as a theme in &quot;Rocky,&quot; and a backdrop in &quot;Raging Bull.&quot; They&apos;re entirely different motion pictures -- one uplifting, the other somewhat depressing -- and the people who try to decide which is better need to seriously re-evaluate their reasons for doing so. They both succeed splendidly well at what they are trying to do, and that&apos;s all I have to say about their so-called connection.\n\nDe Niro, who could justifiably be called the greatest actor of all time, is at the top of his game here. In &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; he displayed a top-notch performance. He wasn&apos;t just playing Travis Bickle -- he was Travis Bickle. And here he is Jake LaMotta, the infamous boxer known for his abusive life style and somewhat paranoid delusions during his reign as world middleweight boxing champion, 1949 - 1951. Throughout the film, he beats his wife (played expertly and convincingly by the 19-year-old Cathy Moriarty), convinced that she is cheating on him, and that is more or less what the film is truly about. The boxing is just what he does for a living, and could be considered as a way to release some of his deeper, harbored anger.\n\nLaMotta has a close relationship with Joey, his brother, and their interaction is often what elevates the film above others of its genre. The dialogue is great, close to the perfection of Quentin Tarantino&apos;s &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; rich in that rapid-fire filthy language and brutal insults. Pesci, who was on the verge of quitting showbiz at the time of pre-production, was spotted by De Niro in a cheap B-movie named &quot;The Death Collector&quot; (1975), a.k.a. &quot;Family Business,&quot; a truly horrid film that nevertheless showcased an early sign of things to come for Pesci. De Niro wanted him for the movie and his premonition was either very lucky or very wise -- this is one of the best performances of Pesci&apos;s entire career.\n\nScorsese shot the film in muted black and white, portraying a certain era of depression and misery. To make the blood show up on screen during the occasional fight scenes, Scorsese used Hershey&apos;s Syrup -- which is an interesting tidbit of trivia for any aspiring film-making planning on filming a violent movie in black and white. But how often does that happen?\n\nThis is certainly one of the most intense films Scorsese has directed, and one of the most important of his career. Along with &quot;Taxi Driver,&quot; it is an iconic motion picture that will stand the test of time for years and years to come. \n\nScorsese and De Niro&apos;s partnership over the years has resulted in some of the most influential and utterly amazing motion pictures of all time: &quot;Mean Streets,&quot; &quot;Taxi Driver,&quot; &quot;The King of Comedy,&quot; &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;Casino&quot; come to mind almost instantly. But perhaps the one single title that will be remembered as their most daring effort is &quot;Raging Bull,&quot; a motion picture so utterly exhilarating that it defies description. It is simply a masterpiece for the mind and senses, leaving you knocked out cold after its brutal one-two punch. If I had to assemble a list of required viewing, this would be up there towards the top.",

Wrongly imprisoned, Mr. Depp is in a vengeful mood. He learns his wife has poisoned herself, and left teenage daughter Jayne Wisener (as Johanna) in the clutches of lusty Alan Rickman (as Judge Turpin) and Timothy Spall (as Beadle Bamford). Depp&apos;s sailing companion, young Jamie Campbell Bower (as Anthony Hope) hears Ms. Wisener singing, and falls in love at first listen. And, she is similarly smitten.\n\nMeanwhile, acting like &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, Depp showers himself with the blood of throat-slit victims. His new co-dependent companion, dark-eyed Helena Bonham Carter (as Nellie Lovett), sells meat pies made with the human carcasses Depp provides. &quot;And baby makes three&quot; when Depp and Ms. Bonham Carter &quot;adopt&quot; gin-swigging young teenager Edward &quot;Ed&quot; Sanders (as Tobias &quot;Toby&quot; Ragg), after making tasty mince meat out of his swarthy guardian, Sacha Baron Cohen (as Adolfo Pirelli).\n\nSubtitled &quot;The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, director Tim Burton&apos;s &quot;Sweeny Todd&quot; is more horror opera than Broadway musical. The promotional material says it &quot;has been hailed as a masterpiece by critics and audiences everywhere.&quot; Now, that&apos;s going too far, in this case - but, you know Burton and Depp are going to be attached to something visually arresting, and is certainly so. There is, at least, masterpiece-caliber work from the likes of Colleen Atwood, Dante Ferretti, Francesca Lo Schiavo, and Dariusz Wolski, who will hopefully continue to be seen among the outstanding Burton/Depp crews.\n\n******* Sweeney Todd (12/3/07) Tim Burton ~ Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Jamie Campbell Bower, Ed Sanders",

      "reviewBody": "So the latest in what is becoming a long running sci-fi franchise sees Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) get his prequel movie. Unsurprisingly, such is the ferocious core fan base of the Star Wars series, it has been met with a mixture of outright hatred to pats on the back appreciation. It really is a case here of jumping in to view it on its own terms to at least give it a chance. The truth is, is that if this was a stand alone movie being judged purely as a science fiction action movie, then it would be better appreciated. For this is cracker jack entertainment in that sphere, with superbly constructed worlds inhabited by delirious looking aliens species, feisty droids hold court, and the humans are daring, cheeky and even sexy. It is in short quality and fantastical sci-fi, even if in truth as per the Solo character trajectory it&apos;s safe film making.\n\nWe, as in the royal Star Wars fans we, all have our card carrying belief that our opinion on any Star Wars film is correct, but really the only advice I can honestly give here is that if you haven&apos;t seen it yet then at least give it a chance. Those that have seen it have their minds made up either way, so personally I can only say how much fun I had watching it - twice! All the dots are joined towards the Solo character I love so dear, from back when with childhood eyes in the late 70s I was transfixed on that big screen. How great to see how Han met Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and how their brilliant friendship begins. To witness the birth of the Han/Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover excellent) friendly rivalry - and all that that entails as regards our favourite spaceship - The Millennium Falcon. Yes, I like it well enough for sure, maybe you will as well? 7.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "... Directors of all time. Let&apos;s start with a story. Many years ago, when your grandfather was still a boy, a failed, beaten-down actor named Clint Eastwood packed up his horse and saddle (speaking metaphorically here), left Hollywood forever (or so he thought) and headed out to Europe to pick up cash wherever he could. He ended up doing a film in Italy for an almost-unknown director named Sergio Leone and an almost-unknown sound guy named Ennio Morricone. The film was (as history would later record) an &quot;Italian Western,&quot; that is, as the iconic western drama was all but disappearing in the US, it was being &quot;re-imagined&quot; by Italian writers and directors, and then filmed in Italy, using mainly Italian actors. On the set, Eastwood spoke in English and everyone else spoke in Italian. (Dubbing later fixed all that). Filming now over, Eastwood took his cash and left. Weeks later, in a bar in another part of Europe, he overheard mention that a certain film was the leading box office attraction on the continent. The name sounded familiar but, frankly, during production, a final name for the film he&apos;d just done had not even been selected. He investigated. Yes, this was the film he had just completed, now titled A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. The rest is history. Sort of. Two sequels were done with Eastwood playing the same character. Monster hits.\n\nBy this point the critics began to acknowledge not only Clint, but also the man behind the camera, Leone, who was one of the most promising directors of the era. HE DID THINGS WITH THE CAMERA THAT NO ONE HAS DONE BEFORE OR SINCE, especially his use of closeups, especially his ability to match powerful emotional orchestrals to key scenes. The fourth film in the series, done by Leone but by this time lacking Eastwood, was ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. (Eastwood meanwhile had returned to America as a major celebrity, formed his own production company, Malpaso, and over time became a director as well as the #1 box office star. Over the course of his career, Eastwood subtly voiced his distaste for Leone&apos;s work by scrupulously avoiding all Leone&apos;s trademark camera angles, even in his westerns!)\n\nBack to Leone. While he lent his name to a handful of oddball productions, the last passionate work he left behind as his legacy was this film. OMG. What a film. Showcasing not only Leone&apos;s talent behind the camera, but also his musical magic as well as his ability to tell a complex tale like no one before him. It was by and large produced in obscure locations in NA, and the performances of the players, especially James Woods, and also de Niro, could possibly rank even today as the best they have ever given. (Also a performance from a young and charismatic Jennifer Connolly that by itself is worth the price of the ticket)\n\nThe film is magical. But here is the catch. Very few people have ever seen it. Even people who &quot;think&quot; they have seen it, really have not. The studio behind the film went berserk when they saw the length and, fearful of losing dollars when they could be changing reels and selling more tickets, they brought in a butcher to shorten it. Now maybe the new editor was not a butcher by trade, but he was sure one by disposition. The late Roger Ebert said that, in his career, this was the most abusive re-edit he had ever seen. The actual film, the one that Leone left, was not seen until years later when the director&apos;s version surfaced. It is astounding. It is magical. It is one of the best films ever made. It is a must see.

This was one great flick and it&apos;s one of those movies that seem longer than it actually is.\n\nJohn McClane(Willis)is back. Only this time he&apos;s at Dulles Airport in Washington D.C. waiting for his wife&apos;s plane to arrive. But when McClane stumbles upon a couple of terrorists he tries to warn everyone in the control tower about it. But before they could do anything, the terrorists shut down all of the plane&apos;s landing systems. The terrorist leader led by Col. Stuart(played greatly by William Sadler)is demanding that major foreign drug dealer, General Esperanza is freed. But since the tower is powerless, McClane wages another one man war against the terrorists and must hurry before his wife&apos;s plane crashes.\n\nWillis and Sadler do great jobs in their roles. Dennis Franz also does a funny job as the airport police chief. It has a great return of some old characters such as Bonnie Bedelia, William Atherton, and Reginald VelJohnson.\n\nThis gets my vote as the most entertaining of the three Die Hard movies. 10/10"

      "name": "Awesome and handsome  film set in early 1900&apos;s Vienna about a magician , his lover and a nasty prince",
      "reviewBody": "Imaginative and intriguing flick set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, where takes place a crash of wits between a famous magician , a price and and a Police Inspector . This enjoyable and fresh story about intense rivalry among an ambitious , easy-going magician named Eisenheim (Edward Norton who did many of his own magic tricks, with the coaching of James Freedman) who becomes a prestigious illusionist and get mutual envy , a Police chief (Paul Giamatti) and the heir prince (Rufus Sewel) ; being set in turn-of-the last century , Vienna (although the film is set in Austria, it was filmed mostly in the Czech Republic) . Their escalating cat and mouse feud is played out in palaces , theaters and Vienna streets . Eisenheim (his character is closely based on the magician and supposed clairvoyant Erik Jan Hanussen, who was famous in Vienna in the early part of the 20th century and was murdered by Nazi soldiers in 1933) delivers the most spectacular version of a teleportation trick that calls for something like real magic . The stage illusionist falls in love with a woman well above his social standing . He will use his abilities to secure the love of a gorgeous girl (Jessica Biel replaced Liv Tyler, who dropped out of the film just as filming was about to begin) far above his social standing as the magician use his powers to combat his enemies . The Duchess Von Teschen is soon to be wed to the Crown Prince Leopold in what would be for him a marriage solely in pursuit of power : overthrowing his father, the Emperor Leopold , as well as overtaking the Hungarian side of the empire .\n\nThis splendid movie is stunning in many aspects and blends appropriately various genres : the lush romantic period piece during nineteenth century Victorian Era , mystery thriller and fantasy . The picture gets it all : suspense , mystery drama , star crossed lovers , plot twists , murders ,tragedy , exquisite costumes and supernatural illusions . It inhabits a world between reality and illusion as when Inspector&apos;s investigation develops , it&apos;s amazingly unclear whether the illusionist is the performer of unbelievably excellent tricks or genuine supernatural acts . Explicitly modelled on the pattern of a magic trick , it&apos;s also bound by the rules of the mystery thriller genre . And in devoting so much room to romantic subplot , the picture ends up breaking the magician&apos;s cardinal rules . Featuring an excellent casting, as main actors, Edward Norton , Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti as well as eclectic secondaries , Rufus Sewel , Jake Wood and Eddie Marsan .Although the story is fictional, some of the details are based on the life of Austrian Crown Prince Rudolf, only son of Emperor Franz Josef. The painting of the emperor which Eisenheim creates is an actual portrait of Franz Josef ; the bodies of Rudolf and his mistress, the Baroness Mary Vetsera, were found at his hunting lodge Mayerling on January 30, 1889 in what is now known as the &quot;Mayerling Incident&quot;. This was initially covered up by the Imperial Family, creating controversy and mystery. Luxurious attention to period detail in brilliant costumes and spectacular production design . Beautifully and mesmerizing cinematography by Dick Pope ; too marvelously photographed in a red sepia palette flashed with colorful images . Intriguing as well as evocative musical score by Philip Glass . The motion picture was perfectly directed by innovator director Neal Burger , a filmmaker who has filmed notorious movies such as ¨The lucky ones¨ , ¨Interview with the assassin¨ and his most successful , ¨Limitless¨ . At the same time was made another film (2006) with similar theme about magicians titled ¨The prestige¨ (2006) by Christopher Nolan with Hugh Jackman , Christian Bale and Michael Caine . &apos;The illusionist&apos; results to be a magnificent picture which achieved much success . Rating : Above average, it was throughly amusing and exciting , and no as predictable as you would think . The film turns out to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work , it&apos;s highly recommended and keep you guessing until final\n\n.",

This Jumanji (1995) like growing up tale for an adult male (Ben Stiller) taps into some nice special effects and family value themes that just don&apos;t seem to mesh completely. Ben sometimes ends up with his dumb, silly stereotyped character from earlier films. And the casting of criminal characters are a abit of a disappointing shock for older audience members, especially without warning or clues. The female protagonists in this movie are underdeveloped. With good intent, this fantasy world of a museum coming to life had a lot of excitement, cute scenes but it failed to deliver the potential as a classic family comedy fantasy. Ben Stiller&apos;s development as a character seemed to be uneven and inconsistent. And unlike Jumanji, it seemed to revolve around the exploits of one man, alone who had to grow up. There was some nice plausible explanations for the use of English language, yet even so it was unnecessarily inconsistent. Fun and entertaining, the movie doesn&apos;t reach the levels of its possibilities. Six out of Ten Stars.",

      "reviewBody": "I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I&apos;ve been in that position myself any of a number of times.\n\nThe opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.\n\nThe first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making &quot;Hell&apos;s Angels&quot;. He&apos;s desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell&apos;s Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell&apos;s Angels in 1929. \n\nI thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress&apos;s manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn&apos;s family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn&apos;s ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn&apos;s mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.\n\nSince the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.\n\nThe highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",

      "reviewBody": "Yes Man was a delight to watch. Critics had panned it a bit, but unfairly, in my view. Granted, it is formulaic, but it IS a rom-com, and rom-coms have formulas. What made this film so great was the natural charm of Zooey Deschanel. She is beautiful, of course, but not in a &quot;model-y&quot; kind of way. She has always had a freshness and honesty about her that makes her appealing. When I first saw her in &quot;Almost Famous,&quot; playing the older sister, I wished I had an older sister like that. When she played the girl lead in Big Trouble, she was quirky, but without any of the self-aware conceit that can often accompany quirky young female actors. I will be kind and avoid names, but perhaps you can picture in your mind some of the &quot;Tragically Hip&quot; and oh-so-cool young actresses who do quirk with a smirk. Zooey Deschanel has an innocence and a friendly quality that really make her shine, in the way a flower shines.\n\nJim Carrey was also very good in this. He is who he is--- goofy and loopy and elastic. This wasn&apos;t a &quot;Serious Role,&quot; such as Truman Show serious--- but wasn&apos;t over the top like Ace Ventura. Maybe he&apos;s mellowed with age. I liked him as a wild kid, but like him even more now that he is a bit &quot;evened out.&quot; He is still hilarious--- but also a bit more human, and a bit more approachable.\n\nThis movie runs through its rom-com paces, but each new scene, while a bit predictable, was nonetheless a pleasure. I felt uplifted by the end, and am very glad I went, even in the blizzard occurring where I am now staying. It was worth it!",

Having a real situation that will throw you and others off balance and play it as straight as possible sounds simple, but it really isn&apos;t. You need actors like Mads Mikkelsen to convey the story and be able to portray all the facets of his character.\n\nThe kid actors in this are very important too and as is said in the making of, none were told the whole truth or what the implications might be. Which is especially important to those who might think kids were exposed to things they shouldn&apos;t have been. Which brings us right back to the theme of the movie and the question, if we are over protective or if the world around us has changed too much? There are a lot of other questions too that are raised and not all can be answered with certainty or any satisfying result. Which makes the movie even more disturbing and good.",

      "reviewBody": "Where does a director go after making two colossal worldwide hits?\n\n&quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992) and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994) were two of the greatest movies ever made, and they launched director Quentin Tarantino into the realm of Mainstream Hollywood Director. Most of the time, a director faced with this reality will sink into a slew of really bad movies, but so far Tarantino has been either extremely lucky or extremely talented - his third feature film, although lacking in the brutality of its predecessors, contains just as much wit. Based upon the Elmore Leonard novel &quot;Rum Punch,&quot; it&apos;s packed with the clever dialogue that Leonard is known for in his writing. It&apos;s also got a good amount of style, too. It&apos;s not a typical Tarantino movie, but is that necessarily a bad thing? In this particular instance, no.\n\nJackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight stewardess forced into running jobs for Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), a ruthless criminal who has no respect for life - or death, for that matter. However, during one of her smuggling efforts, a couple of FBI Agents (including Michael Keaton) nab her and offer her a deal: If she helps them get Ordell, she will be let free from custody. The Feds do not know who Ordell is, but they know he exists, and that is where Jackie comes in. She reluctantly agrees to participate in their sting operation, but all is not what it seems. And when $500,000 dollars disappears from his retirement fund, Ordell stops, thinks, and arrives upon the conclusion that we all anticipate with glee: Jackie Brown did it.\n\nHis partner in crime, Louis (the wonderful Robert De Niro), also decides to double-cross Ordell, with the help of a sexy blonde ditz named Melanie (Bridget Fonda), The movie&apos;s twisting plot line and intersecting story lines is very reminiscent of &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; and De Niro&apos;s underrated performance is a real stand-out. The movie&apos;s quite well made and enjoyable.\n\nDon&apos;t misinterpret what I&apos;m saying. This is no &quot;Reservoir Dogs,&quot; nor does it want to be. It&apos;s not in the same vein as Tarantino&apos;s other movies, at least not at a superficial level. However, it is extremely entertaining, helped along by a great cast and a terrific script. The only difference here is that Tarantino did not come up with everything by himself. He adapted the screenplay from another source, something he usually doesn&apos;t do. But there&apos;s also a little-known fact that Roger Avary co-wrote some of &quot;Dogs&quot; and &quot;Fiction&quot; with Tarantino, as well as sparked the idea for some of his films. Here, Quentin adapts Leonard&apos;s novel and does justice. People who say it isn&apos;t as good as his other movies because it&apos;s recycled obviously don&apos;t know what they&apos;re talking about.\n\nTarantino started out as a video store clerk, and is the movie buff&apos;s filmmaker. Not only does Tarantino share a deep passion for films, but he also knows what most of the real movie enthusiasts want. He has yet to disappoint me with any of his directorial efforts. His own life story would make an interesting movie, and indeed it did with &quot;True Romance,&quot; partially based on Tarantino&apos;s own self-image of himself. (A geek working at a comic book store falls in love and goes off of an adventure into a new realm -- in Tarantino&apos;s own case, it was film-making. For Clarence, from &quot;True Romance,&quot; it was drugs and murder.)\n\nTarantino has a flair for raw energy in all of his films, and &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; is no exception. The movie is bursting at its edges, packed with wild antics and the occasional fierce brutality. The movie was criticized by Tarantino&apos;s die-hard fans for being too different from his other films. However, the mistake of many directors is to repeat the same formulas over and over again. One must at least give Tarantino credit for trying new things in each of his films. If anything, the only thing that Tarantino likes to insert into all his films is a large source of energy. And is that a bad thing?\n\n4.5/5 stars."
