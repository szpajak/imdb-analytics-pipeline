This movie set out to be a average comedy about a man who gets the power to wish anything. And this is the core of the movie. Simon Pegg is likable as always and serves as a good hearted doofus who gains extraordinary powers. The jokes are funny, without being too clever or too cheesy. The love story is serviceable without being boring and Rob Riggle who plays a jealous ex is pretty funny. This film doesn&apos;t revolutionize anything but its harmless fun. I enjoyed it and it was nice to hear Robin Williams once more who was pretty funny in the film, but I won&apos;t re watch it soon.",

      "reviewBody": "By 1985, the movie &apos;western&apos; was a genre long dormant, with film critics quick to point out that audiences had become far too &apos;sophisticated&apos; for old-fashioned &quot;shoot-&apos;em-ups&quot;. Two film makers decided to test the waters, however; Clint Eastwood, reviving an older version of his &quot;Man with No Name&quot;, directed and starred in his SHANE homage, PALE RIDER; and Lawrence Kasdan, fresh from the huge success of THE BIG CHILL, fulfilled his life-long dream to make a western, with SILVERADO. Neither film was successful at the box office, and pundits predicted they would soon be forgotten...but a new force in the movie industry was emerging, video rentals, and SILVERADO, with it&apos;s spectacular action sequences, charismatic heroes, and sweeping, unforgettable music score (by Bruce Broughton), was an unexpected and overwhelming hit, drawing Hollywood&apos;s attention to the new market, and lifting the film to the near-classic cult status it enjoys today.\n\nWhile PALE RIDER would focus on Clint Eastwood&apos;s continuing demythologizing of the West (which would culminate in 1992&apos;s UNFORGIVEN), SILVERADO embraces all the &apos;classic&apos; Western clichés, serving them up with such exuberance that they seem &apos;fresh&apos;. The story of four likable &apos;shootists&apos; of nearly superhuman skills, bonding, and ultimately taking on a corrupt sheriff and his brutal gang of deputies in the town of Silverado, trots out one traditional element after another, from the classic &apos;bushwhack&apos; (with a John Ford &apos;Doorway Framing&apos; homage shot) to the &apos;pretty widow&apos; in a wagon train; from the &apos;saloonkeeper with a heart of gold&apos; to the &apos;crooked gambler with a concealed weapon&apos;...and even climaxes with that most traditional of finales, as two ex-partners face off on a dusty street in an old-fashioned Western shootout.\n\nThe four leads couldn&apos;t have been cast more perfectly; Scott Glenn channels Gary Cooper as a laconic cowboy fresh from an undeserved 5-year prison stretch; Kevin Kline exudes his signature charm as an ex-gang member whose life changed because of &quot;a dog&quot;; Danny Glover is warm and reassuring as a man moving west from Chicago to help his family, armed with a legendary Henry rifle; and, best of all, young Kevin Costner, in his breakout performance, is irresistible, wild and acrobatic, as Glenn&apos;s ever-optimistic, carefree younger brother, a part Kasdan wrote specifically for the actor, after his scenes were cut from THE BIG CHILL.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally superb, with standout performances by giant Brian Dennehy, John Cleese (as a sheriff who knows &apos;where&apos; his jurisdiction ends), Jeff Goldblum, Linda Hunt, James Gammon (&quot;You led a posse to my best hide-out??&quot;), Jeff Fahey, and, in a wonderful if brief role, breathtaking Rosanna Arquette, as the widow courted by both Kline and Glenn. With a cast THIS good, it is remarkable that the film had to &apos;go to video&apos; to achieve success!\n\nThe final line of SILVERADO, &quot;We&apos;ll be back!&quot;, shouted by Costner as he and Glenn ride &apos;into the sunset&apos;, has had countless fans wishing that a follow-up movie had been made (a 1999 nationwide video poll chose SILVERADO as the film &quot;Most Deserving of a Sequel&quot;), but time has, sadly, eliminated that possibility. The film that &apos;failed&apos; when released, in a genre that &apos;experts&apos; considered passé, is, after nearly 20 years, still winning new fans.\n\nAs Kevin Kline and Linda Hunt say, as a toast: &quot;Here&apos;s to the good stuff...May it last a long time!&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "His House starts great and it also ends strongly. However, that beginning and that ending feel like they are from two different movies. It&apos;s quite unfortunate that it made me feel that way because I do think that there is a lot of things that this movie gets right.\n\nLet&apos;s start with the first half of the movie. What I would consider the horror half. This film began very quickly and left very little time for the viewer to get situated. The first 45 minutes were indeed very scary, and I was drawn to the screen. But what made that first half so great, was that it didn&apos;t just rely on the usual horror tropes. His House explored themes of racism and all the other challenges that refugees face. These issues were explored in a way that caused tension even outside of the house that works as the centrepiece of the story. Another aspect that created its own horror was distrust and challenges of marriage. This film managed to create an atmosphere of constant terror and tension, and I, for one, really liked it.\n\nThe second half, however, moves into a completely different direction. What started as a pure horror film, shifts more and more into a drama as the run time moves towards its end. The horror changes from the typical haunted house style more into creature horror. That&apos;s also where the movie stopped being scary for me. I have never found creature horror to be particularly scary and this film didn&apos;t change that. I do realize that that is a personal problem, and most people will probably find the second half to be nearly as scary as the first one. But it&apos;s not just the normal horror stuff that changes. The two aforementioned aspects of immigration and marriage are almost completely forgotten about. And it is quite unfortunate that this is the case. I felt that they added so much to this movie and made it more than just another haunted house film.\n\nWith that being said, I did like the second half nearly as much as I liked the first one. His House end up becoming a rather touching drama by the time it finishes. And if it forgot about the challenges of immigration and marriage, it replaced it with the conundrum of whether to leave ones home country in the first place. Although a new home promises a better life, is that always going to be the reality?\n\nThere is a lot to like about His House. I think that it fantastically approached horror by making it about more than just jump scares and a scary atmosphere. I also liked that it was a haunted house film that didn&apos;t take place in an abandoned mansion. And, I also liked the second half with everything it had to offer. The thing that lessened my excitement was the fact that I felt like I ended up watching two different films. Had there been more cohesion between the two halves, I&apos;m certain that I would&apos;ve liked this film quite a bit more.",

      "reviewBody": "In Pasadena, Mrs. Davis (Joanna Cassidy) sends her daughter Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) to Tokyo to bring her sister Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who is interned in a hospital after surviving a fire, back to the USA. After their meeting, Karen dies and Aubrey decides to investigate what happened to her and gets herself cursed in the same situation, being chased by the ghost of the house. Meanwhile in Tokyo, the three high school mates Allison (Arielle Kebbel), Vanessa (Teresa Palmer) and Miyuki (Misako Uno) visit the famous haunted house and are also cursed and chased by the ghost. In Chicago, Trish (Jennifer Beals) moves to the apartment of her boyfriend Bill (Christopher Cousins), who lives with his children, the teenager Lacey (Sarah Roehmer) and boy Jake (Matthew Knight). On the next door, weird things happen with their neighbor.\n\n&quot;The Grudge 2&quot; has scary sound and visual effects, with the creepy woman and boy, and I have startled a couple of times while watching this movie. However, the complex screenplay with three subplots is totally confused, making the entwined story a complete mess. There are too much characters and situations, and in a certain moment I was completely lost with the disconnected and fragmented narrative. In the end, I was completely disappointed with this confused, but also spooky film. My vote is four.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Grito 2&quot; (&quot;The Scream 2&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "A gorgeous looking coming of age story that&apos;s worth watching for the Italian locations alone.\n\nPaolo Sorrentino has been compared to Federico Fellini, and watching this film you can see why. This movie reminded me a lot of Fellini&apos;s &quot;Amarcord,&quot; not necessarily in the specifics but in the general tone and vibe. &quot;The Hand of God&quot; flip flops between gentle comedy and domestic tragedy deftly, and in that way feels a lot like life. It&apos;s about a teenager who&apos;s forced to forge a life for himself and a place in the world when his parents are suddenly and unexpectedly removed from the picture. I&apos;ve also seen it compared to &quot;Call Me by Your Name,&quot; and I can see why, but in many ways it&apos;s a very different kind of movie from that one.\n\nThe family at the film&apos;s center should probably have disgusted me actually since they&apos;re kind of mean. In the film&apos;s first half hour they mock a woman for being fat and a man for having a speech disability. There&apos;s a smugness about them that comes from being part of an insular group where you always know you&apos;ll never be an outsider. It makes the later portion of the film that much more poignant, then, when the main character loses that protection and the big wide world becomes an insular club that excludes him.\n\nThis movie is so laid back that it would be easy to enjoy it without thinking much at all about what it&apos;s also saying. But this is one film that has both beauty and brains.\n\nGrade: A.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the darkest, bleakest films I have seen in a long time. All characters, without any exception, are unhappy souls, surviving in a grim world, unable to improve their lives, prone to an almost genetically determined urge to mess things up. \n\nThe image of rural America this film paints, is almost like that of a third world country. Most men have a cigarette in one hand and a bottle in the other. Dysfunctional families live in decaying shacks, without money or food. Violent dogs are barking everywhere. Disagreements are settled by fistfights or, in some cases, by bullets. The only community centres are a grocery store and a whorehouse. Homeless people are killed for a few dollars and a bottle of liquor. \n\nThe central character is Joe, an outstanding role from Nicolas Cage. He is a loner, living on the edge of society, earning a living by poisoning trees so that they can be removed legally. He hires workers on a daily basis, one of them being a 15 year old kid who regularly gets beaten up by his alcoholic father. They get to like each other, but when the boy seeks Joe&apos;s protection, things get out of hand. \n\nThe main characteristic of the film is the gloomy atmosphere, emphasizing the desolate hopelessness. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is very effective. Above all the part of the boy&apos;s father is worth mentioning. It is played by a local homeless man, who apparently died a few weeks after shooting was finished. \n\nSome reviewers compared &apos;Joe&apos; tot &apos;Mud&apos;. An obvious similarity is Tye Sheridan, who plays the same sort of role in both films, as a young kid who befriends an older man. But to me, &apos;Joe&apos; had much more in common with &apos;Winter&apos;s Bone&apos;. This film was also set in rural America, with Jennifer Lawrence as a teenager trying to keep her dignity in a world of violence and dysfunctional families.",

      "reviewBody": "Food, Inc is essential viewing even though it&apos;s not a great movie. Much like An Inconvenient Truth its facts and accumulation of information trumps style or overall craft. This doesn&apos;t mean that the director isn&apos;t making a bad film or doesn&apos;t have some clever visual cues and transitions or know how to combine interviews and archival footage, since he does. But it&apos;s the precious interviews he gets, and just leaving the theater knowing that American food (or just stretching worldwide) is run by four corporations and that the farming industry as is advertised as &quot;the American Farmer&quot; is in deep trouble.\n\nIt&apos;s separated into sections, and each one has something interesting. The one that got to me personally was the section on chickens, how they, like cows as well, are genetically engineered to get bigger a lot faster than they used to, and how the working conditions are at best hazardous and at worst untenable. We see one woman interviewed, the only one who bucked her corporate bosses, to let the cameras in to the state of the chicken coop. Even if one hasn&apos;t seen a regular chicken coop before, the state of this place, the stark and dark mis-en-scene, gives us a picture of how it is. As someone like myself who likes a good piece of chicken every now and again, it made me about as guilty as imaginable.\n\nBut perhaps that&apos;s part of the point of Food, Inc - get us informed to the point where we&apos;re scared s***less. The downside may be the reach; while Inconvenient Truth had the boost of a Vice President, the big names in this documentary are authors, one of which wrote Fast Food Nation (and, surprisingly, eats a hamburger on camera, from a diner of course, and speaks about how burger and fries are some of his favorite food to eat despite the horrors of the fast food industry). So it&apos;s difficult to say how many people will see this who don&apos;t already have some idea about the atrocious conditions in slaughterhouses, the outbreaks of E-Coli that affect countless people including little Kevin as seen in the film, and Monsanto&apos;s patent of a soybean seed that they genetically altered. Between that last part alone and a little factoid made about Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, it&apos;s no wonder one leaves the theater flabbergasted.\n\nThere is some hope the film provides, however. A Virginia farmer, who treats all of his livestock with care and feeds them right (not copious amounts of CORN, which, by the way, is practically coming out of your ears as you read this), gives a few moments to reflect on how the ideal of the American farmer, of what they can give to the community and how they can try and be reasonable with having to do the inevitable of killing living things for food. Hell, the director even has Wal-Mart&apos;s one really good moment in the documentary sun in years with its endorsement of organic products. But whatever you&apos;re own persuasion on food- be you a hardcore vegan or someone just coming from McDonalds before the movie starts- Food, Inc can make some sort of difference, if only for the information. I know I may not stop eating certain foods, but I&apos;ll never forget to give another look or a double take on what&apos;s in it- or what may not be there at all. This movie is good, valuable stuff.",

Sure, Matthew McConaughey and Rene Russo gave convincing performances, but Pacino makes you feel sorry for the miserable, empty shell of a man he is.\n\nThe plot was amazingly intricate and well carried, but (once again) without Pacino it would not have been delivered nearly as well. I think that they should have found a way to include a small explanation as to how sports betting works, so the fans who came in just to see Pacino would be able to understand how it works. Also, at times the movie just dragged on and on and on...\n\nI still think that Al Pacino is that movie. Pacino really extends himself the way he always does to keep the movie alive and moving. His character was one of the most miserable men I have ever seen, and while i hated him, I still identified a small part of myself with him, and that is the sign of a truly great actor.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Behold the cinematic calamity that is Sikandar, a film that bravely attempts to cobble together a handful of semi-decent ideas before swan-diving into a cesspool of cringe and archaic South Indian tropes that even a time machine couldn&apos;t salvage. The narration limps along like a bored tortoise, while the screenplay tosses in a few tolerable scenes and lines before collapsing into a flat, dull, snooze-fest that could double as a cure for insomnia.\n\nSalman Khan graces the screen looking like he&apos;s about to get admited in a hospital,&quot; his acting is no better.\n\nKajal Agarwal in her limited and unimportant role appears to have traded her charm for a face full of fillers and Botox, rendering her a plastic caricature with the same old subpar performance we&apos;ve come to dread.\n\nRashmika, whose grating voice and overacting could make a saint weep, and you&apos;ve got a Salman-Rashmika duo so mismatched, it felt absurd and agonizing.\n\nSathyaraj&apos;s turn as the antagonist is about as convincing as a toddler in a trench coat pretending to be a mob boss, while the rest of the cast flails valiantly in this sinking ship. The production values are passable, like a participation trophy for effort, but the music is a forgettable dirge that fails to stir the soul. The direction? A relic of a bygone era, so outdated it might as well have been shot on a flip phone.\n\nIn short, Sikandar is a cinematic misadventure not worth the popcorn you&apos;d choke on while trying to endure it. Save your time, your money, and your sanity-skip this one."

Ok, I&apos;ll admit, the story is pretty odd, but it&apos;s still very good, and it&apos;s a great adventure.\n\nAll the actors do a great job in the film.  Elizabeth Shue looks as beautiful as ever and does a great job as Chris Parker.  Keith Coogan does a great job as well.  Other notable cast members are Vincent D&apos;Onofrio, Penelope Ann Miller, Geroge Newbern, Bradley Whitford, and Lolita Davidovich.  Also, I have to hand it to director Chris Columbus, he did a superb job with this film.  Amazingly enough, this was his first directorial effort too.  Good job Chris!  It&apos;s always good to see where directors come from, if you didn&apos;t know, he went on to do &quot;Home Alone&quot;, &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot;, and &quot;Harry Potter: The Sorcerer&apos;s Stone&quot;, just to name a few.\n\nThere are so many good things about this film!  This movie&apos;s got action, adventure, and comedy.  The comedy in the film is absolutely fantastic! There are a few scenes that crack me up just thinking about them.  ...And there are a great number of quotable lines that everyone that has seen this movie will remember.\n\nAnyhow, I strongly suggest you see this film!  I really hope that you enjoy the film if you haven&apos;t seen it already.  Thanks for reading,\n\n-Chris",

Because I happen to like this movie as a bit of fun popcorn fluff, but reading the posts and other reviews you&apos;d think some people were expecting a vampire genred &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. But, whatever. \n\nThe film is essentially a tongue in cheek vampire film with an action and role reversal twist. There&apos;s not much else here. We&apos;ve got some marquis players in the thing starting with Donald Sutherland as the world weary trainer, Rutger Hauer as the upper crusted monster from Slovak nobility, to TV&apos;s then very popular Luke Perry, the guy who plays a little role reversal with Kristy Swanson&apos;s character.\n\nIt&apos;s essentially boy meets girl meets vampires kind of film. It&apos;s a bit of a coming of age film where the main characters either evolve and learn to deal with the hardships of real life monsters, or wind up being certifiable.\n\nBeyond that it&apos;s just a fun film to watch. There&apos;s some adventure, some romance, a few laughs, some horror, and some action. Imagine the cheerleader you had a crush on in high school turning into Rambo for the paranormal. That&apos;s pretty much what Buffy&apos;s all about.\n\nPop it in to the old DVD player and enjoy!"

Now director &quot;Beat&quot; Takeshi  best known for Hana Bi  introduces Zatoichi to a new generation. Takeshi also stars as Zatoichi, the elderly masseur and dice gambler whose hearing is so acute he can detect which side a die has fallen. He&apos;s a master swordsman, too  one slice and you&apos;re diced.\n\nSupporting characters include two beautiful geishas avenging their parents&apos; death, a farmer and her drunkard nephew, the gangsters running the town and a masterless samurai (an impressive performance from Tadanobu Asano).\n\nThe Blind Swordsman is great fun, although it could do with a tighter structure. And I was shocked by the spectacular tap-dancing finale  in traditional Japanese dress and shoes! ***½/***** stars.",

Then the setting moves to the ground, and we see local law enforcement agency and the FBI getting involved, things gets dumb and dumber.\n\nWhy they had to abandon the airplane and go into the boring ground scene, I have no idea. They lost all the plot right there and then. The guy who escaped was absolute nobody, so it wasn&apos;t interesting even if he did escape. Movie gets worse as it progresses as even the fight scene including Wesley Snipes gets worse.\n\nThe stunt at the end was ridiculous. How can a police car catch up with a jet plane that&apos;s about to reach take off velocity ?\n\nThe fault was with the writer. The movie could have been 100% better if Wesley Snipes was allowed to sleuth around the airplane inflicting damages to the bad guys. Then it would have been a budget version of Die-hard, or maybe better, and the movie surely would have been a classic with sequels.\n\nToo bad that they blew their opportunity, because of poor script writing."

Way to many &quot;why did they do this&quot; questions, way to many overly long scenes, and quite possibly the worst use of hand held camera technology in recent memory. 2 or 3 scenes could have been cut by more then half and gotten twice the effect. The use of music became annoying. People were walking out claiming to be nauseous, have headaches, etc. Would love to see have seen one steady shot, one establishing shot, one non-closeup. With that said, was worth seeing just for the performance of Anne Hathaway who was a revelation and now catapults to the head of the class of the 20 something acting class. This emotional performance marks a turning point in her career and makes me want to revisit some of her past performances to see what was there.",

      "name": "Nothing &quot;Fine&quot; about this Nanny ...",
      "reviewBody": "Sorry for the lousy pun but a nanny-themed movie starring Madeline Zima was asking for it, now, let the review start. \n\nYou have a good typical American Family made of a handsome blue-eyed scientist with a sexy beard, played by an actor whose fame didn&apos;t rise much since the film, a frail devoted asthmatic housewife who looks like the twin sister of Talia Shire with a nicer hairdo, played by Annabella Sciorra, and a smart little girl (Zima), that&apos;s for the initial picture, and this happy family is looking for a nanny to take care of their newborn son and brother, so that Claire (the wife) can take care of a greenhouse project. Kind of a boring premise ... but there&apos;s more spicy elements about this family, and it&apos;s all wrapped up in the first 15 minutes, like a script school-case.\n\nDuring a visit, Claire was victim of sexual abuse from her gynecologist, she sued him, other mothers complained, he killed himself, his wife played by Rebecca De Mornay didn&apos;t inherit the money and what&apos;s more, she has a miscarriage in the process, and become permanently sterile. To call it a strike of &apos;bad luck&apos; would be the understatement of the millennium. Still, in her bad luck, while watching the news, she could catch the name and face of that woman who was indirectly responsible for all the personal mayhem she went through. You gotta wonder what the TV and police were thinking. Anyway, now, guess who&apos;s gonna offer his services for the nanny job?\n\nGood thriller always rely on simple concept. &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; is no exception, it was an unexpected hit in 1992, the same year of a similarly themed film &quot;Single White Female&quot;. Both are based on the same &quot;Stranger Within&quot; concept, when the lives of an ordinary family or group of persons are affected by the entrance of a next- door stranger, and it is a source of heart-pounding psychological thrills that was made started with &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; and &quot;Misery&quot;. The &quot;Stranger Within&quot; thriller is almost a synonym of &apos;fatal attraction&apos;... in fact, the film could have as a tag-line &quot;Fatal Attraction with a Nanny&quot;, just like &quot;Single White Female&quot; was &quot;Fatal Attraction with a Roommate&quot;.\n\nSo, there are reasons though why this film wasn&apos;t as memorable as the one with Glenn Close, the surprise effect asked for more tricks and it&apos;s likely that the ones used in the film never really catch the audience off guard. Rewatching the film myself after 15 years, I realized that the realism, as used in Curtis Hanson&apos;s film, was made of the self- canceling effect between things happening too conveniently well for the villainess for the first three quarters, and then for the good guys in the last one. The evolution of the narrative is so schematically well-oiled that even the greatest effects are still attenuated by their predictability. It wows at times but hardly with a major &apos;w&apos;.\n\nJust to give you an idea, my younger brother who has seen less movies than I (ten years younger) immediately guessed that the big black retarded guy (played by the only Ghostbuster whose name is hardly remembered) was gonna be the last-minute hero, needless to say that he harbored a triumphant smile when at the climax, the poor daddy broke his legs and was immediately disqualified from the final confrontation. Anyone could&apos;ve guess that but he also predicted that the slutty evil baby sitter would frame him so that he can be expelled from the house, and that was impressive.\n\nHe still enjoyed the film and I still did, but it is true that, suspension of disbelief was too demanding. So many things go totally wrong as soon as Peyton, the baby sitter makes her entrance that it&apos;s a wonder how Claire can&apos;t reassemble the pieces of he puzzle. She wants to wear a sexy dress, but she finds a last-minute stain and then puts the something that looks like extracted from the wall cover of a grandma&apos;s house. But let&apos;s say she&apos;s naive and at least, the character of the friend Marlene, played by sexy Julianne Moore never really trusted Peyton, but then how about a missing application letter, how about the sudden change of behavior of her daughter. But let&apos;s just say that, given how these tricks work, and how efficient they are in their frustrating effects, I accept them for the sake of what I expect from a B-movie thriller.\n\nStill, there are three things I can&apos;t really forgive and that could&apos;ve been easily avoided, Peyton could have faked a resume, after all the troubles that affected Claire&apos;s family, they would take some precautions and not let any stranger entering their world, just like that. Secondly, I don&apos;t think a woman who didn&apos;t have a child, much more sterile, can breast-feed a baby, and last but not least, the depiction of asthma. Not only these wheezing noises were annoying because they were never matching Clair&apos;s chests&apos; movements, but when you decide that your movie will have a main character suffering from asthma, is it too much asking some tutorial about the proper use of an inhaler. All she did was making a quick click, she never put the inhaler in her mouth and it didn&apos;t feel as if she was inhaling anything.\n\nIf you care for realism, the film might not be your cup of tea, but that&apos;s not a reason to dismiss it, &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, as a milestone as it was (and it wasn&apos;t) had its more-or- less ridiculously unrealistic parts. So, Hanson&apos;s film is enjoyable for what it serves well, a solid villainous performance, and an eerie sometimes sexy atmosphere that creates a well-packaged average psychological thriller, that&apos;s all, but as far as realism is concerned, well, it&apos;s not a good sign when a film is an inspiration for these hilarious &apos;100 THings I learned&quot; threads ...",

      "reviewBody": "How to make a comedy out of very tragic events and characters? Adrian Brody did it in &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; about life in a concentration camp. &quot;Look Who&apos;s Back&quot; does it via the premise that Adolf Hitler returns to modern day Germany. Of course everyone believes that he is an actor - one who disturbingly never steps out of character. The audience knows that he cannot - as he actually is Hitler. Much of the film is humorous as Hitler tries to reestablish himself as &quot;The Fuhrer&quot; and tries to understand and cope with modern day technology and attitudes.\n\nOliver Masucci is brilliant as Hitler -playing the role so straight that he became very scary near the end. The brilliance of Hitler was aptly demonstrated as people began responding to the hate - filled rhetoric he employed on various television shows. In real life the industrialists supported Hitler because they were sure they could control him - they could not. The church supported him because they thought he would be useful to them and that they could control him - they could not. Finally the German Army threw in with him because they wanted to get rid of their rivals - Hitler&apos;s &quot;brown shirt&quot; Army - the Sturmabteilung (SA). He got rid of Strasser and Rohm and thousands of others as he dismantled the organization which carried him to power. But alas the Army also could not control him.\n\nIn the movie, he becomes a media star because of viewership and ratings. We see glimpses of the audience saying like &quot;I think I agree with him, and he makes a lot of sense.&quot; The TV moguls are building their careers on his outrageousness and resulting popularity.\n\nHis grasp on people is creepy, insidious and feels quite realistic. This film shows you how riveting he could be - and gives you a glimpse into how he came to power. \n\nSo, beyond laughs - the message clearly is that this could happen again. We must be aware of potential dictators in our midst. A few people in the movie saw that he really was Hitler - and they were discarded at the end of the movie.\n\nThis movie is not a condemnation of Germany - past or present. Hitler in the movie postulates at the end of the film that we cannot get rid of him - because he is a part of us. I hope that is not true.",

Ellen Brody is now living in the Bahamas after her youngest son Sean, who has followed in the footsteps of his father and become Chief of the Amity police, is killed by another Great White Shark. In what is the most ridiculous plots of all time, we find out that one specific shark is holding a grudge against the Brody family, and after it kills Sean, it swims against the Gulf Stream down to the Bahamas so it can kill Ellen and Michael as well. Jaws: The Revenge is an embarrassment to anyone who knows anything about sharks, and is the worst of the series.\n\nThe plot is completely wrong in this movie. The whole plot is built off of bs. I can&apos;t even allow suspension of disbelief to let me ignore that the shark is hunting the Brody family. It&apos;s ridiculous! Aside from that is that the film contains any number of factual errors about sharks ranging from having the shark swim backwards, roar like a lion, stand on its tail, and devour a helicopter. The shark in the first film did unusual things, but nothing that would make a shark lover cry.\n\nThe acting in this movie is so bad that...You know what? I don&apos;t even want to discuss it. It&apos;s bad. Terrible. Loathsome. Repugnant. What else is there? Lorraine Gray played Ellen just fine in the first film, but for some reason in this film she let all of her acting skill slip away. Even Michael Caine, who is a vastly talented actor, shows absolutely no skill at all.\n\nEvery copy of Jaws: The Revenge should be swallowed by the shark from the first film.\n\n1/10",

      "reviewBody": "As it has already been said by the critics a millions of times that SRK is back in form with his latest double role extravaganza, Fan is truly a grandiloquent comeback of the King of Bollywood after nearly half a dozen misses where he hardly reached the niche he had earlier crafted for himself.It is like a subversion from his previous self ,so much wooed by the lure of the business mathematics like Rs.200-300 Crores what some of the buffoonish movies of Bollywood earlier had made.But it seems the King soulfully listened to the prayers of the millions of his true &apos;Jabra&apos;(Insane) fans.More importantly, he did actually pay heed to his inner self ,as Aryan Khanna would often advise to Gourav Chandna in the movie itself.And the outcome of this realization is a subtle, metaphorical and at times philosophical movie like &apos;Fan&apos;.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that it will mint money like a Dabaang , a Happy New Year , a Chennai Express or even the pathetic Dhoom 3.But be rest assured that this reborn SRK has unleashed an unfathomable yet ingenious desire to strike the right chords in the right audience&apos;s heart.The extremities of the adulation of a fan for a megastar construct the periphery of this movie.Literally the periphery, as Mr.Khan in the dual role of Aryan Khanna and the love me-hate me- what to do to me Gourav Chandna holds the center-stage of this adrenaline rising sleek flick.A few scenes of the movie deserve to be remembered ever for the sheer brilliance of the actor who finally transcended the limits of being tipped,mocked and very often thrashed by the intellectuals as just a money monger with his obvious aspirations in his previous outings.The scene at the Delight hotel, Room No 205, the one where Aryan Khanna actually copies Gourav for his redemption or the climax scene where Aryan&apos;s eyes search for Gourav and Gourav&apos;s mirage makes him somber and self introspective- all offer you in bounty to adore and take a bow for Mr.khan&apos;s acting brilliance even if you are not his fan.The chase scenes are all Hollywoodesque barring the first one where you can easily find the VFX lacunae. The supporting actors are perfect in their minuscule roles.But once you are into the movie, you will gradually realize that the fallen king of Bollywood had chosen this as his vehicle to make his rejected and dejected fans believe what an arsenal of talent he still is.This movie like what I said for Swades or Chak De India as well upon their respective releases, would be a hallmark for the illustrious career of SRK and even if it fails to be a humongous hit, it will ever be remembered as a a benchmark of what skilled perfection of acting can do to otherwise an average movie.In the history of Hindi movie, it will be always remembered with the same respect what films like &apos;Taxi Driver&apos;,&apos;Vertigo&apos; or &apos;Scarface&apos; earned in Hollywood.Arguably the best movie of King Khan&apos;s career as an actor, this layered movie interwoven with myriads of subtleties is going to stay in your heart even when he broke the norms of being a mandolin playing or arms stretched hero in an exotic location to stay in the rat race of actors.By the way, did I forget to tell that this 144 minutes movie does not have a song and the lovable &apos;jabra&apos; tune was only for promotion? Go watch it and do yourself a favor.\n\nP.S: If I take a break from being a critic and tell what my heart not my brain asks me to do, I would always say that I loved the second half more... If there is one movie made in Bollywood you aspire to watch before you die just for sheer acting brilliance Hamin Asto, Hamin Asto,Hamin Asto...",

      "reviewBody": "As I write this, I&apos;m really struggling to evaluate whether the latest film of Ben Wheatley (&quot;High Rise&quot;) is a masterpiece or just pulp trash. It&apos;s certainly a brave and highly distinctive venture, with that you can&apos;t argue.\n\nSet in Boston in 1978, an arms deal is going down in a deserted warehouse. Brokered by Justine (Brie Larson, &quot;Room&quot;) an IRA team headed by Frank (Michael Smiley, &quot;The World&apos;s End&quot;) with his business guy Chris (Cillian Murphy, &quot;Inception&quot;, &quot;Batman Begins&quot;) are on the buying side. As &apos;roadies&apos; they&apos;ve brought with them a couple of crack- head friends Stevo (Sam Riley, &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;, &quot;Maleficent&quot;) and Bernie (Enzo Cilenti, &quot;The Martian&quot;) who are far from stable.\n\nOn the selling side is South African dealer and &quot;international a-hole&quot; Vern (Sharlto Copley, &quot;Elysium&quot;), his suave and wisecracking protector Ord (Arnie Hammer, &quot;The Man From Uncle&quot;) and Vern&apos;s right hand man Martin (Babou Ceesay, &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;). What connects all of these individuals is that no-one likes or trusts anyone else.\n\nUnfortunately, one of Vern&apos;s van drivers is John Denver-lover Harry (the excellent Jack Treynor, &quot;Sing Street&quot;) who has very recent personal history with Stevo. The fuse is lit, and when the two meet chaos ensues: in the words of Anchorman&apos;s Ron Burgundy, &quot;That escalated quickly&quot;!\n\nAnd, for a 90 minute film, that&apos;s basically it. If you think after viewing the trailer &quot;there must be more to the film than this&quot;.... you&apos;re wrong!\n\nHowever, what there is of it is enormously entertaining. Played ostensibly for laughs, with very very black humour and an F-word and a gunshot in every other sentence, some of the characters – notably those played by Sharlto Copley, Armie Hammer and Brie Larson – have some hilarious dialogue. The star turn for me though was Jack Treynor who was just so impressive as the &apos;lost at sea&apos; brother in the delightful &quot;Sing Street&quot; and here delivers a stand-out performance as another brother on a mission... this time a mission of vengeance. You are waiting throughout the film for the inevitable showdown between Harry and Stevo - - and when it comes it is both bloody and memorable.\n\nA cracking 70&apos; soundtrack, put together by the Portishead duo of Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury, involves 70&apos;s classics by Credence Clearwater Revival, John Denver and The Real Kids and it&apos;s hammered out at top volume over the action. The downside of this effect is that - for my old ears at least - it sometimes make some of the dialogue hard to follow.\n\nAs a policing exercise, the film clearly has merit. In the same manner as Schwarzenegger&apos;s &quot;Running Man&quot; put criminals in an arena to cull them, so this must have reduced the crime rates in both Boston and Belfast no end! While some may not approve of the levels of violence on show, it is all done in a highly cartoonish way: like a &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon, or &quot;Home Alone&quot;, everyone seems to get shot multiple times and yet (in the main) is still active and mobile. All of this makes criticism of the performances something of a waste of time, but I would comment that some of the acting is of the &quot;over the top&quot; variety: surprisingly, I found some of Oscar winner Brie Larson&apos;s scenes falling into this category and snapping me out of the narrative at times.\n\nBut overall, my evaluation is now done and I am rooting on the side of it being a brash and exhilarating minor masterpiece. Yes, it&apos;s one- dimensional. Yes, it is virtually impossible to feel any empathy with any of the characters, as they are all universally loathsome. But it&apos;s a movie whose flaws are forgivable based on the characterisation and the cracking good script by long-term collaborators Ben Wheatley and Amy Jump.\n\nTight as it is within its 90 minute running time, I doubt you will be bored.\n\n(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com.

      "reviewBody": "It saddens me to watch The Cove, because unless your heart is made of stone, it&apos;s unlikely not to become unaffected by it, when it shows how evil man can be. It also boggles the mind when you mull over whether the perpetrators know exactly what they&apos;re doing in committing such atrocities, that extinction of species boil down to those who are indifferent, inhumane, and corrupted by the smell of profits that highlights Man&apos;s propensity for destruction. To claim superiority over another by explanation of the preservation of culture, is bullshit at best, and it just shows how consciously ignorant we can sometimes get due to either lack of understanding, or just simply refusing to change incorrect mindsets.\n\nI&apos;m sure many of us will agree that dolphins are very beautiful water-based mammals, and the lucky few who have gotten to chance upon them in their natural habitat will attest to the fact that it&apos;s awe-inspiring to have seen them in action. From time to time we read about the heroic nature of our mammal counterparts in saving human lives, so what would warrant such untold cruelties toward those blessed by Nature with a smile and an extremely gentle, docile nature, or cursed as the filmmakers would say, because they are unable to project outwardly their feelings of pain, sadness and betrayal by humankind?\n\nDirector Louie Psihoyos had crafted an incredible documentary which isn&apos;t just another save- this-species film, or just another wildlife conservation flick. Somehow, The Cove stands above those that I&apos;ve seen which have run along those lines, in that it contains footages that the team had managed to wrangle out in a quest for the truth. It contains scenes of murder most foul, which will start again in the month of September, unless people around the world make some noise beyond puppet worldwide organizations fueled by corrupt bureaucrats bent on smug thinking that half-baked nonsensical answers can keep the truth under wraps.\n\nWhat also added that emotional weight to the film, is the inclusion of Richard O&apos;Barry, who could be infamously credited with sparking the interest in dolphin-aquariums and shows around the world, simply because of his involvement in the Flipper television series, where he had responsibility in capturing and training 5 dolphins used for that successful series, and henceforth spawned an industry of sorts where dolphins are captured en masse by confusing them and leading them into man-made traps, then allowing trainers around the world to come and choose those with potential. Think of it like the slave trade which we have abhorred, but now transferred to the animal kingdom, with a murderous act of slaughtering thousands of those which don&apos;t make the theme-park cut. Who are we to decide those that cannot entertain, only deserves to be chopped up in cold blood for the supermarkets?\n\nO&apos;Barry is now an activist set on releasing every dolphin in captivity, but only because of a personal, profound loss of a dolphin in his arms that have jolted him into action. He&apos;s quite forthright in his interviews, and his transformation as explained is nothing less than heart- wrenching. His crusade led him to Taiji, Japan, which is the source of the trade, with over- zealous Japanese fishermen bordering on counter-surveillance, muscling in on local police influence, to try and keep O&apos;Barry at bay from interrupting their profitable trade, and of course putting a dampener on O&apos;Barry&apos;s search for redemption.\n\nMost of the film then centered on the filmmakers and their assembling of a few good men and women with specific skill sets, such as free-diving and prop-making, acoustics experts to covert camera operations, in an attempt to expose the truth from The Cove, an area designed by natural geography and exploited by the fishermen to perform their most heinous acts. It&apos;s akin to a heist movie with intense preparation work and danger lurking around every corner, but the images obtained are nothing less than shocking – the indiscriminate slaughter without remorse and plenty of laughter, a very affecting sea waters filled with red from the bloodbath, and frenetic cries for help and unsuccessful flight from death. It&apos;ll make the most stoic of men, shed tears.\n\nThe film also had touched upon another aspect of how Man is offending Nature through our polluting ways, but Psihoyos deftly included that portion in because it&apos;s also related, but never letting it detract its focus from the main story. While dolphin meat doesn&apos;t appeal, being slyly packaged as something else is nothing less than cheating. Also, the high levels of mercury found in the meat not only endangers whoever is putting it on their dinner plate, but just emphasizes the entire polluted food chain with the fact that we are the #1 pollutants on this planet, and poisoning of marine life, or rapid consumption of food from the sea, is something that will impact us in time to come very soon, unless we wake up.\n\nOne of the world&apos;s most intelligent creatures getting slaughtered indiscriminately, and you can do something about it. Undoubtedly as a film this is very well made, and have received countless of accolades, but if audiences were to stop at this point then nothing will change and everything will be lost, starting from the efforts from the activists. This film is set to break into my top films of the year as well, but even that rings hollow.\n\nWhat we can do, at the very least, is to vote with our wallet. Make some noise, talk about it, spread the word and get people go watch the film, and take affirmative action. With demand and attendances to sea-world-like or dolphin theme parks come crashing down because we choose not to patronize them, then demand for dolphins to perform at these locations will no longer be viable.",

He nails the Boston accent, and also shows the anger and frustration of the rehabilitation journey, along with how he reconciles with his ex girlfriend. Gyllenhaal not only is a phenomenal actor here, but his comedy shines through too. He does has chemistry with actress Tatiana Maslany.\n\nMy big issue is that the characters who portray Jeff&apos;s family are all stooges, and they are just loud and unhelpful throughout. Jeff&apos;s mom especially is a piece of work and a lot of her one liners are crass. The one credible side character was Jeff&apos;s Costco manager, who doesn&apos;t have much screen time.\n\nI think what would have made the movie better is showing more of Jeff&apos;s anxiety of becoming a father, how he returned back to work, and how he came to terms with PTSD. While this biopic did cover a lot of ground, i admit it was repetitious and uninspiring.\n\nThis flopped at the box office, so take your pick. I think it&apos;s worth watching this just to see Gyllenhaal&apos;s acting range.",

      "reviewBody": "Some publications gave Gomorra a perfect rating, while others gave more basic reviews but, in a week where The Times reviewed about 10 new releases and gave this 5 stars and everything else 1 or 2, I decided this was a film I should check out and that The House Bunny could perhaps wait for another time (specifically, when it is the last film on Earth). Gomorra opens with a beauty salon hit which I imagine is meant to introduce us to the violent and treacherous world of the Cammora crime syndicate in the locality of Naples, Italy. As an impacting opening, it does work but the &quot;introduction&quot; idea is sadly where the film is roundly weak and it does mean that it has the potential to confuse.\n\nBefore I get a barrage of messages pointing out to me that cousins shouldn&apos;t marry, I do not mean that I could not follow the specific threads of the film but just that the film offers nothing to inform the new viewer of the world that we are about to enter. I&apos;m not sure the best of doing this but certainly at first I didn&apos;t totally appreciate the scale of the organisation, the structure or the setting and it took me a minute as a result to get into the stories. Unlike similar films, the separate threads never really come together in any way other than they share a grounding in location and the problem of the Cammora. Outside of a specific introduction for those coming in cold, the film does give a sort of introduction to the problem as we first follow one of the characters around the nightmarish, enclosed estate of flats which seems to perform the task of judge and prison-officer as those born into it have little opportunity to escape it and essentially have their fate sealed by virtue of their environment. \n\nWithin this feat of architecture we follow several threads including a money-man, a boy getting into the life on the lowest rung, a man starting out in the corrupt world of waste management, a black-market tailor looking to earn a bit more on the side and two young men who decide to seize power in their region from the old, fat men who sit at the top. In terms of engagement, there isn&apos;t really a huge emotional draw within the film but instead it all feels very realistic and dead - so it is not so much that you feel for the specific characters so much as you have a constant sense of hopelessness and of how small and petty it all it. This is not the Italian gangsterisms of The Godfather where there is a certain sense of class and aspiration, in Gomorra the top men are trapped in the world the same as everyone else - with more money perhaps but they are not living in mansions or controlling things from a tropical island. The delivery of the film helps this as it is well shot on location and has a hand-held feel of grit and dirt. I didn&apos;t really like the technique employed throughout where the focus was on the subject in the close foreground and everything else was blurred, even as it came into play in the scene but otherwise it was well done, with the sudden moments of violence made more impacting by not being seen due to confusion simulated in the camera or by quick editing.\n\nGomorra has been compared to City of God, Goodfellas and all the other crime films that get wheeled out for reviews. In most ways this is not really a fair description because Gomorra does not have the style and flair of those films, nor do all the narrative threads come together neatly in the way we have come to expect. However it is still an engagingly bleak and realistic look into the world of the Cammora that is well done even if it has flaws. It is not &quot;enjoyable&quot; per se due to the lack of flair, but it is a very good film nonetheless and, like City of God did with City of Men, it offers the potential for a mini-series to further explore and find stories from within this world."

      "reviewBody": "Daniel Radcliffe as a FBI agent and an extreme white supremacist, now that was a film I really had to see. Personally, I love undercover stories as they have inbuilt elements of excitement and uncertainty. You&apos;re wondering constantly whether the covert operation is going to be a success or a failure. \n\nEven with a shaved head and gangster clothes, Radcliffe lacked menace, fury and vitriol one might expect from a white supremacist. His eyes emanate a childlike innocence that is difficult to overcome even by vulgar behaviour and foul language. He doesn&apos;t astound, but I was quite engrossed in his performance. I cared about him and I wanted him to succeed. \n\nI would have loved to see a deeper examination of infiltration strategies than what was in this film. It employs tips from the well – known book: Dale Carnegie&apos;s &apos;How to win friends and influence people&apos;, and doesn&apos;t go beyond that. By being as simple as it is, it takes away the intrigue of an undercover story. \n\nThere were some nail-biting scenes and clever dialogue that held my attention. We do get to delve into the mindsets of several white supremacists. The finale, however, felt very rushed. It came across as very sudden and I questioned its plausibility. It seems that the writers just needed a quick and thrilling end to the story without considering whether it is consistent with what they have developed earlier, both story and character wise. \n\nI admire Radcliffe&apos;s tenacity to take on such a role. Even though the film wasn&apos;t a profound artwork, he does well in trying to break the seemingly immutable image of him as Harry Potter. Anyone who is used to seeing him as the boy who lived would be pleasantly surprised.",

It&apos;s better than the first one, extracts more laughs and punches and the characters have a more humane temperament that explores the other side of &apos;bhaigiri&apos;. The plot is truly the winning card of the movie, not to discount the effective casting, dialogues that are a mix of funny and introspective, a rib-tickling screenplay, enjoyable situational songs and a first rate direction. Sanjay Dutt as Munna Bhai and Arshad Warsi as Circuit wear their characters as their second skins, more comfortably, more snuggly and are more lovable than their avatars in the earlier Munna Bhai MBBS. Ditto for Boman Irani who dons the role of Lucky Singh, a sardarji builder; a meanie with a heart. Vidya Balan also puts her best foot forward as a radio jockey who makes Dutt&apos;s heart goes hmmm... Dia Mirza and Jimmy Shergill justify their cameo appearances. A surprise element during the climax is a thoughtful addition and cheers the audience, specially the female audience threefold. Though the film is not a sequel to Munna Bhai MBBS, Lage Raho Munna Bhai retains the characters of Munna and Circuit in the lead roles and their nontoxic, almost childlike idiosyncrasies. This idea also gives an unlimited scope for possibilities the hit pair of Munna and Circuit can indulge into in future. Lage Raho Munna Bhai is a story about Murli Prasad Sharma aka Munna who meets Mahatma Gandhi and undergoes a heart transformation. For Munna, breaking bones and abducting people at the snap of his fingers was easier than the courage it required to walk on the path of non-violence and truth. Hesitatingly and unwittingly he takes the road less traveled, which is thorny and full of obstacles in return for self revelation and a guilt-free conscience that fears nothing and no-one. The &apos;Gandhivad&apos; is turned into &apos;Gandhigiri&apos; by self proclaimed Professor Murli Prasad Sharma for its practical implementation in the present day, without sounding preachy or heavy-duty. There is a similar &apos;offering the other cheek&apos; when someone slaps you, confessions of truth and also the &apos;satyagrah&apos; for a bunch of old people who lose their house called &apos;Second Innings&apos; to the manipulative and greedy Lucky Singh. Sad but true that our nation won freedom but lost its people, Murli tries to revive faith, courage, truth and justice in people from different walks of life. With his new found ideology or the chemical &apos;locha&apos; in his brain, he triumphs over the cynics or the lost souls and also wins the love of his life. An interesting observation can be made between Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra&apos;s &apos;Rang De Basanti&apos; and Rajkumar Hirani&apos;s &apos;Lage Raho Munna Bhai&apos;, the fact that though the theme of both films is more or less the same, the approach to resolving the conflict is in complete contrast with each other, like two ends of the same thread. Yet both films succeed in their own unique ways and deliberate the depths of human emotions and reflections in an identical manner. In the end, hats off to Vidhu Vinod Chopra for producing a film that is a wholesome entertainer and succeeds in giving a heartfelt message in the times where films are made merely to fulfill the whims and fancies of egoistic filmmakers.\n\n-Nidhi Kathuria",

The story is thin, the acting is average at most, the dialogs are embarrassing dumb. Even the special effects are not up to date. In one scene the CGI characters even judder ! The only nice thing are Claire Forlani, Kristanna Loken and Eva Padberg (although only one short scene) - but only because of their visual appearance. Leelee Sobieski is disappointing stiff. Jason Stratham is a good actor for action movies, but fiction movies have a story, too. Burt Reynolds - I don&apos;t know, why he did it. John Rhys-Davies a veteran to this genre - helpless. Ray Liotta - suffers from bad directing.",

Especially when its done as well as this. It&apos;s also scarier than the ring in terms of jump-out- of-the-seat moments, though it doesn&apos;t have any scenes quite on a par with the ring&apos;s freaky crawl out the telly scene, but then that&apos;s probably the best horror scene ever so I can forgive it for that! As well as the scares you&apos;ve got good acting, good well structured plot and a really great ending - I didn&apos;t see it coming at all.\n\nIn conclusion, if you liked the ring you will love this. 9/10",

Having watched it several times over the years, I consider it to be a tragedy with a bleak atmosphere of building dread, all leading to a horrific finale. This is a tale of love, loss, and the maddening effects of the unknown.\n\nYoung couple, Rex Hofman (Gene Bervoets) and Saskia Wagter (Johanna ter Steege) are on a holiday trip, when Saskia goes missing. Thus begins a three year ordeal for Rex, who, in addition to being shattered by the incident, is also obsessed with solving the mystery of Saskia&apos;s disappearance. His entire life is geared toward finding out what happened to her, to the exclusion of all else.\n\nEnter Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), who is shown as the prime suspect from the very beginning. Rex and Raymond are on a fateful collision course, driven by each man&apos;s desire to &quot;know&quot;.\n\nMuch foreshadowing at the start of the film -including Saskia&apos;s revealing of her greatest fear, a symbolic dream, and the couple&apos;s almost ritualistic use of a pair of coins- make what follows as mystical as it is heartbreaking.\n\nAlong the way, we also learn much about the character of Lemorne, making him a far more nuanced villain than in most such works. While we may not be able to relate to his motives, we do gain understanding of why he does what he does. In the end, we feel the results of his actions.\n\nSPOORLOOS is a masterpiece of darkness and sorrow..."

I was impressed by the quality of the scenes, the location and the chosen frames were good (and effective, because it was scary). I also liked how the actors played their role. The connection between the sisters was well presented and the husband played quite well the role of a very rational man.\n\nThe story, however, was a little bit predictable. By the end of the first half of the movie I already assumed who the murderer was and what was going to happen next.\n\nIt is a pretty good movie to watch. :)",

It&apos;s more about the characters and how they react to certain situations.\n\nQuite a few people were appalled by the fact, that there is not that much happening in the movie, but I liked it, because it was slow moving, because it took it&apos;s sweet time. Another criticism is that the movie is predictable. Again it&apos;s not so much about where it&apos;s going, but how it gets there (the &quot;road&quot; so to speak, even literally in this case).",

My 8 yr. old Son, however, got his own idea from the trailers, and wondered how a &quot;review&quot; could possibly say it was &quot;no good&quot; as I had reported. So I took he and his 10 yr. old buddy to the matinée.\n\nI&apos;ll admit there were a couple of wordy moments where the illusion was broken for me, but on the whole, with the involving 3-D effects, there were enough chuckles and action to leave me wondering why it was trashed. I&apos;ve seen much worse. I liked it better than Alvin &amp; the Chipmunks, and Up... but I think Monsters VS Aliens was more re-watchable.\n\nAs we left the chilly theater to enter the hot afternoon, I asked the boys what they thought. &quot;It was awesome!&quot; Well, not my exact thoughts but it wasn&apos;t a bad distraction from more serious current affairs.",

Bodycount of the villians wasted one by one, that&apos;s the main interest for this kind of film. And of course in the end, you have to obtain the exact count. If not, let&apos;s admit it is a bit boring. I have seen action flicks where the more the bad guys are killed, the more you have bad guys!!!! Yes, a good action film, worth seeing, despite it is of course lousy, forgettable."

      "reviewBody": "A subject like this requires attention and scrupulousness and it definitely had plenty of both. Based on the book &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot; written by David-Lindsay Abaire, the movie is riveting as far as execution and concept. It&apos;s very well organized, it&apos;s narrative structure is impressive and it definitely catches you emotionally. The story is about a family, husband (Aaron Eckhart) and wife (Nicole Kidman), that have to deal with the emotional consequences of losing their 4 years old child. In order to free themselves they have to accept the past and move on and also to regain their trust in themselves and recommit to their marriage. The movie is getting real honest approaching the human&apos;s allowance to forgiveness when the confrontation between the &quot;broken&quot; family and the one responsible for that finally has place. It might appear to be a simple story but it&apos;s not thanks to the patience and passion the director, John Cameron Mitchell, invested in it. Dazzling visually and very inspiring, this movie succeeds to entertain, amaze and replenish it&apos;s audience with hope in totality.\n\nCarried not only by it&apos;s execution but also by it&apos;s memorable Oscar-worthy performances, Rabbit Hole finds himself to be one of the best movies of 2010. Nicole Kidman as the simple Becca, offers one of her best performances in a long time. It&apos;s a simply astounding, honest and passionate performance of this weakened but reasonable and powerful woman that must be rewarded by the Academy with at least a nomination if not the award itself. Aaron Eckart does not get over-shadowed by Kidman&apos;s performance and proves once again that by portraying Becca&apos;s husband, Howie, his acting capabilities exceed our expectations. There are also notable performances by Dianne Wiest as Becca&apos;s mother and Miles Teller as the one responsible for the suffered loss.\n\nVisually the movie finds it&apos;s own identity in the beautiful palette of colors. The cinematography it&apos;s the most you could ask for this kind of movie. There&apos;s no need for any other requirements. The most beautiful thing though it&apos;s the soundtrack which as simple as it might be... it fits the atmosphere and the story perfectly. Those violin and guitar chords, the little piano rolling in the background create a unique peaceful mood.\n\nWhat I do want at the end of my review is to recommend this movie to anyone because it&apos;s simple but stunning, it&apos;s usual but complex, carried by three overwhelming performances. This is without a doubt one of the best movies released this year.",

      "reviewBody": "Straightforward film thad had been previously adapted in similar style , dealing with the famous kidnap and trial of the notorious Nazi officer. After WWII , a lot of essential figures in Hitler&apos;s command escaped Germany and were rumored to be living in South America as the nicknamed the Angel of Death : Joseph Mengele . And Adolph Eichmann wanted in connection with milions of deaths is suspected to be living incognito in Argentina and being main responsible of the &quot;Death Trains&quot; . Although in the movie Adolph Eichmann is nicknamed the Architect of the Final Solution, the real mastermind was Reinhard Heydrich who was the true promoter of the Conference of Wanshee where was dedided the Jews extermination and there Eichmann was actually an underling.\n\nThis is a tense and thrilling reenactment of the capture of Eichmann , posing as Richard Klement . The best scenes are when happen the twisted interrogation to Eichmann very well performed by Ben Kingsley . Main and support cast are frankly fine. Oscar Isaac is pretty good, giving a nice acting as the head of the team , determinated to bring the monster to the Israeli Justice . At the same time it deals with the Mossad : Israel Secret Intelligence Organitation under secret orders of Ben Gurion that will stop at nothing and at whatever cost to detain Adolph Eichman and bring him to Israeli justice.\n\n This one has been adapted too : The House on Garibaldi Street 1979 by Peter Collinson with Martin Balsam , Nick Mancuso, Charles Gray , Leo McKern .The Man who captured to Eichmann 1996 by William A Graham with Robert Duvall , Arliss Howard , Jeffrey Tambor .

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Fair Game&quot; is a film directed by Doug Liman (&quot;The Bourne Identity,&quot; &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&quot;) based on the memoir &quot;Fair Game: My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House&quot; by Valerie Plame. Sean Penn is back after taking a two-year acting break since his second Best Acting Oscar for &quot;Milk&quot; in 2008. He plays the character of Politician Joe Wilson alongside Naomi Watts&apos; portrayal of CIA agent Valerie Plame. Together these two tell the true story behind the weapons of mass destruction scare in 2002 and 2003 in Iraq that ultimately lead the United States to war. Valerie Plame is in the middle of the investigation of WMDs in Iraq. In order to learn more about the possible WMDs the government has Valerie&apos;s husband Joe travel as an ambassador to Niger in order to get information about the sale of uranium from Niger to Iraq. Joe learns that there is not going to be a sale but the government twists the story. After viewing the State of the Union Address Joe Wilson decides to write an article in the New York Times stating the truth behind what he found in Niger challenging the White House directly. In response, the government declassifies Valerie&apos;s status as a CIA agent making her &quot;Fair Game&quot; and putting her directly in the public eye in order to bring shame to her husband and her family. This sparks a fire within Joe to fight the White House, but also begins to tear him and his wife apart. \n\n&quot;Fair Game&quot; allows Naomi Watts and Sean Penn to let loose and take over the screen with their acting talents. Watts doe a very good job with her role portrayal of hard shelled Valerie Plame. She is able to create the stubborn exterior of Plame while showing her emotional side deep within. Congratulations is in order for her being able to stand out while on screen with Hollywood superstar and Academy favorite Sean Penn. All of the talk about the film has been directed towards Watts as Oscar season approaches, but it would be no surprise if Penn receives an Oscar birth as well. He is phenomenal in the film creating a very unique character breaking through the clichés that could have been. Both of these actors are able to give the film heart and show the strength that the couple had in order to fight the corrupt government sector leading to the fall of Scooter Libby.\n\nThe film is slow to start as the back story is built however, while the characters of Valerie Plame and Joe Wilson are developed completely all of the other characters seem to be left behind. They come off as just walking through the motions making it very hard to connect and differentiate between them. This can be attributed to one of two things. Either the acting is less than adequate, or there are so many characters that Watts interacts with at the CIA it are hard to put a name with any of the faces. \n\n&quot;Fair Game&quot; is a political thriller that needed to be made. However, it is your job as the audience to reach out and see it because of its limited film release. Go see it now in order to learn about the story and note that a Best Picture Oscar nomination may be waiting for this dark horse of this year&apos;s award season.",

      "reviewBody": "I loved the Peanuts half hour TV specials as a kid, particularly Halloween and Christmas. I make my kids watch them each year and they enjoy them. We have also watched at least one fuller length movie made some time ago (about a spelling bee?) that ran a little too long. Before the specials even existed I loved the Peanuts comic strips. This movie handled the characters great, no complaint there. I just got part way through and said okay where are we going with this and how much is left. So maybe the bottom line is Peanuts is more effective in small doses than in a full length movie. They seemed to realize that in having a short movie to start and keeping the running time down. Of the story lines the best (and the one that could be enjoyed the longest) was the Snoopy WWI theme. But the bottom line is that it may be hard to make this work for an hour or more no matter how you do it, even if you have stupendous graphics. In any event, nice to see a new generation of Schulz&apos;s carrying the torch.\n\nP.S. In watching some of the older shows recently, I remembered that the best of the TV shows was where they basically just strung a bunch of the daily cartoons together, rather than tell a traditional story. Charles Schulz was a cartoon genius, and had a penchant for running a series of consecutive strips on the same subject, sort of a continual story with a daily punch line, which is directly transferable to the screen. Maybe they could go back to that format next time around?",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is simply great at its time. Some people would say that this is childish kinda movie or copy of some Hollywood movie so for them please stop talking craps. Who are you to judge someone ? These kinda people only talk bull shits and can&apos;t appreciate a movie of their own origin. If you don&apos;t like Bollywood movie simply don&apos;t watch them but don&apos;t give idiotic reviews to divert people&apos;s mind.\n\nNow coming back to the movie. It&apos;s a must watch as I said and one of the terms if you really like acting to be true because Aamir acting is superb in both either playing of Samir or his doppelgänger and he has given you a very good movie which will never be remembered for long. And he always give you a WOW moment in his movie when you will leave everything and be shocked with a OMG and smile on your face. He has done a great acting and there are some scenes which is more than enough to digest like of ABs auto rickshaw scene and a time when Aamir ride the bike on a rope but apart from that the movie is full of woohoo and wow and fun and entertainment and action. And is definitely a masala entertainer and seriously Aamir will never let their fans down by choosing any stupid movie for acting. He is true genius in his work and always will be . Love you Aamir and your work for this Industry.\n\nI was about to hive 8 for the movie but I would give one extra mark for Aamir. 9/10 definitely nothing less than this would be injustice.",

      "reviewBody": "Interesting. Intense. Somewhat original. All words to describe a conversation with Johnny Betts. But they also apply to Michael Keaton&apos;s White Noise. What we have here is a ghost story that tackles the subject of electronic voice phenomenon, or, as the cool kids like to call it - EVP.\n\nFor those of you who, unlike Johnny Betts, aren&apos;t master ghost hunters, EVP is the alleged communication by spirits through the white noise of staticky radio stations, television stations, and other electronic devices. People truly believe in it, and if you do a quick search on the Internet then you can find plenty of websites with audio files they say prove the existence of EVP. Detractors will brush this off with explanations of the &quot;chaos theory&quot; and cross modulation. I&apos;ll let you do your own research if you&apos;re interested in the subject.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for a factual exploration of EVP&apos;s possible legitimacy, then you won&apos;t find it in White Noise. This is a movie that takes a subject popular with ghost hunters and glorifies it. It reminds me a little of The Mothman Prophecies, which was a fictionalized account of what was supposed to be a &quot;true story.&quot; I have no problem with that. That&apos;s what movies are all about.\n\nMichael Keaton crawls out from underneath whatever rock he&apos;s been under, does his best &quot;Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense&quot; impersonation, and dives into the world of receiving messages from the dead. Folks, you can nitpick the logic to death if you want, and trust me, most critics are. &quot;Why would he just put his successful life on hold and spend all his time trying to receive messages from his wife through a bunch of radio and TV static?&quot; Dunno. The tragic death of a spouse can do weird things to people. Plus, you know, IT&apos;S A MOVIE! And in the movie, he actually does receive messages from the dead. I guess he figured he&apos;d try it; it worked, so he got more involved. Lighten up. It&apos;s called fiction.\n\n&quot;Yeah, well, if his wife wanted to contact him, then why wouldn&apos;t she send him clearer messages? Why does it have to be through static?&quot; BECAUSE THAT&apos;S WHAT EVP IS ALL ABOUT! Take it up with the proponents of EVP, not the movie. I totally agree that one of the things that makes so many people skeptical about EVP is that the messages are never complex. If I heard an EVP that said, &quot;Tell Johnny Betts that the afterlife rules, and he should keep the Movie Mark going strong,&quot; then I&apos;d probably be convinced. But what we get is a lot of one syllable words and sounds strung together. That&apos;s not the movie&apos;s fault. Deal with it and move on.\n\nAs some of you know, I&apos;m a huge fan of the thriller/horror genre. Admittedly, White Noise isn&apos;t one of the best of all time in the genre, but that&apos;s OK. It didn&apos;t convince me to run home, record a static TV channel for hours, and then play it back to see if Uncle Jack was sending me a message from the great beyond. Like an apology for that little streaking stunt that completely ruined my 16th birthday party. However, what the movie did do is entertain me. The mystery is deliberately paced, it kept my interest, and it provided some creepy moments along the way.\n\nThings start to get pretty intense near the end of the movie, and some people might not be happy with the finale. But keep in mind that trying to communicate with the dead is a bit of a dark subject. Some people, as the movie depicts, think that if they can contact their dead relatives then they&apos;ll have hope, they&apos;ll know all is right in the afterlife. They want some sort of message for closure. But I&apos;m just curious, what if that message is, &quot;Burning. Hell. I screwed up.&quot; ??? I&apos;m guessing that&apos;d be a bit of a kick in the pants.\n\nBut getting back to the movie... if there&apos;s good in the afterlife, there has to be evil as well, right? In the movie, contacting the dead initially seems harmless enough. But why would you think only the good would respond if you create that human/afterlife portal? What would happen if evil decided to communicate as well? White Noise has a viewpoint on that subject, and you can&apos;t expect everything to be cute and cuddly.\n\nNow if you&apos;ll excuse me, I&apos;m gonna take a closer listen to this static coming from the radio. Let&apos;s see. Sounds like Uncle Jack! I can just make it out... &quot;Johnny. Reviews. Not funny. Quit. Now.&quot; Um, yeah, just as I thought - nothing but a little cross modulation! THE GIST White Noise is an interesting take on the ghost story, using the subject of EVP as its backdrop. It isn&apos;t what I&apos;d call scary, but it&apos;s got its share of creepy moments and effective jump scenes. If you&apos;re looking for a docu-drama on the scientific accuracy of EVP then you might be disappointed, but if you&apos;re in the mood for a few chills to start the year then White Noise just might suit you.\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)",

Macy with similar character at Martin Balsam), her sister(Julianna Moore-Vera Miles)along with Sam(Viggo Mortensen)are looking for to Marion, asking help to sheriff(Philip Baker Hall-John McIntire).\n\nThe story is a rip off from original classic picture,frame-for-frame, with a few news scenes though filmed in glimmer color and lensed beautifully by cameraman Christopher Doyle.Thus,it contains the same screenplay by Joseph Stefano and Robert Bloch infused with deliciously macabre wit,plenty of grisly murders,stabbing shots,horror,suspense and lots of blood.The highlights film are,of course,the famous murder of Marion Crane-Anne Heche completely copied scene-for-scene although with a few more nudism and the creepy final images where is turned out the killing conclusion.Again the suspenseful music score,adding impressive excitement,nowadays deemed a classic soundtrack by Bernard Hermann is arranged by Danny Elffman.The motion picture is regularly directed by Gus Van Sant(Drugstore cowboy,Elephant,among others),nowadays considered a cult-director.The original Hitchcock film is highly superior to this one and the numerous movies which tried duplicate it, like as : Psycho II(1983) by Richard Franklin,Psycho III(1986)by Anthony Perkins,and for cable TV :PsychoIV(1990)by Mick Garris",

The action was more subdued and less far-fetched as a typical Brosnan movie. I laughed my butt off in parts, and the cast pulled off their roles in a badass-yet-comical way!\n\nSalma Hayek adds some necessary female steam in this otherwise masculine tale! As always Pierce Brosnan delivers a wonderful performance helping to make this movie a real delight! \n\nI can&apos;t tell you much more about the movie without spoiling scenes, so, see this movie; it&apos;s worth the whatever price you pay.",

The first 1/3 of the film is a well stylized documentary but then this story, which goes from implausible to downright absurd. If the story wasn&apos;t true, you would find yourself thinking that the director was trying to string you along and at the very end pop out and say &quot;naw, I was just kidding&quot;. There are so many parts of it the require you to suspend belief only to remind yourself it was reality.\n\nWhile there maybe no new information, the ability to portray complex situations from the perspective of the participant remind us all that truth and the human condition are relative. You are left with unanswered questions, doubts and just shaking your head. Well polished, well executed and well edited, there are few documentaries that can suck you into them and actually wonder what is next.",

      "reviewBody": "THE RUNAWAYS chronicles the run of one of the most successful all-girl rock bands of all time. The film is based on &quot;Neon Angel&quot;, the autobiography of the band&apos;s original lead singer Cherie Currie, and it gives us a glimpse into the world of rock and roll as seen from the perspective of a group of teenage girls on their way to super-stardom. I had heard some good things about the film when it was first making the festival circuit, but I wasn&apos;t as impressed when I finally got a chance to see it myself. The cast did an amazing job in their roles but the film wasn&apos;t as great as it probably could have been.\n\nThe problem with music biopics, particularly for rock stars, is that most rock stars seem to encounter the same problems: sex, drugs, booze, addiction, conflicting personalities, etc. So we get a lot of repetition with each rock star film and RUNAWAYS is no different. Cherie&apos;s decline into addiction, the in-band conflicts, the initial excitement of success and the eventual succumbing to the stress and strain of maintaining the lifestyle. It&apos;s nothing we haven&apos;t seen before in other films, it&apos;s just happening to younger characters. It&apos;s fine though because the performances are strong enough that it&apos;s easy to forget that the material&apos;s nothing new. My main problem with the film was that it came across as unstructured. It felt as if the filmmakers had just strung along random interesting events in the Runaways history and it made it feel like the movie was just wandering along. As a result, the movie loses it&apos;s momentum after their first major gig and drags through the last half. It begins around the time Cherie begins to lose control which is a shame; I should be concerned for her character, not bored by the meandering storyline.\n\nThe film&apos;s saving grace is the cast. Kristen Stewart, Dakota Fanning, and Michael Shannon did an amazing job. Kristen Stewart has earned some major credibility with me thanks to this film. I was concerned that a girl famous for her role in the TWILIGHT saga would ruin such an iconic role (Joan Jett) but she did a fantastic job and seemed to embody her perfectly. Dakota Fanning is Cherie and I&apos;ve always thought of Fanning as one of the most talented young stars in Hollywood. She provides an innocence in Cherie&apos;s character at the start that makes the film interesting to watch when her stardom warps and destroys it. Shannon is the group&apos;s manager Kim Fowley. Fowley is apparently infamous for his aggressive style, and his training sessions with the Runaways are the best parts of the film.\n\nYou can&apos;t have a music film without the music that inspired it and the soundtrack to the film is awesome. It&apos;s loaded with music from the Runaways and Joan&apos;s later solo run. The filmmaker&apos;s transport you back to the late 70s with their dedication to the style, from the clothes to the music and the fads. The movie has all the ingredients to make a great bio movie, but the execution prevents it from rising to what it could&apos;ve been.",

      "name": "Enjoy the performances of Liam Neeson and Laura Linney",
      "reviewBody": "Liam Neeson is a terrific actor, and Dr. Alfred Kinsey is his character. After seeing &quot;Kinsey&quot; I can&apos;t imagine anyone else better for the role. People usually say that, I know, but you couldn&apos;t possibly imagine anyone else playing the part, ever. I think Neeson has a strong chance at winning an Oscar this year; as does Laura Linney, playing Kinsey&apos;s wife, a terrifically kind, warm woman trying to keep up with Kinsey&apos;s life, which moves along pretty fast. Too fast for her at times. These two performances are awesome, two of the actors&apos; best, the Academy, and every other awards show, would have to be insane not to mention them.\n\nUnfortunately, I don&apos;t think the rest of the movie is really up to par with the performances. Not to say it&apos;s bad, just that it fails to really interest us when Neeson or Linney aren&apos;t on screen (which, fortunately, doesn&apos;t happen much). The movie is about Alfred Kinsey, who pioneered the research on human sexuality. Neeson shows him as a strong man, but one with as many flaws as the gall wasps he collected, all buried deep beneath his drive and focus.\n\nKinsey&apos;s studies proved some things, and let a lot of homosexuality and other deviances from the norm at the time out into the open. I&apos;d just like to say that I agree with some of his studies, I like that he unlocked the way uptight supposed &quot;morality&quot; of the masses think that any sexual behavior other than the missionary position is both unhealthy and immoral. How they thought that I don&apos;t know, but I admire Kinsey for proving them wrong. Other things I do not agree with, like Kinsey&apos;s studies on the time it takes really young children to reach orgasmand Kinsey&apos;s way of thinking that sex on its basic level should have no emotional attachment; I think I can say that these things are ethically wrong without feeling ignorant.\n\nBut I won&apos;t be biased against the quality of the film because of this. I will speak of the technique of how it was made: the writing, the directing, etc. I liked how the movie began: with a black and white practice interview between Kinsey, his wife Clara, and their students. It is inter-cut with scenes from Kinsey&apos;s youth: Kinsey facing temptation with masturbation, and having trouble with his insanely strict father (John Lithgow).\n\nLithgow&apos;s first scene, where he speaks of the temptation and evil caused by zippers, electricity and ice cream parlors is the film&apos;s first problem. It doesn&apos;t show both sides of Kinsey&apos;s argument, it merely dismisses Lithgow  and those like him  as a laughing stock, instead of considering any validity in points that they&apos;re making.\n\nThis problem is carried throughout the movie, and Lithgow is seen as such a monster that we feel no sympathy for his character in a later scene showing his inner weakness and tragic past, the scene feels thrown in and very foreign to the rest of the movie.\n\nI think the opening scenes, with Kinsey and Clara first falling for each other, and his proposal and collection of gall wasps, are the movie&apos;s best, I believe. Once Kinsey starts his research on sex I think the movie becomes a bit conventional. We get the usual scenes such as Kinsey alienated from his family, Kinsey receiving trouble from his financial backers, Clara feeling alienated from Kinsey, and so on. Of course, most of the time we watch eagerly, because Neeson and Linney are awesome, but we still have that itching feeling that the film isn&apos;t as special as Ebert says.\n\nWhat I mean is, after decades of biopics, especially this year; a biopic has to be more than conventional. Unless the lead character is amazing and extremely watchable, like in &quot;Ray&quot;, the film needs to show us something new. I mean, when you see a biopic, you pretty much know the lead is going be alienated from his family, obsessed with his work and full of inner demons. So give us something else, please.\n\nProblems also arise with the introduction of Kinsey&apos;s staff, including bisexual Clyde Martin (Peter Sarsgaard), Wardell Pomeroy (Chris O&apos;Donnell) and Paul Gebhart (Timothy Hutton). The problem is, we hardly know any of these characters, so we are bored when they get into arguments because we don&apos;t feel that we know anything about them. When we find out that Martin is bisexual it comes as a surprise, but we react with a shrug. Sarsgaard&apos;s performance is surprisingly flat; that he&apos;s getting any buzz for awards surprises me.\n\nI&apos;m giving the movie a seven simply because of the professionalism Neeson and Linney display on screen. They are the acting pros; they wash the floor with the rest of the cast. The Academy voters will all be struck by lightning if either isn&apos;t mentioned. So see it for them, and about the rest, well, shrug.\n\n7/10",

That is one thing this movie did right - kept the titular creature mostly out of sight. Nothing is less scary than too much CGI.\n\nHowever, when the majority of the film is dark to the extent that you can barely see anything, I find I&apos;m too hacked off to be scared.\n\nThat&apos;s a shame, because as far as I could make out, the acting was decent, as were the script and story (hit or miss when it comes to Stephen King adaptations). A widowed father, a shrink, takes a walk-in who tells him a harrowing tale of kids dying at the hands of something supernatural, after which his own daughters start to experience spooky shenanigans.\n\nThere is the old trope of the parent taking far too long to believe their offspring, and a house in which any given light source only affects about a six inch circle around itself, but I think these would have been minor irritants if the filmmakers had considered that their audience might like to occasionally be able to work out what&apos;s happening on screen.\n\nAs it is, this was a semi-decent movie which had the potential to be better.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m proud of this film&apos;s success. Will Packer and Rainforest work hard and they deserve it. But this film is weak on so many levels. Being based on a &quot;self-help&quot; book, this screenplay was crammed with nothing but on-the-nose dialogue that left me bored and fidgety for the most part. Outside of Kevin Hart, there wasn&apos;t a single thing funny about this film. Okay, maybe once or twice I laughed but one time it was at something I don&apos;t think was meant to be funny (actor Romany Malco singing with his guitar). You can&apos;t call a film a comedy where only one character was remotely, or should I say barely humorous. I found more humor in dramas like American Beauty, City Lights, and The Graduate.\n\nThis film seemed to just flat-line from beginning to end. When I say flat, I mean literally flat. Nothing happened until the guy-meets-girl moments, and that took a while to get to. Once the relationships started, the weak conflicts seemed to be limited to the superficiality of Steve Harvey&apos;s best selling book. No inner conflicts, not even conflict on the extra-personal level.\n\nI could&apos;ve done without most of the characters which can read like a list of players on a football team. They had no purpose and added nothing to the telling, like the married guy amongst them, Bennett played by Gary Owen. I know a lot of people loved this film. But can anyone seriously say they got to know any of the characters? Also, I had a hard time buying most of the relationships. The worst of them all had to be Jerry Ferrara with Gabrielle Union. It was like having to suspend your disbelief watching them together and that didn&apos;t even work for me. I didn&apos;t believe they even knew each, let alone them being in a 13 year relationship. At a glance, I would faster believe Union was Ferrara&apos;s babysitter or nanny, not her man. It was one big spoof to me.\n\nThe next absurd relationship was Regina Hall and the guy from 106 and Park, Terrence Jenkins. I didn&apos;t believe he and Hall went to high school at the same time. In fact, she could&apos;ve passed for his mother as well.\n\nTaraji Henson&apos;s relationship with Michael Ealy was also hard to stomach, as I had trouble believing a woman with her success in business wouldn&apos;t question Ealy&apos;s facade.\n\nI liked the relationship between Meagan Good and Romany Malco but it was so contrived, like everything else about this film.\n\nAnd the next black film made showing black friends discussing their relationships while trying to play basketball should have little-tree car re-fresheners hanging from theater ceilings for the sake of audiences. Why? Because such expository scenes are a load of steaming crap. Guys don&apos;t stand around on the court discussing such things, or play ball while having those kinds of conversations. I know they did it in The Brothers (2001) and it was b.s. then as it still is now.\n\nThe telling had no direction, no point-of-view. It could&apos;ve been anyone or anything&apos;s story at any given time, which left me confused and disengaged. I was waiting for the fire hydrant&apos;s storyline eventually.\n\nI really wanted to like it, but I couldn&apos;t. In the end, I was dissatisfied and utterly annoyed.",

      "reviewBody": "Having suffered through the painfully pretentious and shallow, pseudo-Lynchian mess of Perfect Blue, I was understandably skeptical about watching another film by Satoshi Kon (I have not yet seen Millennium Actress, but am now quite intrigued to do so). Tokyo Godfathers (a title which at first struck me as belonging most probably to a pseudo-psychological mafia thriller) was not only a pleasant surprise; it was the best anime feature I&apos;ve seen in many years, probably since Ghost in the Shell, excluding anything by Hayao Miyazaki. Like the classic Grave of the Fireflies, Tokyo Godfathers struck me as unusual in the fact that it draws much from European cinema  English, Irish, German or Italian  while most commercial anime features try to mimic American film-making. But while Grave of the Fireflies was painfully sad and bleak, Tokyo Godfathers is irresistibly charming, and manages to be funny and incredibly touching at once like few anime films  few animated films, at that  ever achieve.\n\nTokyo Godfathers is remarkably non-violent, as pacifistic perhaps as Miyazaki&apos;s films. You won&apos;t find any grand futuristic structures or fantastical creatures here; in fact, the animation may seem crude at first. But the characters are where the film really hits its mark. Kon triumphs, like in his excellent series Paranoia Agent, by not succumbing to the accepted prototypes and standards of how characters should look in an anime film; the lead characters in the film are all gorgeously ugly, in a way that even Miyazaki had not yet dared to do. Even the child character, Miyuki, is chubby, and not cute and beautiful in the way little girls &apos;should&apos; be, by the unwritten laws of anime. Thus, Kon&apos;s characters are believable and true to life; they are three anti-heroes, outcasts from society, each running away from their pasts. Especially charming is Hana (AKA &apos;Uncle Bag&apos;), the golden-hearted transvestite, who supplies much of the film&apos;s comic relief but also some of its most touching moments.\n\nTokyo Godfathers  despite some far-fetched but amusing plot twists and coincidences  is at its core a very simple story, a beautiful little story about family, love and friendship. Few anime films are so unpretending; and thus, few anime films manage to be so strong. Watch Tokyo Godfathers; you&apos;ll laugh, you&apos;ll cry. And believe you me, ten minutes into it you&apos;ll forget it was ever animated.",

Jessica did what she could in the film. Jessica and Dane did work well together in the film.\n\nThere are characters you will feel like they shouldn&apos;t be there but with Dane, Dax and Jessica in the film you can just forget about the other characters that you don&apos;t like in the film. \n\nThe film story is really the selling point of course with Dane, Dax and Jessica being the main stars of the film.\n\nWith a good story and laugh out moments with good one liners you should enjoy this film.\n\nI give Employee Of The Month an 8 out of 10",

      "reviewBody": "In this film, set in the near future, brain implant technology allows one person to inhabit the mind, body, and spirit of another. A clandestine corporation uses this technology to assassinate wealthy and powerful people for profit. The film explores what happens when the host starts to fight to regain control from a guest who is not entirely mentally stable, to begin with.\n\nInteresting enough premise. The film is set in a very bleak version of the future where cities appear to be sparsely populated (perhaps from some event that greatly reduced the population such as plague or war; a motif borrowed from Argento&apos;s Tenebre). The film relies heavily on psychotropic imagery, and this adds to the overall frightening and confusing atmosphere since most of this imagery is nightmarish (distorted faces reminiscent of David Cronenberg&apos;s The Brood, warped colors, bursts of sound and images, blurs, rapid-fire images and strobing flashes of light). The film further relies on ultra-violence as a motif that rivals even the Italian slasher films of the late 1970s and early 80s (such as Susperia, Tenembre, Opera, etc.). Possessor contains explicit sexual motifs including full male nudity and erect penises, which reminds me very much of Antichrist (2009) or The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976). These are juxtaposed with explicit imagery of knives penetrating flesh. All of this results in a nightmare landscape. The ending is purposely left confusing so that that the viewer can arrive at their own conclusions. For some viewers, this will be frustrating.\n\nAll of this wraps up into a very worthwhile enough film, but for viewers with a more sophisticated palate (if you are looking for a Blumhouse type film Possessor is not what you are looking for). It is disturbing to be sure. However, it is very well made and anchored by two very outstanding performances from Andrea Riseborough and Christopher Abbott. It also features Jennifer Jason Leigh and Sean Bean in very laudable supporting roles (whether or not Sean Bean dies I will not spoil). Possessor is a &quot;Criterion Collection&quot; caliber film that will give the viewer some satisfaction analyzing and will with you long after you see it."

      "reviewBody": "Hector and the Search for Happiness (2014)\n\nI suppose the title makes clear that this is a journey and that it has some pitfalls. I mean, there is no easy solution to the problem of finding happiness. Unless you find that you had it all along. Such is the potential here as Hector (the hilarious and versatile Simon Pegg) leaves his somewhat normal but semi-nice girlfriend in London to search the world for true happiness. Yeah, really.\n\nSo it&apos;s a fable, of course. No one does this quite so easily or with such lucky (and grossly unlikely) connections along the way. But the clichés of happiness, beginning with plain old rich decadence, and then Tibetan monks who have some sense of pure deep undecadent innocent joy. And then a whole series of alternative of people who have some part of happiness. Hector takes notes and keeps going, his girlfriend frustrated but materially distracted in their posh pad. \n\nWhen things turn for the worse you know (since it&apos;s a fable) that it will not stay that way. New adventures arise.\n\nBut does he find happiness? Or is it, like Dorothy in Oz, a bit like you realize there is truly no place like home? \n\nWhat makes this very fun, very unexpected romp worthwhile above all is the funny fun and sometimes very serious performance by Pegg. He&apos;s got a well known screen presence from the wacky comedies (like &quot;Shawn of the Dead&quot;) and in a way he plays off of that here. But he also transcends it enough to make you believe there is more than meets the eye here. The whole movie is fun because he&apos;s fun to be with.\n\nAnd will you learn a thing about what makes people happy? I hope not, because this is a stream of clichés without much or any insight. You can shout—hey, that&apos;s not the point— but it still leaves the movie a bit superficial.\n\nIt leaves it very fun, too, however, and all is quite well in the end. See it. It&apos;s quite cheerful.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Extract&quot; works well with a majority of its audience. Reason is clear...the cast is very good, story is not boring or cheap; comedy is neither vulgar nor downright stupid; at ~90 minutes it doesn&apos;t bore anyone and it has a happy ending!!! Cast wise, a very good job. Jason Bateman plays the sex-deprived businessman role very well. Mila Kunis looks hot throughout the movie and that&apos;s exactly what her character was all about. Ben Affleck has a small but a very funny role. JK Simmons hardly does anything wrong about his acting. Others are good in their context.\n\nThe best thing about &quot;Extract&quot; is that the humor is maintained throughout the movie. It&apos;s neither cheap vulgar comedy nor downright stupid comedy. The comedy is an elaborate mix of these two poles and that&apos;s why this movie is like able. All the characters seem to be performing on a high wire and carry themselves very naturally. There is never a dull moment taking into account the short running time. Besides, the soundtrack is so cool. Really lovely songs.\n\nOverall, &quot;Extract&quot; is a good movie. Can&apos;t say it&apos;s a very good movie, but still I can guarantee few smiles for sure.\n\nMy Verdict: 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "It entertains. It&apos;s not the best sci-fi film I&apos;ve ever seen but it&apos;s reasonably high up the list and as a bonus, it keeps getting more interesting as it goes along and thankfully, the ending was fitting.\n\nA few suggestions for improvement: \n\nThe characters all seemed like strangers in the beginning and they all waited a set time for their turn to speak which gave the film quite a stilted effect. George Finn was the only one who didn&apos;t &apos;look&apos; like he was acting. Danielle Panabaker annoys me in most of her work because she tries to pull off being innocent and sweet when the character she&apos;s playing doesn&apos;t need it (either that or she just isn&apos;t any good at being &apos;sweet&apos;) - it comes across as being quite fake. The camera could have been expanded on for example; its creation, design, and they could have experimented with various settings. As it stands, I still don&apos;t know how they figured out certain things about the way it functioned (but I might have missed the explanation while munching).\n\nSome praise:\n\nMatt O&apos;Leary pulled off a really funny &apos;wtf are you talking about&apos; moment when his best friend and girlfriend were casually discussing a dead body. Although the opening scenes were jarring because of the lack of chemistry and low budget feel, with literally every scene, the film got more and more engrossing so stick with it. The story was really well written. It progressed at a good pace and although George Finn&apos;s character development seemed a bit over the top, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and for once, the ending was fitting and extremely satisfying.\n\nI think everyone involved should be really proud, any criticisms are fairly minor, and I can easily recommend this.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;What I wouldn&apos;t give to have tired of you.&quot; After a party makes her feel uneasy Joanna (Knightley) thinks that her husband Michael (Worthington) is cheating on her. The next day he leaves on a business trip, with the women (Eva Mendes). The same day Joanna runs into her past love and spends time with him. Both are tempted to do what they shouldn&apos;t. This is a movie that you have to let form. The first half hour or so is a little slow, but then it really starts to take shape and the ending will leave you wanting more. Being a man, this is not usually the type of movie that I enjoy, but I really did like this one. I would call this a more subdued version of &quot;Closer&quot;, much less overt sex and much more subtle love. Much like &quot;Closer&quot; you are pulled back and forth between who you like and who you don&apos;t. Who is right and who is wrong. Who you want to root for, and who you shouldn&apos;t. Either way this is a very emotionally powerful movie that will leave you wishing there was more. Overall, I surprisingly liked this movie a lot. This is a very emotional movie that will leave you thinking. That&apos;s a good thing. I give it a B+.\n\nWould I watch again? - I actually think I might."

      "reviewBody": "I agree with what many other reviewers say, about it being confusing but still pertinent and that it might go over many viewers&apos; heads because in general many Americans just have no idea that the US is still actively conducting warfare in Afghanistan. I feel like it was a pointed, clear message about our presence there, but that many of us were perhaps expecting another Fury or Inglorious Basterds. Others have spoken about all the characters in the movie, so I won&apos;t add anything, but I&apos;m amazed to see that no one has once mentioned Meg Tilly as Gen. Glenn McMahon&apos;s wife. I haven&apos;t seen Meg act in anything in ages, but this was a terrific and nuanced performance. Male soldiers with fewer lines and less screen time have merited call outs, but really, Meg Tilley was amazing, just as amazing as the wonderful Tilda Swinton or Ben Kingsley. Her eyes never left Brad Pitt, and you could just imagine what their thirty years of marriage must have been like. Her subtle gestures and half-spoken words created a picture of 30 years of unwavering loyalty and devotion to a man she adores and respects, but her face shows how much those often lonely years cost. When she said her final line of, &quot;I&apos;m proud of me too.&quot;, I found it thrilling. I hope we see more of her in the future, because she was definitely one of astonishing bright points in this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "The Great White goes back into the cinema in this flawed sequel.This bone-chilling movie based on the Peter Benchley&apos;s novel and written by Richard Matheson and Carl Gottlieb (screenwriter of the trilogy) , it packs some exciting scenes, thrills, chills and lousy direction. The film is developed at Florida in a seaside park , while the previous entries are set at in New England in a shore community named Amity .There ,people is terrorized by a giant shark that attacks pacific tourists at the undersea kingdom during the preview week. An underwater world that contains restaurant, cafeteria, aquarium and several other things.The sons ( Dennis Quaid and John Putch) of Police chief Brody ( Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary Jaws I,II) attempt to convince the park owner (Louis Gossett Jr) who reluctantly listen them to close the attraction . Meanwhile the giant shark attacks and the victims run afoul and making a real carnage and those serving for lunch. Then, an adventurer named Phillip(Simon MacCorkindale) and his helper determine to track down and kill it. The protagonists are forced to fight for their lives in a mortal confrontation.\n\nIt&apos;s an inferior following with average creation of tension,thrills,terror, emotions and brief gore. The story gets little relation to first two Jaws, except by father Sheriff Brody and sons relationship. The argument of this gratuitous following is partially similar to ¨Revenge of the creature¨(Jack Arnold) in which also a monster terrorizes a sea park. The shark attack images deliver the exciting united to creepy score composed and conducted by Alan Parker inspired on the classic soundtrack by the master John Williams (prized with an Oscar) who heightens the suspense. This below average movie features lousy interpretations of the quintet main star, Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr, John Putch and Lea Thompson (formerly to ¨Back to the future¨) . Regular cinematography by James A Contner (subsequently filmmaker) and is badly directed by Joe Alves, producer designer of the original film. While the classic picture by Spielberg obtained three Oscars well deserved and today considered an authentic classic, its tree sequels are much worst, and were respectively directed by Jeannot Swarc,Joe Alves and Joseph Sargent in annoying direction. Rating: Bottom of barrel, a real turkey. Only for theaters, its real asset are the 3D digital effects, for that reason in television lost their spectacular Tri-dimensional qualities.",

With more informal elements from Heat (1995) starring Al Pacino and Robert de Niro with an interweaving focus on both the criminal and the law enforcement characters and a relational theme reminiscent of The Bridges of Madison County with Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, this movie uses what seems like unnecessary experiment uses of the camera resulting in some odd off scene focuses and seems almost too slow in places with its pacing like the aging characters themselves. The strength of the movie though are its reflections on being old and the flashes of elegance as a criminal gentleman from Robert Redford. The storyline has some emotive punch and a bit of drama, yet it also becomes unnecessarily puzzling towards the end with how the criminal justice system metes out justice. The ending itself seems more of a puff ball ending that avoids the more poignant meaningful conclusion to a life of crime.",

      "reviewBody": "Dolores Claiborne is directed by Taylor Hackford and adapted to screenplay by Tony Gilroy from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, David Strathairn, John C. Riley, Christopher Plummer and Judy Parfitt. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Gabriel Beristain.\n\nPlot sees Leigh as Selena St. George, a big-city reporter who travels to her home town island in Maine when her mother is accused of murdering the elderly woman that she was caring for. Her estranged mother, Dolores (Bates), is also widely suspected to have killed her husband and Selena&apos;s father some 20 years earlier, even though that was ruled as an accident. As mother and daughter come together, secrets of the past merge with the harshness of the present.\n\nA terrifically well acted and well mounted drama doing justice to a great book, Dolores Claiborne thrusts family trauma to the front of an on going murder investigation. King adaptations are well known for being very hit and miss, but this is certainly one of the better ones, it sees a shift from standard horror monsters, to monsters of a different kind, the human ones. Played out to a perpetually dank backdrop of rain, grey skies and a sea devoid of beauty, film unfolds to reveal the sadness of one family&apos;s roots, where emotional discord hangs heavy, constantly.\n\nThe structure is well handled by Hackford, as present day scenes merge into those from the past, giving off a perfectly ghost like feel to the plotting. Plummer&apos;s weary detective John Mackey is a bit too underwritten for my liking, and the time afforded the pre-trial debate and inquest is simply not enough to make the required impact once all the revelations come tumbling forward - the latter of which is nearly unforgivable given the film runs at over two hours. However, slight irks aside, this is still great stuff and if only for the trio of lead lady performances then this is a must see for the drama seeking film fan whom wants some intelligent emotional heft in the screenplay. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;American Animals&apos; is, formally, a difficult film to describe. It retains the structure of the heist films that came before it, even referencing them from time to time, cementing it as a disciple of those pioneers. Where the film stands out, however, is in the way it tells its story, in a non-linear fashion that seamlessly blends between the reality and fiction of this true-crime narrative. Whereas documentaries often use dramatisations to help visually realise their subject matter, here, these dramatisations take centre stage, supported by the painfully real inflections of those who were actually involved in this 2004 heist. This conflux, use to provide commentary, as well as irregular but welcome flair within the recreated narrative, help to differentiate &apos;American Animals&apos; from other films of its pedigree. Furthermore, these aforementioned recreations feature standout performances from the likes of Evan Peters and Barry Keoghan, further distancing Layton&apos;s film from the somewhat shabby predecessors that deploy similar techniques. On a technical level, the film is fairly regular, lacking inspiration with its cinematography which arguably helps ground the events which it portrays. The score nicely compliments the action on-screen, effectively building upon the tension set up by the visuals. The film can, however, drag in places, particularly during the first act, whereupon it hits familiar story beats that could have been addressed quicker, the time taken with the set-up juxtaposing the otherwise revolutionary approach the film takes to the heist formula. Otherwise, the third act is nothing short of thrilling, with the conclusion proving a melancholic reminder of the reality of these events, and the impact they can carry, with its audacity to allow the audience to decipher the difference between what is true and false. &apos;American Animals&apos; is a heist film through and through, but differentiates itself from others through the methods by which its tells its story and provides connections between the characters and audience. Whilst the pacing can prove problematic at times, persistence ultimately proves rewarding. Should Layton continue to adopt this unique approach to other genres, he may become a standout in years to come.",

Bless my lucky stars, I was wrong. Mel Gibson is frozen by Norm from Cheers after his girlfriend goes into a coma. He wakes up in 1992 (he slept in 1939) to a whole new world. No sappiness, and Mel Gibson wasn&apos;t even sucking as hard as he tends to suck (see &quot;What Women Want&quot; for really hard sucking).\n\nI really liked this film, it kept me from going to sleep on time. You&apos;ll like it, too, and maybe even more if you watch it with a date because it&apos;s really about how love lasts forever. (They say &quot;diamonds&quot; last forever, but those materialistic bastards wouldn&apos;t know real love if it woke up from a 50-year slumber!!!!)

Nine people&apos;s lives are linked together at the same moment in time, all with life changing results.\n\nThis film actually has no plot, but rather details the actions of all of the nine people leading up to that fated moment and shortly after. Interestingly, it is all about the freak timing and some very stupid or cruel choices that people make. Sometimes those ill-thought out actions can have devastating results.\n\nWhile this film does not fall under the heading of &quot;enjoyable evening of entertainment&quot; for me, it is a MUST see film for teenagers and their parents. It is not preachy, but very matter-of-fact blunt. Actions do have reactions, as well as consequences. There is also a difference between &quot;harmless fun&quot; and &quot;stupidly dangerous&quot;.",

This was more of a fantasy-horror film where you are supposed to be as much enthralled by the creatures as you are &apos;afraid&apos; of them.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed how the creatures looked, moved, and acted. It reminded me of a more modern-made version of the little imps from the movie &quot;The Gate.&quot; Instead of dreading them and being on the edge of my seat, I was waiting to see them and their antics again. Perhaps that&apos;s why the other reviewers are angry. Perhaps this film has been mis-marketed.\n\nIf you like creepy little bipedal monsters that look like imps/goblins, then this movie is for you. If you like fantasy monsters and played Dungeons and Dragons as a kid then you will enjoy this film. If you enjoy medieval European folklore and cryptozoology then you will be as entertained as I was.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;A woman is like a tea bag – you never know how strong she is until she gets in hot water.&quot; - Eleanor Roosevelt \n\nHow many of us would fight as hard as Sandra (Marion Cotillard) to keep her job? I suppose we would try to keep it, but she has to convince a majority out of 16 fellow workers to vote her employment rather than their 1000 Euros bonuses. She journeys in this intense film like some mythical mariner to each island person to convince that they should vote for her.\n\nNot only does Sandra experience a heavy dose of humiliation by virtually begging to be kept as an employee, she also has to deal with her insecurity and the accompanying dependence on drugs to help her through this challenge and her recent depression. The film&apos;s limitation is the repetition for each co-worker she visits, as if they just repeat the script for each visit. Even when one segment turns violent, it&apos;s as if writer/directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne injected action in an otherwise flat line of activity. Overall, the Dardennes further their thematic interest in socialistic causes.\n\nWhat elevates this drama into Oscar consideration is Cotillard, dressed not like a movie star (see La Vie en Rose and Midnight in Paris) but a working girl, little makeup accompanied by sleeveless tees and serviceable jeans. Make no mistake; she still is one of the world&apos;s most attractive actresses, my current fav. However, here she is believable as a vulnerable mother grasping for her job that the family desperately needs to survive.\n\nYes, although she has a contributing husband, Manu (Fabrizio Rongione), he is unusually supportive, almost to a fault. Yet, dramatically, he&apos;s positioned well to keep her in the forefront. She&apos;s not Sally Field&apos;s Norma Rae, who fights for a union in her textile mill, because Sandra&apos;s cause is personal in the 21st century, where Norma&apos;s in the &apos;70&apos;s is about collectivism. Both women, however, have an intelligence and wit to get them through. As far as I&apos;m concerned, that&apos;s part of what feminism is about."

      "reviewBody": "Although it&apos;s difficult to watch Mel Gibson now without the backdrop of alcoholism, abuse, bigotry, rants and disappointment, this role may actually be the perfect role for him to re-appear on the screen with sympathy and hope of redemption. He plays this role perfectly and the viewer is sucked into the emotion and distress of all characters dealing with their own challenges. It&apos;s a beautiful movie with a powerful message. Some have criticized Jodie Foster&apos;s directing, but I found the film to be very balanced with the right amount of comedy and tragedy. I loved the camera work and editing, especially with the Beaver as its own character. I also liked the secondary storyline about the teenagers. All the performances were very good. I think the entire movie is very well done, and although I have not changed my personal opinion of Mel Gibson at all, the movie does make you very sympathetic towards families dealing with crisis including his own, and as an actor, he pulls off a very difficult role.",

      "reviewBody": "18 October 2004. This much funnier version of Shall We Dance, is a delicious, romantic comedy that doesn&apos;t require magical, unbelievable script devices to make this movie work. This movie is compelling for those who believe in second chances and first chances for those who have never taken chances. This movie comes at a good time in American life when our lifestyles are such that we may be coming to that age that for everything we have, we still are empty. I don&apos;t imagine that this movie will dazzle any male ego and will probably be restricted to females who can only wish their partners might somehow be so interested. A good date movie for the emotionally sensitive and artistically inclined. This new version based on the Japanese original explores the comic motif well, doesn&apos;t take a lot of liberties on the sexual romance angle that so often befalls American movies, and ends up with a definitely American tie off but with a much more realistic and hopefully plausible note than most gushy romance movies. Eight out of Ten Stars.",

It is a sensitive but sexy movie about a woman in her forties and her post-divorce encounters with different feelings like hatred, low self-esteem, domestic problems and her personal life. Amidst all the things going wrong with a woman who is in a situation where she had been cheated by her husband, she finds something which perhaps is the most important thing in this world, &quot;Friendship&quot;. Catherine Zeta Jones looks lovely throughout. I literally fell in love with her after watching the movie. Not just because she is beautiful but the emotions portrayed by her are extremely believable and life like. She portrays the role presented to her with perfection and looks plausible as a single mother raising two kids. Moreover, No matter what others say, I feel the chemistry between her and Justin Bartha (The Hangover Groom), if not tremendously magical, was just right for the movie. The movie is never uninteresting and did keep me glued to the screen. It makes you smile in places with some witty and amusing scenes and also imparts some wisdom about life and any relationship. I wouldn&apos;t say that it is something worth not missing but if you are a planning on watching it, I guarantee you that your ninety minutes would not be wasted.",

Yeah, this isn&apos;t a good movie. It&apos;s clunky and awkward, it&apos;s forced and ridiculous but it is in no way as awful as it&apos;s made out to be. This is a forgettable nonsense movie that would be perfectly at home replaying on daytime tv for the hundredth time.

      "reviewBody": "Yet another vanity project for Lopez, this time as an action hero with fur coats, and the same hair and makeup in pretty much every scene, even if the scenes are 12 years apart. This film needed a more versatile actress, one that would lose the long hair locks and have it messed up, one that could handle - and look convincing, with some dirt and scratches on her face, one who can show some facial expressions relevant to each scene, not the constant &quot;ya I&apos;m tough&quot; expressionless look and tone.\n\nNext we have a story that took three prolific writers who&apos;ve written some great films and series in the past, to come up with a monotonous, repetitive, cliched and underwhelming screenplay with bits from many better films in this genre. The poorly paced nearly two-hour runtime felt much longer with many dragged out, unnecessary and predictable scenes. You know exactly what&apos;s going to happen, and you waste time watching it happen stretched out for so long, you can just fast-forward and not miss a thing. Top that all off with a director that decided to use a blurred fish-eye lens effect in some scenes, I thought I was having migraine episodes.\n\nHad a more convincing actress been cast, it may have made the dull filmmaking a little more bearable, but combined all together, it&apos;s not the gift any mom would want for Mother&apos;s Day. It&apos;s a pass from me, and a very generous 6/10, all for the young Lucy Paez as Zoe, who was the only one that shined in this dull action thriller.",

      "reviewBody": "Reviews thus far have not mentioned Carl Jung, the psychoanalyst, or how Cosmopolis can be interpreted as a dream using Jungian symbology. Cronenberg&apos;s previous movie was about Freud and Jung, so it is no artificial stretch to assume that he would apply Jung to a story, or that De Lillo had also done the same.\n\nIn Jungian dream analysis, the limousine can be taken as a metaphor of one&apos;s self, one&apos;s course in life. Each visitor to the limousine ought to be considered an aspect of the occupant&apos;s personality, each separate and distinct. There is the intellectual who has been hired to &quot;do theory,&quot;the young one who has been hired to find patterns, the nervous security expert who has tested for system vulnerabilities, the visiting prostitute (profane) who is asked to help obtain &quot;the chapel&quot; (sacred). Each character represents an aspect of a single self. Throughout the journey to get a &quot;haircut,&quot; (which is a Wall Street term for taking a loss), the outside security chief relays messages from &quot;The Complex,&quot; which might be interpreted as the unified self.\n\nI think this is clearly what Cronenberg intended. The fuller meaning of the movie resides in how the dream reflects the actual world, how it fits with the shared reality in which we all participate. How does this simple journey to get across the city reflect the pleasures and perils of existence? Can we really know the world, or can we only know ourselves? How is the main character a representation of the whole world, which has a kind of self, too? Does the ending of the movie reflect an outcome that is metaphorically plausible as an integration of macroeconomic, political, human forces shaping history? \n\nCosmopolis is an intellectual work, carefully crafted, and not at all pretentious, as some have said."

      "reviewBody": "Peter Rabbit is one of my favorite kid&apos;s movie of the year so far. It&apos;s an adorable film that is perfect for the whole family. I love this film because of the acting and CGI. \n\nPeter Rabbit follows Peter Rabbit, Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton Tail and Benji as they get into mischief by taking vegetables from the garden next door. They take the vegetables from Mr. McGregor who tries desperately to get them out of their garden by using explosives and even an electric fence. The rabbits hang out with loveable characters like Bea. She helps the rabbits by giving them shelter when it rains and helps them get food.\n\nThroughout the movie, we see great acting from all the actors and voice actors in the film. I love how Domhnall Gleeson acts like a soulless man with the rabbits who he is trying to kill, but with Bea, he acts like in he&apos;s love. I found that Mr. McGregor (Domhnall Gleeson) really does seem to be in love with Bea. I also like how the voice actors portray the rabbits. Each one of them has a personality that is well portrayed in their voices and actions. For example, Cotton Tail is a memorable character because of how wild and reckless she is. The way Daisy Ridley voices her shows how wild she can be. \n\nThe CGI in this film is extraordinary. The animals look so realistic. If you really focus on the rabbits, you can see the individual hairs on them. You can also see it on the pig character that hangs out with the rabbits. During a fight sequence with Peter and Mr. McGregor, they actually look like they are fighting and not like he is fighting a fake bunny. \n\nI rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 7 to 12. \n\nReviewed by Carla P., KIDS FIRST!

While the chemistry between Lawrence and Robbins is quite strong, the highlight of the film is Lawrence at home getting his face smacked repeatedly by his mother.

Why conceal the identity of the killer when he turns out to be a subsidiary character who is built into the story in the last half hour?\n\nPatricia Clarkson makes for a bland leading lady (despite a knockout figure) and has little chemistry with Eastwood. So, placing her in jeopardy creates no suspense. Also, having Harry surrender his legendary sidearm doesn&apos;t fit well with previous installments, since he has a clear head shot with the killer. Finally, having Harry find the harpoon gun shown in a previous scene is just a little too incredible.\n\nBuddy Van Horn, as a director, is no Eastwood, but he does a pretty good job. Most of the stunts are quite good and the cinematography is excellent. Lalo Schifrin&apos;s score is bouncy, but forgettable.\n\nToo bad, as a little script reworking would have made for a very good &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; effort. As it is, however, &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; is the weakest of the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; series.",

      "reviewBody": "Hayes is a suave, distinguished spy with the CIA who is part of a set up to buy a stolen nuclear weapon and then capture those involved.  When he is killed mid-operation, his handler goes to the only man who can replace him, his twin brother.  However his brother Jake is a hustler in New York City and not spy material.  Oakes has nine days to get him ready to take over his brother&apos;s identity and take up the assignment.\n\nDespite the awful reviews, I still decided to give this film a go because I was in the mood for a dumb film that really didn&apos;t require me to think even once: this was that film!  The film deserved every bad review it got - the only thing you need to worry about is whether or not you can accept the massive weakness or not.  The plot is a real shambles and if you think about it logically then it all goes to hell.  The idea that this is a reasonable plot, even for this type of film, is absurd.  The script backs this up with dialogue that is fitting for a stupid comedy but not for the situations in the plot (`does it play dvd&apos;s?&apos; or dialogue about Dr&apos;s Dre and Irving while trying to stall terrorists).  Some of it is funny, but to be honest, if you dislike Chris Rock then there will be practically nothing for you.\n\nThe plot brings the bomb back to the US towards the end in an effort to inject tension and urgency into the action, but it doesn&apos;t really work. The action is reasonably slick but it isn&apos;t ever really exciting - only polished like a product.  The action, like everything else, is quite clichéd and not distinctive enough to really stand out from the crowd of other action movies.  The gags about race are subtle but still quite broad in the style of Rock.  I didn&apos;t find it offensive, but I never really understand why films have to constantly perpetuate racial myths such as all black people listen to hip hop and like certain sports etc. Some of it is funny though.\n\nRock is the main reason for this; as I said, if you like him then you should enjoy this as most of the comedy is driven by him (even if nothing is anywhere near the sharpness of his act).  He is not very funny but he helps the film have an overall comic tone that works pretty well  Hopkins is totally slumming it.  He manages an air of cool detachment but the material is way below him and his autopilot light is on the whole time.  Stomare is poor and none of the villains really bring genuine menace - Eastern European hoods and clichés that they are.  Beauvais is sexy - but that is all she is here for, to put on black underwear! Her character breezes in and breezes out with no real reason or consequence, plainly all she is here for is to have a bit of sexy black ass in there - something that Washington doesn&apos;t bring.\n\nOverall this is a slickly made film that is clichéd, absurd, undistinguished and not as entertaining as it intends to be.  Despite the fact that the film is very average and not really one to stand out, it can be quite enjoyable if you are ready for that. If you can turn off your brain and lower your standards then this can be OK, however just don&apos;t expect it to be great no matter what you do."

If you put in every animated film ever made, and set it to the highest setting, you may come out with something like Planes.\n\nYou have the plucky young dreamer who seems destined to a life of drudgery, but aspires for higher things. He has a stoopid best friend, who is charming in his own special way. There is an elderly mentor, who initially turns down the whippersnapper when he asks for his help... but gosh darn it, he changes his mind once he sees how determined the kid is. The bad guy is an irredeemable moustache-twirler with two giggling goons who follow him around everywhere. A &apos;comedy relief&apos; is a cheeseball Mexican who is obsessed by dance and romance (of course, and this guy outstays his welcome from his first syllable). As for the love interest, she starts off working for the evil dudes, but soon discovers her true feelings, and...\n\nSo on, and so forth. There isn&apos;t one original idea in the whole farrago... and that&apos;s without even getting into the recycled story or the below par animation. The fact is, this is film-making by committee: it ticks every box, caters for every demographic but missing that all important ingredient: soul.

Overall though it failed to deliver on the promising looking opening credits. It lacked any real tension or suspense, the story felt underdeveloped with too many subplots and a lot of it just fails to convince. Many parts of the film are just not believable enough.\n\nThe acting is fairly strong and there are a couple of elegant visual touches;(Farrell in the car for example).In my opinion,the soundtrack is the best thing about the film. Serge Pizzorno from Kasabian had a hand in the music on this one and he has done a good job with a 60&apos;s/70&apos;s spaghetti western/French art-house vibe if you can imagine such a thing!\n\nFinally its worth noting that I asked my girlfriend to contribute her thoughts after seeing the film and she gave me a one word reply...........&quot;sh*te&quot;",

Many of them must read their lines and convey body language that is ambiguous, suggesting both guilt or innocence and good or evil. The talented cast accomplishes this superbly. The story (based on a book of the same name which I haven&apos;t read) intelligently and knowledgeably examines the morality of the legal system and how it is compromised because of human fallibility. All in all, this was a very engrossing motion picture. Strongly recommended, 8/10.",

The movie is about a cop who is probably the lowest scumball in the history of modern cinema and how he tries to find redemption in solving the case of a nun who is raped inside a Catholic church. The film is very graphic and terribly depressing but that doesn&apos;t make it a bad film. It is well written, well edited by Anthony Redman, well shot by Ken Kelsch and very well directed by Abel Ferrara. The cast is pretty insignificant when you consider the whole film is about Harvey Keitel&apos;s character. Keitel is the complete center of this movie and he holds it together. His performance is one of the best in recent movie history and this film is worth watching just to see how far Keitel will go for his art.",

      "reviewBody": "A horror classic and for all the right reasons. I am a huge fan of this movie and really appreciate what it does. This is my third time watching it and it only gets better.\n\nWe follow a group of people all hit by a curse. The curse dose all in it&apos;s power to kill anyone who comes into contact with it. It is a pure evil that doesn&apos;t discriminate.\n\nThe movie can have a cheap feel to it with it&apos;s effects, makeup and camera work, but I find this inspirering. It can feel a bit student filmish and it&apos;s clear the creators used the budget well. The team clearly had to be inventive with everything and it inspires a guy like me that would love to make a movie myself. The movie is still well done and still works amazingly for me.\n\nThe movie is well shot from a camera perspective and creates some iconic frames and moves. It works more like a fly on the wall instead of the chatecters POV. Showing us things we don&apos;t want to see that it would scare us. It does this very effectively. There is some wierd camera moves here and there but overall I find it really well shot.\n\nThe acting seems good without me having a great knowledge about the Japanese language. The preformances seem good and believable. There is some amazing scream queens in this movie, and the actors that plays the spirits do brilliantly. They stay in charecter and sell the lost spirits really well.\n\nThe sets are so well done because they look like the everyday world. They don&apos;t look produced like the typical American set, and invites you into peoples homes and something familiar to the viewer. It feels like an intrusion on the private and makes you want to check your hallways a second time before going to bed. The sets are also well thought-out, with details you&apos;ll notice after a second watch.\n\nThe evil in this movie is pure. It feels pointless to fight it and that it can&apos;t be stopped. You feel as hopeless as the chatecters and having an unstoppable evil is dreadful and depressing. The movie shows us all the affected and how they die and the evil seems unstoppable no matter what. Young or old, it doesn&apos;t discriminate, it&apos;s just evil.\n\nThe movie is full of iconic frames and sequences. From the stairs scene towards the end, to the elevator scene, the bed scenes and the wheelchair reveal. All are perfectly made, iconic and scary scenes.\n\nThe movie is tied well together but could easily also be wieved as an anthology movie. All the different segments are thier own mini-movie that all are well crafted on their own. No segments feels overshadowed and Works all on their own. The overall ties works great too though and towards the end you learn more and more about the curse.\n\nNow here is probably the hardest sell about the movie but an aspect I liked. The movie is told out of chronological order and can be hard to follow the first time watching. I had problems following the plot the first time I&apos;ll gladly admit. But I appreciate watching it the second time and the third, I could apeiciate the movie even more. The movie really helps you to follow it&apos;s narrative though. It tells you early on that it&apos;s out of order and eases you through the different chatecters and tells and shows you how they are all connected. Don&apos;t be on your phone during this movie, pay attention and you&apos;ll have an easier time following the narrative.\n\nIf you couldn&apos;t tell I love this movie. I find it scary, well done and really depressing in it&apos;s subject matter. It is an iconic movie for a reason, it dares to do a lot and gets away with it. I would highly recommend it.",

However, its convoluted plot, lack of suspense, and pacing issues receive criticism. Some viewers suggest watching it at a faster speed for better enjoyment.

Both look like they&apos;re in their 40s, in fact Grusha Kapoor looks a year or two younger\n\nThe entire film functions on the same level of absurdity in every aspect. Everyone is strangely blasé about the murder and police but they all have their secrets\n\nApparently Sara and Vijay are the same age, and she was taller than him when younger. I have absolutely no idea how old Sara is supposed to be in this scenario. Are they both 25? Are they both 45?\n\nEither way, the film is kind of fun, even if it is super shallow. No idea why its listed as horror though.\n\nOverall its a pleasant watch, has interesting characters, and the mystery is decently cloaked till the end.",

      "reviewBody": "A sophisticated romantic story that involves an experience of a woman who finds herself in different relations in one with a stranger who make her feel special and in another where she feels like a stranger.\n\nI think the director of the movie did a brilliant job. James Ivory quite literally brought the Historical period like Edwardian-Era(just found out victorian era came before Edwardian-era) to us although both era had the same old royalty vibe, which feels so elegant, prosperous and rich in it&apos;s touch. The choosen Background masterfully reciprocate the respected time of era and their people.\n\nActing is clean and precise. Actors doesn&apos;t over or underperform instead they keep it just right enough to tell the beautiful romantic drama that arises between the parties. There are so many actors and each of them keeps the quality of their character alive making the conflict between them intense and interesting.\n\nCinematography and music is amazing. It is something to appreciate every once in a while. It makes the scenes more fun to watch and giving them a sense of sweetness and humor, which is comforting to watch.\n\n8/10, actually I would give it 8.5.\n\nAnd Thank you for reading this :)",

Gunny Highway comes across as the exact fellow you would want covering your ass in any tough situation you could possibly imagine. And Eastwood plays him perfectly with steely resolve, devotion, humor and a healthy touch of irreverence. Its great to see the transformation of Highway&apos;s squad, as well as the final moment of judgment for the totally hateful, obnoxious and bureaucratic Maj. Powers. (Oh, if only such b*****ds would get their deserved comeuppance in real life in such a manner, what a beautiful world it would be!)\n\nThe only real fault is the attempt to compare a minor police action in Grenada with Vietnam and Korea, &quot;I guess we&apos;re not 0, 1 and 1 anymore.&quot; I mean, give me a break, Korea and Vietnam went on for years and killed millions! Grenada involved a couple of hundred casualties over a couple of days. Please! But I suppose in 1986 the American people were desperate for some kind of heroes. Its just that that kind of jingoism would have been much more appropriate after Desert Storm than Grenada. That being said, its still a very good movie with a fundamental message about values, loyalty and comradeship that we could easily have more of these days, besides, Clint is just great!",

And it was an Honour to see Mr.Bachchan in such a terrific role. every one was just phenomenal. Piyush Mishra did a good job as well. and those three girls Of course,what a great privilege for them to share screen with the Shehanshah himself.:) The movie will be having a good grip on you through out the Runtime The movie is not &quot;Damini&quot; of modern age. This is a tight slap on all those so called &quot;Sanskari uncles and aunties&quot; that judge girls by what they wear. Every person not just a male,but this is was for every gender. It asks just a single question to the society i.e &quot;WHY&quot; why don&apos;t you just let girls do whatever they want to do. At least let them smile or laugh for god sake. please don&apos;t just wait for someone to point out some faults in your daughter,sister or mother. If you can worship &quot;female gods&quot; then for god sake just respect the ones you have in your society.",

Once again, for a fan I think this film still has enough laughs be be mildly entertaining but there&apos;s no doubt this is where the series started to slip away. While there aren&apos;t as many laughs here as the previous two films the thing manages to stay alive due to the nice characters created by the cast. Guttenberg, Smith, Graf, Winslow and Leslie Easterbrook are back with Bob Goldthwait and Tim Kazurinsky returning from the second film. The movie tries to have a plot with the academy threatened to be shut down but of course this just sets up all the attempted laughs. The best moments of the movie happen as we get a semi-remake of the original film as we see the new recruits going through their training. This film only runs 83-minutes, which certainly wasn&apos;t the normal thing in 1986 so that should tell you that the screenplay doesn&apos;t go for too much."

Many smaller nations, like Estonians, did not choose sides, they just tried to survive and carry on, splendidly expressed through tangerines in the film, but remote weaponry reaches everywhere and does not ask questions (Estonians were not considered hostile by both sides). \n\nAll this is nicely presented in this Estonian-Georgian film, where Estonian actors used are all famous film actors (the Georgian ones were unfamiliar to me, but they were convincing), and characters seem very realistic. As far as I know, the topic of honour and keeping word are holy among the Caucasus nations, enabling to depict scenes and events odd and even improbable among the Western, &quot;civilized&quot; nations. The venue is limited to the remains of a village, but as everything is so properly constructed and performed, you do not feel embattled, and can follow and emphasize with all characters, significantly widening the audience and letting ponder on and over the essence of warfare. \n\nPS The film is totally &quot;male&quot;, only actors were present, no actresses, but the less than 1,5 hours pass tautly.",

      "reviewBody": "A suspenseful thriller that does not keep you still until 20-25 minutes in the film. At first, I think that it was building tension. But the &quot;action&quot; was not that intense until the last 15 minutes I guess.\n\nI want to mention that I watched this film about 5 times, of whom the first time was when I was a lot younger than now.\n\nBack then, I really liked the film. It was intense for my then standards and creepy as well, because I could imagine how scary could be If I would live a similar situation. It really touched my naïve psychology.\n\nNow, being a little bit older, and of course watching it for the fifth time, I can tell for sure that it&apos;s a little bit boring. This argument is not fair, because since I&apos;ve watched it so many times, I knew every detail of the film, so definitely it wouldn&apos;t surprise me.\n\nI also want to mention that this is a remake of a 1970s film that I&apos;ve not watched yet, so obviously I can not compare these two films.\n\n(+) Pros\n\n*Very beautiful photography and directing.\n\n*The house was big, isolated and lost in the mist. Absolutely perfect for these type of films, although it can be some times a little bit cliché.\n\n*The protagonist was not perfect, but cute.\n\n*The reveal 20 minutes before the ending, at least the first time I watched this, was very cool and scary as well and since I haven&apos;t been watching horror films back then, it wasn&apos;t predictable to me at least.\n\nNote: By today&apos;s standards, and with all the horror films that keep releasing one after another, maybe for a person that has not watched the film, can be again predictable. I&apos;m not sure anyways.\n\n*Although it&apos;s a remake and its plot isn&apos;t original (there is no parthenogenesis in art), I personally like these type of films. When it has to do with a stalker that suffer from psychological problems, and harrasses a girl. Very typical plot, but still, I&apos;m into it.\n\n*I like that this story actually, with the babysitter, is an urban legend, and it is portrayed pretty good.\n\n*I liked the scene in the greenhouse. Maybe the second most intense scene in the whole film.\n\n*I personally liked the fact that there wasn&apos;t so much talking. I mean, of course there is talking, but I enjoyed more the silent scenes. It gave an alternative creepy tone.\n\n(-) Cons\n\n*I would prefer to not see the face of the killer.\n\n*I think that the part with protagonist&apos;s friend was a little bit unnecessary. I know that there was a background, but the conclusion was not important I think. I feel that they just wanted to put something extra. This is not neccessarily bad, but I was kinda thinking of it. I do not consider it bad, technically.\n\n*In the beginning the flow of the plot was very slow, and I had in my mind that &quot;It builds tension&quot;. In reality, the tension would come and go.\n\n*There were a lot of jump scares that made on purpose. They were very cliché. The one with fire, the one with music, the one with mannequin... they were very basic jump scares, that they felt that they had to put them into the film, so it could be labelled &quot;horror&quot; by force. Basically, there wasn&apos;t creativity...\n\n*Conclusion*\n\nTo be honest, it&apos;s not a bad film, and I feel that it is very misunderstood. I think that my rating and my review are basically of my thoughts now. Good or not, I&apos;ve watched it a lot of times, like I cited, so there wasn&apos;t surprise to me. If I would watch today the film for the first time, it could get a 7/10. I personally recommend it, because it&apos;s one of my childhood horror films since I&apos;m millenial.",

      "name": "With Jackie Chan behind the production and the time to perfect it, Legend of Drunken Master winds up becoming a martial arts legend itself",
      "reviewBody": "To describe Legend of Drunken Master is almost impossible. It has so much, it does so much, and it delivers in so many ways, you cannot really describe the experience. Legend of Drunken Master stands as Jackie Chan&apos;s best film, and arguably the greatest martial arts film in history. That&apos;s right Bruce Lee fanatics, it tops most/arguably all Lee films. Surely Lee had the strength and the power; but did not have the ensemble cast that Chan had, nor did Lee have any fights that can top the ones the Drunken Master engaged in throughout the 105 minutes of this kung fu madhouse.\n\nWith a decent plot, good acting, and a dash of humor to go along with the frenzied action, Legend of Drunken Master is one of those rare complete martial arts films that do more than just throw fights at you. Honestly, there has yet to be a perfect martial arts film. Whether its bad acting, a weak plot, too much focus on action, a pointless romantic story attached, or way too over-the-top substance, there hasn&apos;t been a martial arts film worthy of being up there with the best films in the modern era. Jui Kuen II (as they call it overseas) is the closest to the complete package as you can get.\n\nWe start the film off with Jackie Chan as the tough yet uncontrollable young kid by the name of Wong Fei-hung who accidentally takes a seal from British smugglers. The smugglers, also involved in overworking Chinese men in a factory resembling slave-like sweatshop of some sort, want the seal back. In the meantime, Wong&apos;s controversial fighting technique, drunken boxing, has been met by disapproval of his father, and wants him to refrain from ever using it. Drunken boxing also has a lot of competition and shun from others in the community. Chaos follows as soon as the British and their henchmen find out who has the seal, and vow to do whatever it takes to get it back and to spread fear in the community.\n\nThe plot isn&apos;t groundbreaking, but its something different than the average martial arts film. While it still contains the themes of family, honor, respect, and dignity contained in most Chinese movies of this genre, the preservation of Chinese art is a concept not used often. Nonetheless, it works, as we see the traditional values of the Chinese being threatened by the more modern mechanisms of the Europeans. There is also a major issue with honor, as Wong&apos;s father is morally against drunken boxing, and hates it when his reputation is damaged even a little. The acting involved with the tension amongst Chan and his family is at times a bit overblown, but for the most part gets the job right.\n\nJackie Chan is one of the few actors/actresses in modern cinema history that can both be taken seriously and lightly. We see Chan at his playful side, especially when he is drunk. But, take away the smile, watch him pose, and you will fear him. Seeing that look in his eye right before a major fight starts can send shivers down your spine, as you know he will not back down easy, and will use whatever technique necessary to take you out. His physical appearance isn&apos;t exactly intimidating, but his agility and amazing ability to be balanced and whip out an insane combo of punches and kicks remains to be matched by anyone else out there. The best of Chan is here in terms of acting, usage of props, and kung fu. Don&apos;t let his usage of props fool you, he can engage in a brutal victory without the use of any objects. Few Jackie Chan films prove this, but Drunken Master has its share of fights without any other objects floating around.\n\nThe fights are what Chan is best known for, and the fights are where the film excels towards jaw-dropping levels. From the first fight, involving swords and extending from underneath a train to a nearby house, to the final fight that lasts over 10 minutes without exaggeration; Drunken Master will wow you, will keep you on the edge of your seat, and will make you almost jump back in amazement. Hollywood does not have enough patience to spend four months on one fight alone, which is why we don&apos;t see fights in action films like the ones seen here. The final fight, involving a well-trained kicker and Chan at his drunkest stage is easily one of the best fights in historyit&apos;s so well choreographed, so well-timed, and so brilliantly executed, that it deserves a spot on one of modern film&apos;s greatest achievements. Raising the bar for generations to come, the last fight mixes speed, agility, humor, combos, fast movements, and unbelievable stunts. In truth, all the clashes prior do the same, but this one puts all the others to shame.\n\nBottom Line: Missing this film would be a travesty, especially if you enjoy a good martial arts film. This time its not Chan alone that makes the film; we have a good cast of characters and fighters, a decent plot, and never really drifts into an unbelievable level unlike most action movies of today. This is Chan at his absolute best; and this is famed director Chia-Liang Liu at his best. Almost a complete package in terms of quality and substance, Legend of Drunken Master is as close as you can get to martial arts perfection; and remains the greatest martial arts film of all-time.",

      "reviewBody": "In the late 1960&apos;sm Withnail and our narrator are two unemployed actors who have little chance of being employed.  Fed up with their lot in Camden, they flee for a restful break in Penrith in the cottage of Withnail&apos;s Uncle Monty.  However the facilities, the oddball locals and the advances of Monty put their friendship under pressure.\n\nThere is very little I can add to the many reviews that have rightly praised this film as one of the funniest British films ever.  The basic plot is not enough to keep you watching and you should not come to this film looking for an amazing narrative - I have watched this several times and never once has it mattered where the film was going, only how it goes there.  The joy of the film is a script that is rich in highly memorable and quotable dialogue that will make you laugh out loud.  It is crass to let this become a list of lines but if you stood up in certain circles and declared `I demand booze&apos; or `I want something&apos;s flesh&apos; then it would immediately be recognised!\n\nOf course, the dialogue would not work if it were delivered badly, a problem that does not exist here.  Grant is, and always will be, Withnail; no matter how many stupid adverts he does for shops this is how I will remember him. His delivery is tremendous and he brings the character to life in a spinning fireball of comedic excess!  McGann has the less showy part but is equally as good and has to make his character real in order to hold the film together.  Support roles are just as well scripted and just as funny - notably Griffiths (you terrible c*nt!) and the late Michael Elphick.\n\nOverall this is simply one of the best British comedies ever made and it breaks my heart to see voter&apos;s lists where things like Four Weddings top it! The delivery is great and the writing is consistently outrageous and hilarious.  The only downside of this film is  that director/writer Robinson has never topped this wonderful movie and looks like he never will."

      "reviewBody": "`Far From Heaven&apos; is a total artistic triumph for writer/director Todd Haynes, who has, among other things, provided the most brilliant examination of the codes and values of the 1950&apos;s that I have ever seen in a film. His work here turns out to be a uniquely exciting and satisfying blend of form and content.   The &apos;50&apos;s were, of course, a time when `normality&apos; was the condition most honored and prized in American society.  To be just like everyone else was not merely the greatest goal to which one could aspire, but it came to define the very value one had as a human being.  And woe to anyone who didn&apos;t quite fit into those proscribed limits of `acceptability&apos; - for if one didn&apos;t, one had to at least keep up the appearance of respectability and conformity for the benefit of society, even if what went on behind closed doors was something quite different from what people on the outside imagined.\n\nThe Whitakers are the model of a perfect &apos;50&apos;s family.  Frank is a handsome, highly successful businessman with a beautiful, well-respected wife, who divides her time between raising their two children, maintaining their lovely suburban home, and spearheading the requisite number of charities for a woman in her position.  In fact, she is such an archetype of the ideal housewife that a local society paper has chosen to feature her as one of their profiles.  Cathy&apos;s perfect life, however, is quickly shattered when she makes the shocking discovery that the husband she loves so dearly is a closeted homosexual, who obviously married her as a means of hiding the truth from both the world and himself.  In true &apos;50&apos;s fashion, Frank, when Cathy catches him in the act with another man, decides to seek `treatment&apos; from a therapist, in the vain hope that he will be `cured&apos; of his `problem.&apos; These scenes are a jolting and stark reminder of just how far we&apos;ve come from the days when this unenlightened viewpoint held sway in society. The film also deals with the issue of racism, when Cathy becomes a confidante and friend of a young black man who works as her gardener.  When this relationship is noticed by the townspeople, the ugly realities of bigotry and prejudice come to the fore, proving that, even in a place like Connecticut, where no actual laws segregated blacks from whites, the attitudes of the common citizenry were no more enlightened than those that permeated the Deep South.\n\nIn a stroke of genius, Haynes has patterned his film after actual 1950&apos;s melodramas, particularly those by director Douglas Sirk, whose movies like `Imitation of Life&apos; and `Magnificent Obsession&apos; provided daring (for the times) studies of social issues like racism and May/December romances within the context of what were, essentially, glossy, visually palatable soap operas.  Sirk&apos;s films are often honored for their ability to inject subtly subversive sentiments into popular, mainstream entertainments.  `Far From Heaven&apos; looks exactly like those films, from the color-splashed autumnal setting to the picture-perfect interiors of an upper-middle class home in suburban New England where familial and personal problems appear as out of place as `Leave it to Beaver&apos; would seem if it were on network TV today. The astounding achievement here is that Haynes is both paying homage to and utterly destroying the period at the same time.  He succeeds in immersing the audience for nearly two hours in this amazingly recreated world.  We come to feel as trapped in the stifling setting as the characters themselves do.   Haynes captures with emotional force the sense of helplessness these characters feel at not being able to `measure up&apos; to the demands of their world and the utter sadness and loneliness caused by the fact that they don&apos;t even have anyone they can truly open up to and discuss their problems with, for they become instant candidates for rumor-mongering and societal rejection the moment they do.  `Keeping up appearances&apos; becomes the sole consideration in such circumstances, leading many people to lead lives of quiet desperation, hidden behind blandly conformist, upbeat exteriors. In our day and age, when people have gone to the other extreme - pouring out their every twisted idiosyncrasy on daytime TV talk shows for the benefit of a sensation-craving audience - it&apos;s important to be reminded of how much worse the alternative can be.  If nothing else, `Far From Heaven&apos; is a study of the kind of emotional and psychological damage that can be inflicted on an individual when a society encourages repression and conformity at all costs.\n\nAs Cathy, Julianne Moore gives a performance that can be called nothing less than overwhelming.  She is utterly heartbreaking as a good-natured woman, totally baffled by the curves life is throwing at her, trying to maintain a façade of normalcy and happiness even though inside her psyche has been inexplicably and irrevocably torn to pieces.  She wants desperately to figure out where her husband is coming from, but the distance he keeps putting between himself and her precludes any such understanding.  Yet Cathy is also a paradoxical figure in that, even though she is struggling to keep her life and marriage appearing `normal&apos; to the outside world, she is subtly undercutting that goal by challenging the status quo in her relationship with Raymond, the gardener.  Her genuine revulsion at the racist attitudes she sees around her compels her to act in a way true to her own convictions. Moore does a perfect job conveying every facet of this richly detailed and complex character.  It is certainly award-worthy work from one of our very finest actresses.  As Frank, Dennis Quaid, in a controlled, restrained and heart-wrenching performance, captures the sadness of a man who wants desperately to live the life he&apos;s chosen but who just can no longer fight against the truth of his own nature.   In a way, Cathy and Frank&apos;s situations are mirror images of one another.  Both discover a `love&apos; on the outside of societal norms, yet, because of the personal pain that that love is inflicting on the other partner in the marriage (his for another man and hers for another man, as well), the two hurting people seem unable to perceive that connection they share.  These two fine performers turn what might have been just a cold exercise in style into a deeply moving and profoundly meaningful work\n\nTechnically, the film is a masterpiece on every level, from its art direction to its costume design to its cinematography.  The veteran composer Elmer Bernstein has provided a richly evocative symphonic score, modeled on actual &apos;50&apos;s style soundtracks, that brings out the melodramatic richness of the film&apos;s many set pieces.  Yet, his work here also has a quieter quality, particularly in the subtle piano riff, which reminds us quite a bit of his classic score for `To Kill a Mockingbird.&apos; As a director, Haynes shows himself in total control of his medium, blending all these elements into a complete and satisfying whole.\n\n`Far From Heaven&apos; is really unlike any movie you have ever seen, a fascinating admixture of the old and the modern.  It also happens to be one of the very best films of 2002, a true work of art."

Sanjay Leela Bhansali has perfectly altered some parts of novel to suit the film.The movie continuously keeps on drooping till it ends.Its a perfect anticlimax kind of movie. \n\nBrief Story: Initial part of first half of the film shows immense bonding between childhood playmates Devdas(Shahrukh Khan) and Paro(Aishwarya Rai) and the reactions of all other characters to there relationship.Later part of the first half shows how circumstances result in the separation of these 2 lovers. Second Half shows the impact of separation which drives Devdas to stunning courtesan Chandramukhi(Madhuri Dixit).Devdas drains himself into excessive drinking in an attempt to get Paro out of his mind and also to prevent Chandramukhi from entering into his mind.Ultimately Devdas drinks himself to death, loosing both women.(One whom he could never stop loving and One whom he could never love).\n\nSalient Features of the movie : 1)Combining three biggest stars and extracting there acting to maximum possible extent by unbelievably talented filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali. 2)The film perfectly depicts its timeline(Pre Independence Era)through its strikingly attractive and huge sets,through richness of costumes etc. 3)Another striking feature is the dialogues.One hardly finds these kind of precise and sentimental dialogues in present day Bollywood films.\n\nIf you really want to know what a tragedy is ,then Devdas is best the example!! Just go for it !!",

Sure, the psychic connection between Jamie and Michael is a little goofy, ill-explained, beyond the scope of a Halloween movie, and exists for no real reason, and yes, other people wearing a mask similar to Michael and pretending to be Michael is getting old (not to mention predictable.)  The mask doesn&apos;t resemble any of the previous masks really, the Myers house had an inexplicable make-over . . . I could keep these complaints rolling for some time (don&apos;t even get me started on the man in black), but despite all my reasons to not like this film . . . I prefer it over #4.\n\nI found Halloween 5 to be strangely fun, which horror tends to be when you stop caring for the cast.  While I like Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasance in the leads, most of the supporting characters I didn&apos;t really like at all, so when Myers starts the party rolling I&apos;m rooting for team Thorn.  And this time around, Miky proves he has a dark sense of humor.  I especially like his choice in masks in Halloween 5 . . . \n\nBut is it scary?  No, but there are a few genuine intense moments towards the end as Michael inevitably runs out of victims and closes in on the stars.  I liked all the chases involving Danielle Harris and confrontations between Donald Pleasence and evil personified . . . even if said confrontations are on the silly side.\n\nSpeaking of Harris, despite her character not being able to talk in the script, she manages to rise far above the material and actually pull it off. Or in other words, while her character was written by a hack and sloppily thrown together, she works wonders with the very little she&apos;s given.  It makes me really wish she got writing worthy of her performance, but like a professional, she makes the best of it . . . and to think the studio wouldn&apos;t let her reprise her role after this?  A slap to the face after an insult . . . oy.\n\nI remember reading on the VHS box of Halloween 5 the exclamation, `Michael finally unmasked!&apos;  And couldn&apos;t help but chuckle as I recalled him being mask-less at least once in every Myers-inclusive Halloween until this film. Granted, this is the first time he, himself, takes it off.  Oh well. \n\n As for the film&apos;s ending, I can&apos;t forgive because it lead to the atrocity known as Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers which felt Halloween 5 was extremely flawed but still fun . . . so it set out to make a sequel that was all flaw and no fun . . . or something."

But it does have some parallels, and except for the Judd Neldon character (rather annoying) it is realistic and comedic in some aspects.\n\nDemi Moore as Jules is simply lost in denial borrowing money to keep up an image of success. They are 26 years old and have no clue what is in store. Andrew McCarthy likable and sympathetic. Ally Sheedy, just okay. Rob Lowe is very good as irresponsible Billy, involved with Mare Winningham, the resident unattractive &apos;old standby&apos; girlfriend.\n\nThere are some scenes reminiscent of a frat party. A few scenes with Emilio Estevez, pursuing a pipe-dream romance with Andie McDowell. Basically it addresses recent graduates floundering, attempting different careers and lifestyles, affairs and obsessions. It catches that time period most of us had, when we thought we were so significant in the world, not yet jaded, still trying to find meaning and hope. The Winningham character particularly conveys the aspect of the screenplay. When her father (Martin Balsam) tells her to just get married settle down and have a greeting card franchise (like the rest of her family) No I am committed to my real job, she says as she works as a social worker, still trying to have an affect.\n\nSimilar to the later Generation X issues, and the now sense of alienation, everyone goes through similar growing pains, whether 80&apos;s materialism, 90&apos;s nihilism (&apos;Reality Bites&apos;) or today&apos;s general alienation and violence. The issues are the same, the culture just manifests them a bit differently. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Mongol (2007), was co-written and directed by Sergei Bodrov. It was filmed in Kazakhstan, and is in Mongolian with English subtitles. It&apos;s a biography of Ghenghis Khan, especially his rise to power. The movie quotes an old proverb: &quot;Do not scorn a weak cub; he may become a brutal tiger.&quot; Actually, as portrayed in the film, Ghenghis Khan was hardly a weak cub, even as a young child. However, he certainly became a tiger when grown--whether brutal or just powerful is another question.\n\nThe film is more or less consistent with the Wikipedia report of Khan&apos;s life. He was captured and enslaved as a boy, but managed to escape and eventually conquer his local tribal enemies. (The movie portrays Ghenghis Khan as a young boy and then a young man. The film ends before we can see Khan&apos;s eventual consolidation of his huge empire.)\n\nThere is (literally) a cast of thousands. The movie is colorful, the battle scenes are graphic, and men, women, and horses all look great. The acting was excellent, especially that of Odnyam Odsuren as the young Ghenghis Khan, Tadanobu Asano as the grown man, and the beautiful Khulan Chuluun as Börte, his wife.\n\nFor political and/or esthetic reasons, Khan is portrayed as a man who brought the warring Mongolian tribes together, and as a lawgiver and just ruler. I don&apos;t have enough knowledge of the period to know whether the people of his empire would have taken this view. However, this is a movie, not a Ph.D. dissertation, so I accepted it as an action-filled and enjoyable--if not profound--film.\n\nWe saw this film at the excellent Rochester High Falls International Film Festival. Because of the sweeping nature of the battles, and the glorious shots of the landscape, this movie will lose a lot on DVD. Try to see it in a theater, preferably one with a large screen.",

There&apos;s literally a guy with a bucket of blood throwing it over the mountain in a blink and miss scene, you&apos;ll need to watch it in slow motion.\n\nIt was made without a script, just his friends helping out and Peter Jackson using the power of his awesome imagination.

To sum it up, it is a good movie.\n\nStill, I cannot say I will ever want to watch it again or that I enjoyed it that much in the first place. The reason for that (my incredibly subjective reason) is that there is nothing that revealing. The issues raised in the movie (loneliness, social media addiction, its shallowness, and the users&apos; search for that shallowness and faux perfection) are all &quot;right&quot;, they are all serious problems able to ruin lives or at least distort your view of life. However, most of us clearly understand it, and thus the plot was perfectly predictable because it&apos;s a mirror of the current situation in the world - how can it not be predictable? \n\nSumming it up, despite all the highs of the movie, to me, it looked like a high schooler&apos;s moralistic essay: all the right thoughts, all the right intentions, but far from being as non-conformist or groundbreaking and revealing as the author believes.",

When he is arrested for fraud, he is sentenced to three years in prison and his assets are frozen by the justice. However, his crooked lawyer Lew Popper (M. Emmet Walsh) negotiates a six month freedom, and the weak Stan, who is afraid of being raped in prison, hires the specialist in martial arts The Master (David Carradine) to teach him self-defense. Six months later, Big Stan is sent to the Oaksburgh State Penitentiary totally confident in his expertise in martial arts. He challenges the violent leaders of the gangs and defeats them, being respected by the inmates and bringing peace in the patio. However, the dirty Warden Gasque (Scott Wilson) has the intention of transforming the penitentiary in a luxury resort, and uses Big Stan knowledge to improve his project, promising to release him sooner using the corrupt penal system.\n\nI have been a big fan of Rob Schneider since &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot; and I am never disappointed with his funny movies. &quot;Big Stan&quot; is no exception, and this tribute to &quot;Prison Break&quot; and &quot;Kung Fu&quot; is another hilarious entertainment of this great comedian. I laughed a lot with his jokes and situations and I really recommend this comedy for those days that the viewer is down or worried with something to relax and relief the tension, or seeking an amusing and light entertainment. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Big Stan  Arrebentando na Prisão&quot; (&quot;Big Stan  Blowing Away in the Prison&quot;)",

The previews made this movie look like a high powered suspense thriller, but I was weary about the plot and I was suspecting a thousand different plot holes. But, I was wrong. This movie is executed wonderfully. Yes, there are the usual thriller cliches, but once you get past all that, this movie is really entertaining. The acting is not all that bad either. Judd is great and Freeman is perfect as always (the only thing about him is that I am still a little hazy as to the gold earring that he totes on his right ear). The supporting cast includes Jim Caviezel, Adam Scott, the very hott Amanda Peet, Bruce Davison and Tom Bower. All of whom do an exceptional job.\n\nThis may look like just another one of those &apos;trial&apos; movies, but this isn&apos;t. It is actually quite good if you just look past the typical plot and watch it. Other recommendations include A FEW GOOD MEN and RULES OF ENGAGEMENT. They are both a little different, but still go along the same lines.\n\n This film is for people who appreciate good, old-fashioned suspense thrillers. These kind of movies are the kind people need to show us that looks can be deceiving and that people are not always what they appear to be.\n\nHIGH CRIMES: 5/5."

The only things that can make an action film decent are not too many corny scenes and some comedic elements. Take for instance Cradle 2 the Grave, which I saw a couple of weeks back. Now the action was pretty OK, there were some funny elements, but there were some stupid things as well (such as a corny ending). Or Bulletproof Monk, which was a bit corny overall. While A Man Apart is certainly not a good film, it is one of the better old school&apos; action films I&apos;ve seen lately. The acting is decent, there are no corny elements and there is a good mix of emotion / softness and action. The film might not be suited for the big screen, but it does well as a rental (BTW: the film was shot between 2000 and 2001 and got shelved at first). The film certainly has some interesting elements and is better than most of Seagal&apos;s or Van Damme&apos;s new films. I was not disappointed to have rented it.\n\n 6,75 out of 10",

      "reviewBody": "As I said in my review of the first installment of this line: Steve Martin has walked in the Valley of the Kings. He has faced some pretty amazing obstacles, and he has stood in some pretty big shadows. Let&apos;s face it. Although his rendition of, &quot;The Out-of-Towners,&quot; was amusing, he&apos;s no Jack Lemmon. While I LOVE his Sgt. Bilko portrayal, he&apos;s not Phil Silvers. Cheaper by the Dozen wasn&apos;t horrible, but he&apos;s not Clifton Webb, either. He&apos;s Steve Martin.\n\nYou may not appreciate his style of comedy, but the Peter Sellers-venerated character of Inspector Jacques Clouseau made for the best use of Martin&apos;s prolific use of pratfalls, ironic wit, and in your face sarcasm than any other character he has tackled previously.\n\nBut the character portrayed by Martin herein has something I never saw in Sellers&apos; portrayal after the second installment...genuine heart. This is sweetly honest in its attempt. I feel that this will actually turn into a legitimate franchise reboot, if the average movie-goer will stop attempting to compare Martin&apos;s Clouseau to Sellers&apos; Clouseau. They are two different actors, and Martin has stated to the point of nausea that he is NOT attempting to &quot;do&quot; Sellers&apos; interpretation of the character! \n\nAs far as the MOVIE goes, it is sweet, funny, and enduring with a strong story, a stronger relationship element, and a great cast. I did not miss Kevin Kline nearly as much as I supposed I would. John Cleese was a perfect Dreyfus, showing us the beginnings of Herbert Lom&apos;s trademark twitch, when dealing with Clouseau. Very nice! \n\nI think, when looking back, Steve Martin&apos;s Jacques Clouseau will be remembered fondly by the new generations, just as prior generations stubbornly cling to Sellers&apos; character in spite of Martin&apos;s superior portrayal.\n\nAll in all? I love it. It is a(n almost) violence-free, blood-free, honest attempt at a family film. This is great! and I cannot wait to get it into my collection.\n\nIt rates an 8.4/10 from...\n\nthe Fiend :.",

      "reviewBody": "Although Platoon may have gotten more acclaim, by far the best film on the Vietnam War is this one. Casualties Of War is going to leave Platoon way in the dust when history has its verdict.\n\nThough Sean Penn&apos;s got several great films to his credit, by far this is the best work of Michael J. Fox on the big screen. His soldier with a conscious who can&apos;t live with himself after witnessing an act of barbarity that the other men of his squad commit should have brought him an Oscar nomination. In fact there could have and should have been a few of them for this film. \n\nFox plays a young soldier only a few weeks in Vietnam. On patrol Sergeant Sean Penn saves his life, but then on a second patrol because Penn and friends could not get leave to bleed the lizard as they say, they kidnap a young Vietnamese woman and take her on patrol. All the men on the patrol, Penn, Don Harvey, John C. Reilly, and John Leguizamo all gang rape the girl, but Fox refuses. Later on he&apos;s got a crisis of conscience.\n\nKids who grew up on World War II movies and westerns with clearly defined good and bad guys were ill prepared for a war in Vietnam. So was our government which had been involved in more or less degree since the end of World War II and the breakup of French Indochina. The subtleties of the regional politics eluded our policy makers in Washington. It was mighty hard to tell who was a friend and who was an enemy. You treated anyone with a yellowish pigmentation and slanted eyes as an enemy, the only friends you knew were the ones wearing the same green jungle fatigues as you were.\n\nThe war twisted Penn and Harvey. Leguizamo and Reilly were essentially followers, only Fox who hadn&apos;t been there long enough to have his sense of morality impaired could see this was all wrong. That&apos;s the frightening part of Casualties Of War. None of the four could see anything wrong, even Leguizamo who sees his first duty as to stick with the guys who have your back in the field.\n\nAs good as Fox and Penn and the rest of the Occidental cast is, the best performance in the film is Thuy Thu Lee. As the bewildered and frightened young girl she will positively break your heart with her one and only film performance.\n\nCasualties Of War was shot in Thailand so we&apos;re seeing actual Southeast Asia locations. Brian DePalma&apos;s direction of his stellar cast is right on target. Don&apos;t ever miss Casualties Of War about the ultimate Vietnam experience.",

      "reviewBody": "Waitress could have turned into a middling mess, or something with characters that are hard to like (or, I should really note, sociopathic) if done in a more hard-lined Hollywood &apos;rom-com&apos; assembly-line output (in 2007 those were still done). But Adrienne Shelley was more, for lack of a less precise word-choice, sweet-hearted about her characters. Even the villain of the story, and he is a villain who stands firmly in the way of our hero Keri Russell, her character&apos;s husband played by Jeremy Sisto, takes a break (if only in the tiniest moments) to not be a scumbag and show how he too can be vulnerable and afraid.\n\nHe surely shows his humanity the least - Sisto is scarily adept at making his Earl into a presence that&apos;s felt off camera too, if not more so - but Shelley had with Waitress a real chance to make a commercial picture and she took it. Prior to this she directed a couple of low budget independent films, and with this may have seemed to go &apos;mainstream&apos;. The casting choices though are what count here especially; Russell carries so much screen presence that it&apos;s a wonder the lens doesn&apos;t make out with her before Nathan Fillion&apos;s Doctor does. And in small parts she gets things right too with Cheryl Hines as another waitress at the diner where Jenna serves and (especially, well, uniquely) makes pies, and Andy Griffith is the nice-but-demeaning water (he better get his two waters AND have time to read the horoscope!)\n\nThere are times when the movie goes into perhaps being too &apos;cute&apos; or &apos;quirky&apos;; this is from the same studio, Fox Searchlight, that would a few months later put out another story of an uncertain-in-her-life young woman, Juno, and there&apos;s points this dips into being a story that is so light it might float away (or another way to put it on the other extreme is that it&apos;s a more grounded version of Pushing Daisies). And oddly enough if there&apos;s one part of the movie that doesn&apos;t work for me it&apos;s ironically Shelley&apos;s own sub-plot, where she&apos;s another waitress courted by a stone-cold Nebbish with a capital N, and who have an argument in the diner which kind of grinds the movie to a halt.\n\nBut I can forgive (most of) that for how pure the relationship is between Russell and Fillion on screen; I wish I saw more of Nathan FIllion in movies, or at least in leads like this where he gets to develop a character and he shows us just enough to get to understand why he&apos;s doing the things he is. Or, on the reverse, not entirely know why, again this is from Jenna&apos;s point of view and that&apos;s crucial - we&apos;re seeing it through HER eyes, through the downtrodden hero we want to see get out of her loveless marriage. Though some parts are funny (scattered really), it&apos;s actually more of a drama with a light touch, and it feels harrowing at times in the scope of a low-middle class, blue collar existence: what does one do with the options presented, i.e. bad marriage, a baby on the way that may/may not be loved, and an affair that is hot but untenable?\n\nRussell guides all of these conflicts of the character beautifully, leading up to a conclusion that is genuine and moving. To a further point, knowing about the horrible circumstances outside of the production - Shelley was murdered just before the film was released, though it was finished at the time - makes the very ending a real lump-in-the-throat moment (or just cry your eyes out, go for it). Waitress wears its emotions on its sleeve, but it carries its sincerity along both in the writing and performances, so it&apos;s a tough film to ever put down all that much.",

      "reviewBody": "A bizarre, enigmatic and brave cinematic return to feature film making from Leos Carax, after a 13 year gap, Holy Motors is a self-consciously low budget odyssey of ambiguous, pseudo-linear intentions. After five years attempting to raise funds for a large budget English language film that ultimately fell through, Carax turned his attentions on a native language film with a smaller cost, and was inspired when observing the many limousines driving around Paris. Regular collaborator Denis Lavant plays the mysterious Monsiuer Oscar, who is driven around the city in the white stretched vehicle, taking him to the variety of &quot;appointments&quot; of the day. The appointments appear to be a series of acting jobs, where Mr Oscar dresses up for the multitude of roles.\n\nFrom a dishevelled gypsy woman, - through a banker, and a dying millionaire - to a crazed vagabond who kidnaps a fashion model, Kay M. (Eva Mendes), Oscar glides through the day and into the night, changing his appearance with make-up and prosthetics, fulfilling his duty to a mysterious company, accomplishing the jobs he is given information through files in the back of the car. In other scenarios Oscar is dressed in a black leotard with white dots, as he enters a very industrialised building where he performs a motion-capture dance and highly sexualised duo with a red-clad blond woman, as it turns into the serpentine CGI creation; in another, Oscar joins his 2 point 4 family unit, which consist of chimpanzees.\n\nWhilst Carax takes many stylistic references from David Lynch, the film also offers a quite unique sense of humour. In one scene, Oscar is playing a dying rich man, who has his step-niece beside him in his last moments. After dying, Oscar climbs from the bed, the niece still sobbing into the covers, he turns back to ask the girls name, and offering apologies for his swift exit: &quot;I have to get to another appointment&quot; he states, which is returned with the reply that she also needs to leave for another appointment (It&apos;s funnier on screen than in writing - and certainly after the incredibly moving moments of death). It&apos;s a jarring punch-line to a heartfelt moment. Small details of technological modernity invade the mis-en-scene, for example, when Oscar is the vagabond, he wildly runs through a cemetery eating flowers, each gravestone has its own www.address.\n\nHoly Motors is without question a film about film, and film making, offering allusions to Jean Cocteau and Jean-Luc Godard. Fundamentally though, this film seems to evoke another French original, Georges Franju, whose film Eyes Without a Face (1960) is highly referenced. Edith Scob (who played the masked victim in the film), drives Mr Oscar around, and actually reprises her role, and hides her face once again under the mask. The mysterious events in the film could also be regarded as a comment on changing nature of cinematic production. From the motion capture sequence to the nature of Oscar scatological &quot;job&quot;, the film seems to lament the loss of real cinema - Carax filmed in digital video (a format that he hates) for budgetary reasons.\n\nWhat is so beautiful about this mode of cinema is the complexity of meaning. This is film so dense in symbolism that it requires repeat viewings. Whether it&apos;s about the changing face of cinema, the acting profession, or an exploration of the nature of identity (Oscar could represent the many faces that we have to put on each day, in the performance of life, and our increasing need to compartmentalise each element of our lives), it doesn&apos;t really matter what the directors true intentions were. This is cinematic experience at a most cerebral level. We are not given the meaning, but we take from it what we bring to it, and can interpret it how we want. Lavant creates a fantastic, multi- faceted performance, even managing to hold an erect penis in the most unsexy environment ever. Kylie Minogue even manges to be perfectly suited for her small role in which she may have been a past lover of Mr Oscar, she also sings a song written by Carax and Neil Hannon, which enlightens a dingy musical movie moment.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

      "name": "Engaging psychological drama with Ludivine Sagnier and Charlotte Rampling",
      "reviewBody": "Released in 2003, &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; is a drama/psychological thriller about a popular English novelist named, Sarah (Charlotte Rampling), who vacations at her publisher&apos;s villa in France to find inspiration for her next book. Unfortunately, the publisher&apos;s oversexed daughter, Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), visits and disrupts her activities.\n\nIf you remember 70s&apos; films like &quot;Orca&quot; and &quot;Zardoz&quot; you&apos;ll know that Rampling was stunning in her physical prime in a looks-that-kill way. In &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; she&apos;s still in decent shape for a woman verging on 60, but her character&apos;s a joyless biyatch desperately seeking inspiration. Julie, by contrast, is young, friendly and overflowing with sexuality, but – like Sarah – she&apos;s not a pushover in the least.\n\nSagnier shines as the wild child French hottie. There&apos;s just something about the female French accent that&apos;s a turn-on. Despite her sexiness, it&apos;s clear in some scenes that Julie&apos;s actually sort of plain in a girl-next-door kind of way. It&apos;s what she does with what she&apos;s got that makes her stunning.\n\nLike 2005&apos;s &quot;Match Point,&quot; &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; is the antithesis of the modern &apos;blockbuster&apos; and all its moronic trappings -- there&apos;s no quick editing, no CGI, no goofy one-liners, no explosions and no promise of $400 million at the box office. No, &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; is movie-making based simply on excellent writing and cinematic storytelling. The end is a revelation to the viewer even if you were expecting it, particularly because, if you research it, it&apos;s way more than even that, believe it or not. It&apos;s amazing how good writing &amp; storytelling can create a &apos;Wow&apos; reaction more so than the most elaborate overkill action sequence with all its requisite CGI and explosions.\n\nThe film runs 102 minutes and was shot in Luberon, Vaucluse, France, and London.\n\nGRADE: A- \n\n***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don&apos;t read further if you haven&apos;t seen the film) \n\nThe obvious interpretation is that Julie isn&apos;t real, but rather a character created by Sarah for her next book whereas Julia is the publisher&apos;s real daughter, revealed at the end. People who draw this conclusion, like me on my first two viewings, are on the right track, but this interpretation is only accurate to a point. For details see the thread on the IMDb message board &quot;The Definitive Answer / Color-Key to Swimming Pool.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "STARRED UP is another modern-day prison flick, this time a British one. Before everybody starts groaning and thinking &quot;what, again?!&quot;, let me reassure you that this one&apos;s not sugar-coated at all. There&apos;s no sentiment here, just brutality throughout, and yet it becomes an immersive and thought-provoking experience. Even with all the violence and bad language and animalistic behaviour, there is still light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThe film features Jack O&apos;Connell (&apos;71) in a star-making performance as a disturbed young man who has just been transferred (aka starred up) to men&apos;s prison from juvenile. To complicate things further, his own father is an inmate, and the two have a volatile relationship. I&apos;ve seen the Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn before in a few Hollywood flicks and didn&apos;t think much of him, but he&apos;s a perfect fit for the part here.\n\nA lot of the usual prison clichés are played out here, but they happen in a matter-of-fact and dare I say it grimly realistic way. The violence is brutal but not overdone, and it does serve a purpose rather than being gratuitous. And the realism is top-notch, reminding me of the BRONSON film at times. Despite all this writer Jonathan Asser manages to tell a believable storyline with an identifiable beginning, middle, and end. It&apos;s a good little film, although not for all tastes given the subject matter.",

I mentioned the book in a university tutorial for my course on literary satire, and no one would believe me that it was not trash because they could not separate it from the movie which followed it. Too bad - the book is good enough to have warranted a script that stays true to the original story rather than exchange wit and sophistication for extended dance sequences and the lubricatory possibilities of yogurt."

      "name": "Romero&apos;s Return To His Roots",
      "reviewBody": "George A. Romero is one of those filmmakers who shouldn&apos;t need an introduction. If you&apos;re a horror fan at all, you should be intimately familiar with his Dead series by now, and if you&apos;re a movie fan at all, you should at least know Night Of The Living Dead and Dawn Of The Dead, the first and still the strongest entries in the genre. It&apos;s no hyperbole to say that Romero essentially invented the zombie movie, gave it the structures and tones that have relentlessly followed the genre through 40 years of movie history.\n\nDiary Of The Dead, Romero&apos;s new movie and latest entry into the 5-part series, is a return to the form and feel of his original classic Night Of The Living Dead. The three movies in between (the classic Dawn, hit-or-miss Day and severely underrated Land) showed a world consumed by destruction and fear, already well past the point of no return in an unthinkable apocalypse. Diary takes us back to the beginning, taking place during the first few days of the attacks, documenting how a group of college students (and one drunken professor) cope with the crisis growing around them.\n\nThe hook of the movie is that what we&apos;re seeing is not presented in a typical film fashion, but instead as a series of homemade video clips made by the characters themselves. While shooting their own low-budget horror movie, the students are interrupted by the sudden, jarring realization that freshly dead bodies are coming back to life and attacking people. What follows is a documentation of their quick departure from their suddenly deserted campus and their long trip to home, safety and any sort of an answer.\n\nIf the plot description has you thinking of The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield, the comparison ends with the initial conceit of horror via home movies. There&apos;s no shaky-cam addled suspense here, and you won&apos;t ever feel motion sick. The camera&apos;s presence in the movie serves to give a heightened feeling of suspense and immediacy. Unlike most other zombie movies, there&apos;s no outside camera telling the story, letting us know where the zombies are and when they&apos;re coming. We follow the characters through the movie, and the threat of danger is always palpable, even when nothing on screen is particularly frightening. Hitchcock once said that surprise was a bomb going off under a table unexpectedly, while suspense was letting the audience know there is a bomb under the table while the characters remain unaware. Diary is a movie with thousands of bombs waiting under thousands of tables, waiting to explode every time the camera turns a new corner.\n\nAfter Land Of The Dead, a great movie that felt buried beneath a huge budget and massive studio interference, it&apos;s great to see Romero returning to his indie roots. Diary is entirely his own movie, and he gets the tone perfect. The campy scares and the gross-out gore explosions are all present, and will delight fan boys to no end. (They sure got some big laughs out of me.) But what Romero does best is suddenly switch from fun to disturbing when you least expect it. The best moments of Diary come when the gory thrill ride comes screeching to a halt and everything suddenly becomes all too relatable, entirely too real. These are the moments that will stick with you after the gory brain-splatter effects have lost their novelty.\n\nDiary isn&apos;t quite a perfect movie though. Occasionally the hand-held camera device becomes too distracting and begins to get in the way of the story. The movie takes too much time rationalizing why the characters decide to film the events, rather than trusting the audience to go along with the idea. At times it feels like the movie is apologizing for its own concept, which it definitely does not need to do. We don&apos;t need to know the details of why the movie is edited, or why music has been added. The explanations slow down the movie, and only highlight problems instead of fixing them. Also, the pace slows down quite a bit in the third act, which is when Romero movies usually jolt up to a fevered pitch. Stick it out though, because the movie&apos;s last sequence, and especially its last line of dialog, are worth the price of admission alone. This is most likely not the end of the Dead saga, but if it were, it could not have come to a more perfect conclusion than the jarring, horrific last shot Romero gives us.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a very straightforward movie about PTSD. Do not make the mistake that you are going to watch a comedy! The drama here is imbedded throughout the whole movie. The mental health of veterans. Two former Army Rangers are having a road trip of a lifetime. Briggs (Channing Tatum) and Lulu (a Belgian Malinois) race down the Pacific Coast to get to a fellow soldier&apos;s funeral on time. First time director Channing Tatum is apparently not only a good actor, but in this movie he proofs he can also direct. In this movie his acting is so good that you really start to think he has a brain injury. Despite the fact that the ending is predictable, it is a very good movie. No need to think too much about the story, just a movie you will enjoy. A solid 7/10.",

Despite the lack of budget, Haskins sees the chance to dispute the NCAA and moves with his wife and children to the college dormitory. He recruits seven talented and rejected black players to play with five Caucasian players and formed a legendary team that wined the 1966 national championship against the powerful Kentucky.\n\n&quot;Glory Road&quot; is an engaging film with a great message based on a true story. In a period when the racism was explicit in the USA, Don Haskins challenged many people with his team of black players implementing discipline and training and winning the NCAA against all the odds. The film shows the difficulties and prejudice the players were submitted and how they superseded all the relationship problems proving that they were equal to (or even better than) the white players. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Estrada para a Glória&quot; (&quot;Road to the Glory&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a little surprised at all the negative reviews here. It&apos;s hard to imagine what the reviewers found missing. Romance? Comedy? Or both? Because I found plenty of each. I will say that I can see how you need to be able to relate to the lifestyles depicted to appreciate the film. Because if you can&apos;t, this might as well be about life on Mars.\n\nThis is a smart movie. And the concept is pretty original, considering the difficulty of deviating from the restrictions of the genre. The leads are immensely likable and each able to toss off complex comedic riffs with ease. And I very much enjoyed seeing Adam Scott play the heavy. Not easy to portray a dull-as-donuts bad guy, but he pulled it off.\n\nDespite the &quot;truthiness&quot; of the dialog, the movie does share one thing with all romantic comedies: it&apos;s a wet dream for the love hungry. Especially for those folks who juggle and struggle with the reality of modern relationships. The lead characters wear a veneer of cynical sophistication that many of us use as protective shields. But, as is expected from a rom-com, the veneer cracks. And we&apos;re glad when it does.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but be warned: it is a movie for grown ups.",

Hell no, this is a fun action black comedy which i think a lot of people will enjoy especially if you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino and similar edgy violent thrillers.\n\nKurt Russell is reliably cool as always and i actually thought Costner was pretty badass, i want the jacket he wears for much of the movie. The action is frantic and bloody and i enjoy the overall politically incorrect tone running through the movie. Some scenes are actually really cool and stylish looking.\n\nIt isn&apos;t perfect, there are some really out of place nu metal songs on the soundtrack (there should be way more Elvis songs) and some of the jokes do fall flat.\n\nLooking up some other movies which came out in 2001, is this honestly as bad as trash like Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles or Ghosts Of Mars?\n\nCheck it out, you might be surprised.",

Has Hollywood&apos;s cliché-ed accents eroded your capacity to understand other ones that just happen to be real in the UK ? How d&apos;you think Brits, Aussies and Kiwis cope with &apos;merkan accents then ? Yet US films are the same problem to them ! Come off it, panning a movie just because one is too lazy to make a little effort in concentration ia a wee tad unfair ! &quot;Secret &amp; Lies&quot; is an excellent movie, great acting, and well, Timothy Spall and Brenda Blethyn are good in there because they sound real, because ther accents may not be that smooth to some ears, but they do add credibility to their characters.\n\nBTW, a good few Brit movies on DVD happen to have english subtitles for the hard of hearing, the feature could be a help into getting used to those weird accents 60 million people across the Pond happen to have..."

      "reviewBody": "This movie has been a favorite of mine since i was a kid--i was very into Greek mythology during grade school, so i loved this film, even though i&apos;ve seen it about two dozen times (it continues to be a Sunday-afternoon staple on TV). There are a number of mythological inaccuracies in this film (the Kraken wasn&apos;t a mythological monster; Perseus didn&apos;t have Pegasus, but actually borrowed Hermes&apos; winged sandals, etc.), but it&apos;s still a good kids&apos; introduction to ancient mythology. While the actors playing the &quot;mortals&quot; are definitely inferior to those playing the Gods, i suppose it works in the sense of their being the Olympians&apos; puppets and, well, a little limpness in the thespian department is somewhat de rigeur (as is the wise/comic sidekick of Burgess Meredith and the &apos;little and cute&apos; factor of the mechanical owl) for the kind of classic matinee swashbuckler that &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; is.\n\nBut all these complaints that the Harryhausen effects are crap and it would be so much better done with CGI... well, that&apos;s pure craziness. Sure, the monsters don&apos;t look convincing, but they look a hell of a lot more convincing then they would as cheap computer animation--can you honestly imagine the Medusa sequence being done any better with some cartoon computer program? (Why? So it could look like the crap in &quot;Phantom Menace&quot;?) I&apos;ve always felt that Harryhausen&apos;s stop-motion technique and the resultant odd way in which the monsters moved added to the sense of their mythic status, their unreality, the sense that these are creatures from another world, another plane. (The recent Asian fantasy/action film &quot;Onmyoji&quot; paid tribute to the master by having a CGI demon army move in Harryhausen stop-motion style and damn me if they didn&apos;t look scarier, more unearthly for it.) In my opinion, CGI looks even less &quot;real,&quot; more like a painted-on cartoon. There&apos;s a depth and detail to creatures that have actually been created in the three-dimensional real world that those who have only existed on a computer screen don&apos;t have. Also, no matter how good an actor is, there&apos;s a difference between someone who&apos;s in the same room with the monster he&apos;s fighting, or who at least knows what it looks like, and someone who&apos;s just trying to &quot;act scared&quot; in the general direction where something will be inserted later. (Imagine the &quot;Alien&quot; movies made with a hyped-up animated creature: you know that even motionless and plastic squeezed between light stands, that giant H.R. Geiger monster gave everyone on set the creeps.) Maybe people like CGI because they feel safer with obviously fake monsters, things that never even existed as a three-foot high model next to the ham sandwich in someone&apos;s shop."

      "reviewBody": "Tolkien (3.5 out of 5 stars).\n\nTolkien is a beautifully done biographical drama film about a famous fantasy writer J.R.R. Tolkien who went on to write The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings series. It touched the base when him and his brother lost their mother to some illness. J.R.R. then went to a school where he met a few other teenagers that he did not get along with. Until, eventually they become close friends. There bond grows stronger over the years and they inspire each other to make a difference. He meets Edith (Lily Collins) who he falls in love with. He gets separated when he is drafted into World War 1.\n\nThe plot is pretty decent for a biographical film about J.R.R. Tolkien. The movie was a bit slow in the second act with Tolkien and his fellowship friends talking about stories. It could have been better handled. The plot is inspirational. Tolkien and his friends no matter how often they fight with each other, they will always be brothers. Tolkien and Edith fall deeply in love until they go on different paths. Years later, they come across each other again.\n\nNicholas Hoult is great as Tolkien. Lily Collins was also good as Edith. The music score by Thomas Newman is beautifully done. The direction delivers the eerie tone during the World War 1 scenes. Tolkien suffering from an illness. And trying to find his friends. When they are attacked. He witnesses most of his man killed in combat. Which he feels like he is isolated and he starts seeing visions of dragons out of flamethrowers. Or the aftermath smoke from the explosions looking like a dark lord Sauron. Which he uses his experience to write a fantasy story. While his one focus theme is the journey that everyone goes too and the experiences they face.\n\nOverall, Tolkien is a pretty fair film. The plot is a bit inspirational and emotional with the journey Tolkien experiences. Sadly, the film suffers from an uneven pace in the second act of the movie. The performances and music score is fantastic.",

Even after watching the Mohanlal&apos;s 2021 Malayalam original, I enjoyed this Hindi remake immensely !!\n\nThe story takes off 7 years after the incidents depicted the first installment happen, with Vijay Salgaonkar ( Ajay Devgan) and his family trying to move on with their lives. However the fear of the law catching up with them affects each one of them differently. The police, having lost round 1 haven&apos;t given up hope and are trying every trick in the book to nab Vijay !!\n\nWho wins this cat &amp; mouse game forms the crux of the plot.\n\nThe Hindi remake, like the original has a runtime of 2 hrs 33 mins &amp; around 1 hr 30 mins are pretty laid back with the story proceeding at a leisurely pace. But dont get fooled by this as the movie picks up speed in the last one hour as it moves ahead with one dhamaka after another culminating in a mind-blowing climax.\n\nPerformances by Ajay Devgan and Akshaye Khanna are exceptionally good. Tabu, Shriya Saran , Rajat Kapoor, Kamlesh Sawant and Ishita Dutta too are awesome!!\n\nAn absolutely unmissable movie that remains faithful to the original. It was heartening to see audiences cheer Akshaye &amp; Ajay&apos;s dialogues just like the good old times. Go watch it in the theatres .. you won&apos;t be disappointed for sure!!\n\nGoing with 4 stars out of 5 .. Adios🙂",

Gary Sinese was great too, effectively portraying George.\n\nBut if you really get into the book, the movie doesn&apos;t follow it too faithfully. Curely&apos;s wife is portrayed to be flirty, and a &quot;tart,&quot; when in the book, she was just as lonely as everyone else on the ranch. She wasn&apos;t looking for sex, she was looking for companionship. The screenwriter didn&apos;t interpret the book quite as well as I had hoped.\n\nNow I&apos;m just nitpicking, but when when Lennie pulls the stunt by faking the puppy, it&apos;s just not like him. Lennie is not clever at all, and wouldn&apos;t think to do that.\n\nBut all in all, great movie, definitely great for comparing to the book in a lit. class or anywhere.\n\n8/10",

I&apos;m not convinced there&apos;s enough to be told across a full blown picture, at least not one around 1hr 45mins in length. I will say that Cailee Spaeny puts in a solid display as the titular character, in fairness.\n\nJacob Elordi as Elvis, in my opinion, isn&apos;t a positive to be honest. If I didn&apos;t know he was playing Elvis I genuinely wouldn&apos;t have guessed he was playing the singer, aside from a few outfits and the twisty bit of hair in his fringe. Accent particularly seemed off to me too, Elordi amusingly (given the director&apos;s connection) sounds more like Nicolas Cage (c. 1997, &apos;Con Air&apos;, Cameron Poe) on phone call scenes.\n\nIt&apos;s competently put together visually at least, though overall I can&apos;t honestly say this made a mark on me personally.

      "reviewBody": "Whilst it&apos;s not as good as the original, The Rescuers Down Under is not a disgrace as far as sequels go. Many theatrical sequels tend to be no better than ones released direct-to-video. Down Under is an exception.\n\nPlot-wise, there are a few faults. Some scenes just seemed to be there for the sake of it and the plot is considerably weaker than the original. But there are enough jokes and enough suspense to keep the film going so there&apos;s never a dull moment. Some might say that the story is a rehash of the original and that is partly true. That&apos;s the only real major flaw I find in Down Under.\n\nBenard and Bianca stay wonderfully in character and the new characters, such as Jake the Kangaroo Rat are very memorable too. Penny may have had Teddy for a friend but Cody has Marahute - a mighty Golden Eagle. Her movements are true to that of a real bird of prey, and yet she has a distinct humanoid quality. Whenever you look into her eyes, you know exactly what she&apos;s thinking. Jim Jordan (the voice of Orville) is sadly dead. (God rest his soul). But instead of replacing the voice actor, we have a new albatross - Orville&apos;s brother Wilbur. He is a worthy replacement. He provides plenty of comic relief, especially during his nightmarish time in hospital. Joanna the villain&apos;s sidekick is like Madame Medusa as a lizard. She looks like she came straight out of the original. McLeach, the evil poacher is a very intimidating villain. He&apos;s not as funny as Madame Medusa but he&apos;s not meant to be. He&apos;s not the sort of person you&apos;d like to run into in the wilderness.\n\nIf there&apos;s one aspect of this film that&apos;s superior to the first, it&apos;s the animation. The computer generated shots are spectacular. Sure, they might be dated today, but I think that the hand-drawn animation melds nicely with the CGI. Whilst the jungle in Tarzan looked like plastic, the rocks and cliffs in The Rescuers Down Under look realistic and full of texture. We have a lot of &apos;high-flying in the clouds&apos; scenes which are a lot of fun and would be brilliant on the IMAX screen. Also, putting a tiny mouse against a vast landscape gives the movie an epic feel. Like the first Rescuers, the backgrounds are beautiful and pave the way for the beautiful scenery seen in The Lion King.\n\nHowever, Down Under does have its little flaws. One example is that Cody is Australian yet he speaks with an American accent. Also, how on earth did he climb up that huge cliff? There are other little inconsistencies too but they are easily overlooked.\n\nThe sequel connects nicely with the original. A lot of the RAS mice from the original are seen again. Also, a lot of character designs are true to the first as well. Benard has hardly changed at all. Only Bianca looks somewhat different.\n\nIn conclusion, The Rescuers Down Under is inferior to the original Rescuers, but it&apos;s still high-flying fun. This is definitely one of the better Disney sequels. So sit back and enjoy. Remember, you *could* be watching Pocahontas II.",

      "reviewBody": "Only kidding :) Kung Pow is in a league of its own in terms of calibre. It&apos;s a slapstick &apos;chop socky&apos; martial arts comedy full of silliness and ridiculous dialogue. Its vehicle is that it uses old footage of kung fu films such as Enter the Dragan and overlays its modern content onto them. Plus add intentionally bad dubbing and you have a movie which never for a second tries to be subtle, ingenious, or intelligent.\n\nKung Pow is absolutely, 100% absurdity and it uses this to its fullest extent.\n\nThe plot, if that&apos;s what you&apos;d call it, is a mocking of just about every martial arts classic which has a &apos;wrong fella decides to wreak revenge on the nasty sorts who ruined his life&apos; style story.\n\nSteve Oedekerk is &apos;The Chosen One&apos; whose mission it is to get revenge on the bad folk in as amusing a way as he possibly can. Master Pain is his nemesis and the bad man directly responsible for the unspeakable acts against his family.\n\nThe rest of the movie is purposefully disjointed and has no continuity half the time, but a masterclass in editing is not the point of this exercise. This is simply ridiculous fun, and assuming you switch off your brain completely and wreck any remaining braincells, you will be quite entertained.\n\nAs for how funny it is, well, that&apos;s quite subjective. Many of the gags are clearly forced and milked (No pun intended (You&apos;ll understand that one if you see it)) for all they&apos;re worth. However, many *do* work and provide belly laughs. Sure, you&apos;ll not have tears rolling down your cheeks but if you&apos;re willing to stoop to the dumb level the movie demands of you, you *will* be at least amused.\n\nOne thing the movie makes particularly good use of is special effects, with some more than decent CG animation complimenting a number of scenes. Aside from this, the technical merits of the movie are pretty decent, in that the interpolation of old footage and new footage is actually rather seamless and you&apos;ll not spot it a lot of the time, except where you&apos;re supposed to.\n\nAs The Chosen One, Oedekerk seems to have a great time. It&apos;s a daft movie, so he indulges in stupidity as a matter of cause, and it works reasonably well. It&apos;s always easier to enjoy a film if it appears the actors are enjoying making it.\n\nOverall, leave your brain at the door and do not expect high brow laughs or Jackie Chan style action and you&apos;ll probably get something out of this.",

      "reviewBody": "Every horror series has a black sheep. &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; had the Jason-less fifth installment, &quot;Halloween&quot; the Michael Meyers-less third entry, and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; the silly first sequel. For many fans, &quot;Child&apos;s Play 3&quot; is the embarrassment of the Chucky saga. But why?\n\nSo many reviews of this film express exacerbation, even confusion, over the sudden shift eight years into the future. What&apos;s so hard to understand? We had already had two movies with Chucky chasing a little kid. It was time to move the story along, hence our hero Andy Barclay (Justin Whalin) is now a teenager at a military academy. This change of scenery was the breath of fresh air the series needed, as it opens up all kinds of new options to the murderous doll, which he fully exploits (paintball guns loaded with real ammo, anyone?).\n\nOther reviewers complain this just isn&apos;t scary. There they have a point, but how many gorefests actually bring our hands up to our eyes? Scariness is a great complement, but that doesn&apos;t mean the whole project goes down the tubes without it. &quot;Child&apos;s Play 3&quot; has a smooth storyline, a touch of suspense and a truly memorable, original climax at a carnival (though it doesn&apos;t quite surpass the doll factory finale of the the previous film). Chucky&apos;s foul mouth begins to be a liability rather than an asset, but we can cut him some slack -- he&apos;s certainly never looked better (or more realistic).\n\n&quot;Child&apos;s Play 3&quot; does have its ups and downs, however. The romance between Andy and a fellow cadet is a distraction, and there are times when our plastic star just seems brushed aside in favor of more serious moments. Chucky&apos;s desire to swap souls with someone other than Andy is a welcome change, but his new target, young Tyler, is one dimensional and uninteresting. He&apos;s unable to carry his scenes like Alex Vincent, who played child Andy in the first two films.\n\nAs far as I&apos;m concerned, this was the last of the true &quot;Child&apos;s Play&quot; films. Once this one was done, the series became a shameful, hokey parody of itself. This entry is by no means perfect and it&apos;s certainly not up the caliber of &quot;Child&apos;s Play 2&quot;. Yet it&apos;s not the piece of trash so many would have us believe. In fact, it may just be one of the most underrated theatrical horror films of the early &apos;90s.",

      "reviewBody": "In &quot;One Fine Day&quot; Jack Taylor (George Clooney) and Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) meet when their children miss a school field trip, and after much bickering they finally agree to take shifts in watching their kids.  Over the course of the day they run into countless mishaps and misadventures, and come close together, to understand each other in a sort of non-romantic romantic way.\n\nThe first time I saw &quot;One Fine Day&quot; it was 1996 and I was seven years old. I didn&apos;t like it.  I found it tedious and boring.  Now I&apos;m fourteen, and I just finished watching, and I love it?  I get all the jokes I didn&apos;t get now, all the clever one-liners spoken with a bright, witty confidence that is reminiscent of Frank Capra films.\n\nAnd clever they are!  I have to say, when you subtract a few (very few) somewhat cheesy lines from the script, it becomes perfect.  I&apos;d go as far as to say Oscar worthy.  Yes, you may think its cheesy that Jack&apos;s a famed newspaper columnist bringing down a mob member and the mayor, and Melanie&apos;s an architect working on what we imagine is a multi-million dollar deal with big businessmen, but the way it&apos;s presented is not that it makes sense, it&apos;s that you don&apos;t care.  And that&apos;s not the focus of the film either, the movie would rather be about the minglings of the two leads.\n\nAnd I have to say, Clooney and Pfeiffer have great, perfect chemistry. Clooney is his usual cool, intense self whereas Pfeiffer is an uptight, worrisome hard worker.  They play off each other perfectly.  It&apos;s not just their chemistry either, their performances stand alone as emotional, funny and smart.  I&apos;d go as far as to call Pfeiffer&apos;s Oscar worthy.\n\nThe style and direction in the film is also notable.  There are split-screen conversations, some long steadicam shots, the whole placing of the camera fits perfectly with the light-hearted nature of the film.\n\nA fun, witty, lovable family film, 7.5/10."

      "name": "Eastwood is the Anti-Dirty Harry in this elegant and classy thriller...",
      "reviewBody": "While it might not be the most stylish or fast paced manhunt thriller, Clint Eastwood&apos;s &apos;Blood Work&apos; is still a very enjoyable piece of film. Stylish in its&apos; own manner, this drama returns to the yesteryears of filmmaking and displays Eastwood&apos;s talent as an accomplished Director. Today&apos;s cinema heavily relies on nifty editing effects and fast paced dialogue to retain the interest of the impatient audience, yet Eastwood gives us a refreshing and simplistic tale revolving around the resolution of various dastardly murders.\n\nEastwood stars and directs in this manhunt thriller that still manages to retain the intriguing effect in a film in which the characters; not actions, drive the film. Based on the novel by Michael Connelly, Brian Helgeland (A Knight&apos;s Tale, Payback) transforms the novel into a great script. In this film, Eastwood plays the anti-Dirty Harry in typical Eastwood fashion as he is thrust back onto the case of a vicious serial killer two years after retirement.\n\nAs FBI Agent Terry McCaleb, he is forced off the case after suffering from a near fatal heart attack. Two years after, he is given a new heart and through a freak occurrence with the donor&apos;s heart, he is forced back onto the case allowing for an interesting cat and mouse chase.\n\nEastwood has his imprints all over the film as he sticks with Musical composer Lennie Niehaus for his film once again. Niehaus&apos; sporadic and rare musical additions are usually jazz based and open the film in an elegant manner instead of the usual commercialist propaganda that is not needed when opening a film of this nature.\n\nInstead, Eastwood treats us to a good old-fashioned hunt in which the mystery slowly unravels in front of the viewer allowing for only the clues to be deciphered. The plot is seemingly eerie and for some reason reminded me of Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker&apos;s work (Sleepy Hollow, Seven) for how deliciously evil and calculated the motives for the crimes are. As a true professional, Eastwood lays low on the violence and while there are only a handful of action scenes, the tension builds as the clues become available and the audience begins to piece the puzzle together.\n\nThe ingenious script calls for some sold acting and the casting is excellent as Eastwood calls upon Angelica Huston as his perseverant Doctor and Jeff Daniels who at first seems to be only present for comic relief but has a surprisingly more important and unexpected role. Wanda De Jesus and Tina Lifford are also excellent as they round out the important cast members who all play a giant role in the serial killer&apos;s meticulous and mischievous plot.\n\nAs aforementioned, while it might not elicit the suspense thrills one would find in the Eastwood - Wolfgang Petersen collaboration &apos;In the Line of Fire&apos;, the film still is a well-crafted and engineered film that calls for attention. Yet, one point of contention is a love relationship that happens in the film. True:  Eastwood is a legend and could do whatever he wants with his films, but somehow seeing a man his age hook up with a younger woman under those circumstances seemed to yell out &apos;insanity&apos;. Perhaps to others it fit the film, but in this particular context, it seemed trivial and contrived and can make many wonder if Eastwood simply puts those scenes in to make himself appear to be the epitome of masculinity.  In any event, it was a treat to see a &apos;back-to-basics&apos; thriller that pays off at the end and avoids the formulaic clichés  usually attached to these projects.\n\n Giancarlo&apos;s Rating: **1/2"

      "reviewBody": "Surprisingly because, although the cast is a very talented one, the bird-watching subject is interesting and comedy dramas are enjoyable when done right, the trailer wasn&apos;t particularly very promising and there were the worries of whether anything interesting would be made regarding bird-watching, whether the cast would be well-used and the dangers of the comedy forgetting to be funny or the drama to be too sentimental or both.\n\nThe Big Year is not a perfect film, with the odd predictable part, some pedestrian pacing and for personal tastes some of the historical montage narration was a little irritating and not always necessary despite it being well-delivered by John Cleese. However it is much better than the trailer suggests, in all honesty trailers rarely do their films justice with the trailer being misleading or bad and the film actually being good(the case with The Big Year). The bird-watching subject is dealt with thoughtfully and mostly engagingly if imperfectly, as well as handled with a gentle tone and uplifting at the end. And the script and story do just fine in the comedy and drama. Sure the comedy is not laugh-out-funny which will disappoint people, but it&apos;s gentle, droll humour instead of the crude, broad humour that it could easily have been, and the approach worked and would have suited the film and story much better in the first place. The drama hits the right note too, there&apos;s always a danger in comedy dramas or dramas for the dramatic parts to be over-sentimental, but in my opinion The Big Year did not fall into that trap with it being very poignant and hopeful.\n\nIt&apos;s very beautifully filmed too with strikingly picturesque locations, it is nicely directed and the music from Theodore Shapiro does a good job matching the film&apos;s gentle tone. The characters are sympathetically drawn and played, there&apos;s a danger always in comedy drama to have a character that&apos;s annoying or window-dressing and none of those are present in The Big Year. The acting is strong and no time is wasted on making full use of what makes the actors talented. Steve Martin&apos;s comic timing is as smooth as silk, Jack Black while broad at times is thankfully more subtle than usual and Owen Wilson while not quite as memorable is amiably likable. Luckily they are treated equally by the writers instead of one outweighing the others They are well-supported by an as ever elegant Anjelica Huston, an as always stellar Dianne Wiest and a radiant and sympathetic Rosamund Pike. To me The Big Year was not lacking in chemistry or tension.\n\nOverall, The Big Year is not perfect but it&apos;s a surprisingly good and well done film, that is far better than it was advertised to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

This time, the lasagna-loving feline finds himself in England, where he is mistaken for a royal cat named Prince. The plot thickens with Garfield enjoying the luxurious life while his friends Jon (Breckin Meyer) and Odie get entangled in his adventure.\n\nThe film is light-hearted and filled with comedic moments typical of Garfield&apos;s character. However, much like its predecessor, it relies heavily on slapstick humor and predictable gags. The storyline, inspired by &quot;The Prince and the Pauper,&quot; offers a few charming moments but doesn&apos;t stray far from formulaic family movie tropes.\n\nWhile children might enjoy the antics and visuals, adult fans of the original comic strip might find it lacking in the clever wit and depth that make Garfield timeless. Overall, &quot;Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties&quot; provides some entertainment and nostalgic value but ultimately delivers a middling experience.",

I would&apos;ve preferred a much darker spin and more sinister vibe over this comical TV movie offering but oh well. Octavia was really good as always but the cheap CGI did let the movie down. It&apos;s also been very clear for a number of years now that Anne&apos;s forte are not accents. I mean she sounded comical and even Scottish in certain parts...like girl come on now. It goes without saying that Anjelica Huston&apos;s performance was much stronger and scarier in the 1990 version, but overall the cast, sets and writing were okay.",

      "reviewBody": "In a trench in Bosnia-Herzegovina, two Serbs are looking for Bosnian soldiers. They find one of them apparently dead, and one of the Serbs puts a fragmentation mine under his body. Ciki (Branko Djuric), another Bosnian soldier hidden in the trench, shoots at them. In the end, the apparently dead Bosnian soldier Cera (Filip Sovagovic) is indeed alive with a mine under his body, and Bosnian Ciki and the Serb Nino (Rene Bitorajac) are hurt and equally armed in an even situation. They decide to ask for help in a very peculiar way. The French UN soldier Marchand (Georges Siatidis) tries to help the men and disobeys his superiors order, using the journalist Jane Livingstone (Katrin Cartlidge) as a kind of scapegoat in a very uncommon situation. In the end, a circus is armed in the trench and nothing is resolved. Yesterday, I saw this excellent movie for the third time. In a surrealistic situation, the director Danis Tanovic offers the universe of this insane war using a few characters. It is very metaphoric and has a kind of black humor. We have two Bosnians and two Serbs, one of them having the sick idea of mining a dead body. The rage among the three survivors alternates with some dialogs about a common friend and who initiated the war. Indeed, they do not clearly know why they are fighting against each other, and the other soldiers are unable to identify who is who without wearing uniforms. The ridiculous, bureaucratic and hypocrite role of the UN in this war is explicitly demonstrated. Maybe this is the unique film that really touches the wound relative to the performance of UN in this war. The idealist soldier is unable to help whom needs and feels very frustrated when the situation is ended. The journalists trying to obtain a matter, but not taking care in investigating `the trench&apos; a little further after achieving their objectives.  `No Man&apos;s Land&apos; is another excellent movie about the Bosnian war, inclusive an Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film in 2001, and highly recommended for any audience. If the reader likes this theme, I would like to suggest the excellent `Harrison&apos;s Flowers&apos;, `Vukovar&apos;, `Pretty Village, Pretty Flame&apos;, `Shot Through the Heart&apos;, `Welcome to Sarajevo&apos; and `Savior&apos;. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): `Terra de Ninguém&apos;  (`No Man&apos;s Land&apos;)",

In the case of this film, the dancing is central to the survival of the colony, all of which is just metaphor for having imagination and invincible spirit to overcome the odds.\n\nThe chances for Happy Feet Two being sappy and repetitive were significant, but its ebullient spirit, gifted voices like Robin Williams,&apos; and a creative plot make the penguins an unlikely symbol of intrepid imagination. Anyway, when I hid in a trench in New Zealand to see the little lovelies trundle home as they always do at the same time each day, I was hooked to see an animation renewing our cultural romance with penguins and the beast fable itself."

      "reviewBody": "***It&apos;s too bad that this movie came out in the same year as &quot;Bridesmaids.&quot; That coincidence contributes to shallow thinkers erroneously setting these two films against each other. Both share a basic scenario: a bridal party in the days before a wedding. Aside from that, they are completely different movies. \n\nPick two &quot;Civil War&quot; films. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and &quot;Gettysburg.&quot; There&apos;s room in the world for both. \n\n&quot;Bridesmaids&quot; was a hilarious film.***\n\nSo now... THIS movie, called &quot;Bachelorette.&quot; \n\nThis is a dark, edgy, uncomfortable comedy. The characters are realistically flawed. They do ugly things and treat each other badly. They also obviously care for each other and make some astute observations about life. There are too many weirdly, subversively funny moments to list.\n\nIf you watch it expecting a light, breezy &quot;chick flick&quot; you will be disappointed. If you watch it expecting a gritty, grimly hilarious portrait of three very human women trying to overcome their own flaws and self-inflicted disasters, you&apos;ll have a damn good time.\n\nNotes: 1) Kirsten Dunst is awesome playing a tightly-wound, abrasive control freak. I love the hard edge she has here. And the way her face betrays the fact she&apos;s always on the verge of coming apart at the seams.\n\n2) Lizzy Caplan. FINALLY in a movie and role worthy of her comedic talents.\n\n3) Rebel Wilson. Naturally hilarious. Too bad her role necessitates under-utilizing her gifts.\n\n4) James Marsden. I&apos;ve only ever seen him in good-guy roles (at which he is excellent). It&apos;s a confirmation of his skill that he&apos;s equally great at playing a sleazeball manipulator.\n\n5) June Diane Raphael. The uniquely nutty, endlessly comical Raphael&apos;s cameo in the bathroom with Lizzy Caplan is easily the funniest scene in the movie.",

So I decided to watch it again an hour later to understand the whole story, and then every scene from the start made sense within the film plot.\n\nThe twists and turns of this movie make you pay attention to every detail throughout the hour and a half of its duration, which is not common in movies nowadays.

Despite terrific special effect, it is choppy, uneventful, and an insult to the viewer&apos;s intelligence. But in all due seriousness, THAT WAS THE POINT!\n\nThis film, in it&apos;s original, pre-Renegade edition form, was not meant to be taken seriously. It was just a campy, fun film designed to be a reunion of the characters from part one. If you watch it expecting something deep, you won&apos;t like it. But if you view it as it was intended to be viewed, as a light-hearted reunion of Lambert and Connery for ninety minutes of fun, than FUN is what you&apos;ll get. Consider it like an early experiment of something &quot;Fifth Element&quot; perfected: a campy but good sci-fi film.\n\nWith this in mind, give it a try."

      "reviewBody": "To be honest, I don&apos;t really know about the Romance of the three kingdom so I will start my review about the movie with no reference to the Chinese history. I have watched Daniel Lee&apos;s Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon and it is just average. I have only seen one movie based on the Romance of the three kingdom. John Woo makes his comeback as a director after so many years. I think it is worth the wait for his highly anticipated movie.\n\nThe story: In Singapore, the movie is split into two parts. The second part will be shown next year. This movie is an introduction to the Romance of the three kingdom. The first war starts when the movie starts to hype up those craving to see some good war battles. After the first war, you will get introduction of the characters slowly. After the slightly slow pace, you are treated to another war. The acting is good with the humour. I think model Lin Chiling should be given some credit as she marks the first acting debut in a Chinese blockbuster.\n\nOverall: It has both the talk and the action. I must say that it is one of the recently interesting war movies with extended war battle unlike the other recent war movies. It should be good to watch it in cinema. This movie is good for those who want to know about the Chinese history or those who want to see the Chinese history in action.",

      "reviewBody": "To be exact, Kill the Messenger isn&apos;t mainly about the CIA conspiracy which was exposed in 1996. This is more of Gary Webb&apos;s journey of unraveling some secrets behind the story and facing the consequences of revealing too much classified information to the public. The film shifts from conspiracy thriller to familial drama to give a clear statement of what struggles do honest journalists usually get. The direction seems to have higher interests when it comes to the conspiracy thriller mode, but when it eases down, it doesn&apos;t have the same enthusiasm. Thankfully, the star of the film, Jeremy Renner, carries the whole thing, making the overall experience absolutely engrossing.\n\nThe film isn&apos;t really that straightforward when it comes to its historical side, though the first half does have a keen focus on picking up huge details from one source to another. The film triumphs when it only stays to that root, taking us to a process of how journalism works. But that point didn&apos;t get much of the flow, because again the whole message of this film is the danger of getting into this situation. The other half of the movie concerns Webb&apos;s protection with his family, while it is important to get to know about his personal life, it sort of feels like a stretched intrusion to what else interesting happening. The rest of the story, specifically the effects of the exposé to the public, remains to be a series of real life footage of mobs and interviews. The film comes to life once again when they face the actual consequences instead of verbalizing their paranoia.\n\nIt could have been clunky, but the film totally benefits having Jeremy Renner. Even at its weakest scenes, the actor tend to bring real depth and tension, joining the audience to what his role is going through. This performance alone can be an instant recommendation to its entirety. The direction, as said, seems to spare its energy more on the investigation and suspense, which could have been straightforward in reporting the facts and putting the melodrama to the sidelines. The craft is solid as well, there are some strong production and stunning shots to be found.\n\nKill the Messenger is more ambitious in its sentiments of valuing the truth and going against political corruption, but it doesn&apos;t satisfy enough to reporting its history, especially when the movie is really good at depicting it. It just eventually becomes a cautionary film for journalists about exposing a vulnerable truth, showing us the main character and his family possibly at risk after what he has done. It works when it finally acknowledges that the government is now their enemy and building suspense behind Webb&apos;s back, but when it focuses to the drama of his personal life, it doesn&apos;t seem to fit on the pieces, however whatever made it still thoroughly watchable, again, is the acting of Renner. This is the type of merit that steals much of the value of the film, even if it&apos;s flawed in storytelling, the appeal just keeps on going.",

Its&apos; heart and message are so in the right place, but it plays like a schmaltzy movie of the week. Jennifer Garner, whom I have really enjoyed in other roles, overplays this one and is very disappointing. The kid who plays Timothy is good enough. His young female friend Odeya Rush is the best in the cast. Joel Edgerton is perfect for Lifetime movie of the week. They are all really likable. So I just wished I liked the film more. And the message is terrific. I cry in schmaltzy films but I think it says much about this film in that the only time it brought any tears was in the final scene which was grounded in reality. When the fantasy was going I just wasn&apos;t sucked in.\n\n7 may be a generous rating, but this is a solid family film with a strong positive message. There is a big audience out there for this film. I don&apos;t really want to discourage them from seeing it.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a shame that so much negative criticism focuses on Deconstructing Harry&apos;s bad language, because this is one of Allen&apos;s funniest, smartest and most perceptive films. In fact, it may actually be his best film full stop  only Manhattan and Crimes and Misdemeanours can challenge Harry. But although the bad language and crudity may affect some people&apos;s enjoyment of the film, for me, as someone who loves bad taste, it&apos;s a major benefit, especially as it&apos;s a side of Allen we rarely see. I mean, we&apos;re used to the romantic Allen and the neurotic Allen, and we&apos;ve even had serious Allen, but here you have Allen almost becoming Philip Roth. It&apos;s very enjoyable to watch.\n\nIn this film, Allen&apos;s alter ego is Harry Block, a writer in the mould of Philip Roth who, in the words of one his exes, turns everyone else&apos;s suffering into literary gold. And this assertion is corroborated by the opening scene, a section from one his books where a man and a woman who are having an affair, during a barbecue, decide to have sex in a bathroom while their spouses are eating in the garden. It&apos;s a very funny scene, especially as an attempted blow-job is interrupted by a false alarm (the woman grinds her teeth when the man spots his wife) and as some doggy-style sex is interrupted by the woman&apos;s blind grandmother coming into the room (when asked what&apos;s happening, the woman tells her grandmother that she&apos;s making Martinis while they continue banging away). But while the scene is absolutely hilarious, it does also have a point. This is a scene from Harry&apos;s life. He&apos;s using it in his work. Therefore his ex isn&apos;t too happy to find this episode in his book. Of course, Harry tries to explain that it was &apos;loosely based&apos; (the grandmother was an embellishment), but that doesn&apos;t cut much ice with his ex, who&apos;s having all of the sordid details of her affair revealed to friends and family. So the film touches on ideas of a writer&apos;s responsibility. What&apos;s exploitation and what&apos;s inspiration?\n\nOne of the most revealing sections of the film is when Harry talks to his therapist. He discusses his attitude to women. &quot;I&apos;m always thinking of f****** every woman I meet I see a woman on a bus. I think what she looks like naked. Is it possible I might f*** her?&quot; Essentially Harry is a man who has never grown up. He can&apos;t commit and he can&apos;t sustain a relationship with a woman, a fact backed up by his string of exes and his affection for prostitutes. Indeed, for him, whores are perfect. You don&apos;t have to woo them, they don&apos;t nag you and they do whatever you want; all you&apos;ve got to do is pay them. And in the film, Harry takes Cookie, a black prostitute (&quot;Do you know what a black hole is?&quot; Harry asks her. &quot;Yeah, that&apos;s how I make my living.&quot;) with him to an honouring ceremony at his old school.\n\nHarry also takes a friend along with him and his young son  well, he actually &apos;kidnaps&apos; his son. And the whole journey, the whole act of going back to remember the past, brings back memories of stories he wrote, stories that are thinly veiled versions of actual events. One of the funniest is a story of a man who married his therapist. At first everything is great, the woman understands the man like no other woman in the world. But once they have a child she becomes &quot;Jewish with a vengeance&quot;. No longer is she smart and funny and sexy; all of a sudden she&apos;s a dowdy nag who&apos;s rediscovered her religion. And in one hilarious moment she even prays before administering a blow-job. Again it&apos;s highly amusing, but again it has a point; Harry wants everything to remain perfect. He can&apos;t understand why people have to change. I mean, even having a child doesn&apos;t change him. He talks to his son about naming his penis. He may be getting on, but he&apos;s still really just a kid.\n\nHarry&apos;s whole life philosophy is neatly summed up by his half-sister: &quot;You have no values. With you it&apos;s all nihilism, cynicism, sarcasm and orgasm.&quot; To which Harry quips, &quot;Hey, in France I could run for office with that slogan, and win!&quot; But although Harry may be deemed to be juvenile, he&apos;s entirely correct about religion. He tells his devout sister that they&apos;re clubs and that their function is to exclude people. And then he asks her whether it bothers her more when a Jew gets killed or a gentile. She says a Jew death bothers her more  &quot;They&apos;re my people.&quot; &quot;They&apos;re all our people,&quot; he replies. I&apos;m with Harry. Religions are nothing but divisive. Plus they encourage people to prove how devout they are  as if you can be more Jewish than someone else, or more Catholic etc. It all becomes a competition.\n\nBut amongst all this, the only thing that Harry can do to remain sane is to write. Somehow life doesn&apos;t make any sense but fiction does. I guess it&apos;s a problem most writers have. To able to write you have to observe, but the more you observe the less you understand why people behave the way they do. Plus the more you observe the more you actually remove yourself from life. However, self-examination does allow Harry to become more perceptive as regards himself. In fact, his characters help him out a lot, as they offer insights that he couldn&apos;t possibly come up with alone. So although the film&apos;s coarse, it ends up being quite optimistic. Salvation lies within."

I don&apos;t know what those who rated it so poorly were expecting, but for me, it was just what I expected - enough chuckles to be entertaining, pretty Christmas scenery, and a touching story. My 17 and 12-year-old sons liked it as well. I thought Vince Vaughn played his typical character, which is always good for a laugh or two, though rarely one you would choke yourself on. I don&apos;t think the movie would necessarily go over with the pre-school crowd because it&apos;s not &quot;The Santa Claus,&quot; but children who are old enough to understand the emotions being portrayed should enjoy it. There are a couple of sexual innuendos that may offend the more conservative viewers, but they likely go over the heads of the youngsters. I&apos;m always amazed at the range of reviews movies get here at IMDb, and they truly show why we&apos;ll never all get along. I found this particular film both entertaining and moving, which is all I usually ask, particularly of a Holiday film. While &quot;Fred Claus&quot; doesn&apos;t go beyond the call of duty so to speak, it certainly lived up to my expectations.",

      "reviewBody": "Michael Crichton&apos;s Rising Sun is an extensive, dense, unpredictable mess. The actors have a lot of fun and the story is a splurge of entertainment, but it&apos;s not paying enough attention to a couple of things. One of them is what its focus is. Is the film about the murder, the two men solving the murder, the clash of American and Japanese cultures, or what? The other thing the film forgets could be a drawback of the first thing. It&apos;s that it doesn&apos;t tie up all its loose ends. At the end, there are strands left with no ending, even a mysterious ambiguous one. It just ends because it feels the pace of the film requires it to fade out at that particular point.\n\nThe film is not bad, mostly because it&apos;s far from boring. In fact, there are many scenes of dialogue, despite a few corny scenes of dialogue, that are subtly interesting. We don&apos;t quite understand why the exchanges are interesting until later, when we realize that the characters are so deeply contemplated that the scene felt as real as the room you&apos;re sitting in. But maybe I&apos;m giving the film too much credit for simply being a load of fun for Michael Crichton to write. After all, he wrote and directed one of the greatest heist films ever made, The Great Train Robbery, also with Sean Connery.\n\nSean Connery, of course, is the highlight of the film, because there&apos;s hardly a way he cannot be. Despite his irrepressible suavity, he does not play himself. He plays a resentful, inflexible, self-indulgent veteran cop, and we are supposed to like Wesley Snipes more because the film centers, well, seems to want to center around his character and also we&apos;re given more backstory and information on him. However, we don&apos;t like Snipes more than him. Connery may play a stubborn old jerk, but I&apos;d rather one of those than a pompous, intolerant, overpround young jerk like Snipes can hardly help but play.\n\nI cannot reach a verdict on this film. How can I? There are so many things to enjoy at the same time they are hazardous to the film&apos;s health.",

Carmen Maura steals the show as a woman close to the edge, but her performance is fully backed up by all the rest of the cast.  Antonio Banderas performance is excellent as a geeky young man, with his girlfriend and mother also shining.  It combines all the elements of American comedy of the sixties but brings it back at us with a touch of latin spirit.  This film in my opinion is a gem, for anyone who wants to laugh!"

Be it our main character hiding in the bush(es) of his neighbor or proclaiming he isn&apos;t able to control his hand. Something boys may like to claim when they discover their sexuality I reckon.\n\nBut while this has a bit of nudity (literally) and some hot situations, it does focus more on the horror and comedy stuff it has. It does get violent and it does have blood in it - but it also is as funny as it gets. And one of the reasons is how Devon Sawa is able to do all the physical stuff himself. He says himself he was young and just threw himself in everything - have to admit very well done.\n\nI liked the movie back when it came out and I still like it - it seems to had some issues when it was released because of a massive school schooting in America - Politicians blaming movies and games for that - which those involved sarcastically take apart in the commentary on the newly released Blu Ray.\n\nThere are so many funny and good moments in here ... but there are also questionable decisions. Jessica Alba being attracted to someone who has shows red flags than you can imagine. Do not watch this taking it apart for those reasons if you can - the movie does not tell us what we should do when it comes to the opposite sex. This after all is a movie - if you can&apos;t detach that from your moral views, you may have/take issues with the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie that I have always liked. When I was a kid, I used to watch this every other day. It is underrated if you look at its IMDb rating and the comments of many people in general. This isn&apos;t a bad movie like many say, it is a very good movie. This is good and your kids will probably like it. Even though it&apos;s rated G, some parents may find this to be a bit violent. It is actually a pretty dark story, where the dogs are similar to mobsters who are involved in gambling, extortion, and even cold blooded murder. The movie follows a dog named Charlie who had escaped from the pound, is killed by his old friend, goes to heaven, but ends up coming back to earth. Many younger kids watching this movie may feel as though they are watching a big kids movie. \n\nThere are some scenes that may scare little kids, but I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll do fine. Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me of when I was a little kid. I&apos;m sure everyone has a movie that reminds them of when they were younger, this is the movie that makes me feel that way. The performances from Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great, and this is the last movie that a little girl named Judith Barsi was in. Unfortunately, she was killed at a young age, which is a shame because she had so much potential and didn&apos;t deserve what happened. Now that I know her story, I can&apos;t watch this movie the same way anymore because her voice sounds so sad. \n\nThe animation in this movie is great, the voice work is great, and the story is good, but a little bit different from many other kids movies. This was popular at the time of its release, but was over shadowed by Disney&apos;s mega popular The Little Mermaid. This is a movie that isn&apos;t conceived as well by adults, but if you&apos;re a kid, or if you grew up with this movie as a kid, then I&apos;m sure you will enjoy watching it.",

I can get that it is not the best Will Ferrell movie ever but it deserves more than a one star rating. So I&apos;ll give it a six just to balance the ratings a bit better. But I&apos;m aware it&apos;s not a great movie. And I am a big Will Ferrell fan, as well as for Amy Poehler. So when I saw they both played in this movie I was a bit excited. A bit too over-excited when I saw the final outcome. Besides a couple good laughing moments the rest of the movie is a bit bland. The story is about okay, at least for a comedy, but it clearly lacks some convincing acting. But I don&apos;t regret watching it, like some do, I just was expecting better. I guess for watching it once it&apos;s okay, just for the couple laughs I had.",

      "reviewBody": "Although my title might sound like a jab, I mean it literally. If you like movies where nothing happens, &quot;New York, I Love You&quot; is a good one to catch.\n\nSo if nothing happens, what&apos;s it all about? Well, here we have 10 slice-of-life vignettes of people living in New York City focusing on interpersonal relationships, character drama, and in almost every story some sort of quirky ironic twist.\n\nIn a few cases the ironic twist is enough to make you say to yourself, &quot;Aha! Good one.&quot; Segments in this category include a segment starring Robin Wright &amp; Chris Cooper about a woman &amp; man who meet on the street flirting with the idea of anonymous sex, or in the segment starring Olivia Thirlby, James Caan &amp; Anton Yelchin about a boy who goes to the prom with a girl in a wheelchair, or the opening segment starring Hayden Christensen &amp; Andy Garcia about a petty thief who meets his match. Or an impressive directing debut from Natalie Portman about a man who takes a young girl to the park for a day. Each of these may seem light on story, but there&apos;s a nice twist to each.\n\nOther segments are a little less twisty in plot, but they make up for it with charming characters or quirky conversations, like the segment with Ethan Hawke using every line in the book to pick up a mysterious woman, or the segment starring the screen legends Eli Wallach (&quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;) &amp; Cloris Leechman (&quot;Frau Blucher!&quot; in Young Frankenstein) about an elderly couple who go to Coney Island for the day.\n\nAnd then there&apos;s the segment starring Julie Christie as a lonely, retired opera singer who checks into an ancient hotel for a night. That segment stands out for its haunting style and quiet desperation.\n\n&quot;New York, I Love You&quot; is the American version of &quot;Paris je t&apos;aime&quot; released two years earlier, each film featuring a series of shorts highlighting the human love affair with an iconic city. Oddly enough, &quot;New York&quot; features all but 2 directors who were born outside America (including Natalie Portman--did you know she was born in Israel?), so there is a very culturally diverse vibe. This ain&apos;t no &quot;Friends&quot; centered around young professional caucasians. It often digs deep into the ethnic perspective with characters who are Jewish (Hacidic), Hindu (Jain...although he points out that Jains are not Hindu because Hinduism is too materialistic haha), Chinese, Iranian, British, and a few I couldn&apos;t figure out.\n\nMy only real gripe with this film is that it seemed uneven at times, with the directing styles and stories often shifting gears so abruptly, and without any signals to let you know the prior story had ended and we&apos;re on to the next, that you can easily get disoriented. Transitions with characters&apos; paths criss-crossing were inserted to make it more of a cohesive whole, but I think the opposite effect happened. I might&apos;ve liked it better if the stories were kept very separate, like in the excellent &quot;Tokyo!&quot; featuring 3 very different stories from very different directors. But as far as short film compilations go, &quot;New York, I Love You&quot; is a good solid package that should tickle your nostalgia bone whether or not you hail from the Big Apple.\n\nI can&apos;t end without mentioning my favorite film in this genre, &quot;Coffee &amp; Cigarettes&quot; by Jim Jarmusch, featuring 11 short films set in Coffee Shops around the world. If you like this sort of thing, definitely check that one out."

Instead the movie dealt with family conflict similar to Encanto. Instead of granddaughter who had issues with a grandmother, this film dealt with problems among three generations of fathers and sons.\n\nMost of the movie takes place in a beautiful unexplored place near the community of Avalonia. Avalonia is a land surrounded by impassable mountains. No one knows what is on the other side. Our explorers leave on a quest to discover why an important crop is failing. In the process, they not only discover a new land, but also discover more about themselves.\n\nThe scenery is gorgeous. The new place looks like cross between an underwater ocean and regular land. Starfish-looking creatures swing through the trees. A pod of skate-type creatures swim through the air. It reminded me of an ocean enough that I felt myself relax the same way I do when I look at a real ocean. Ahhhhhh\n\nSome people may not enjoy the movie as there is no princess, no singing, and no big baddie to defeat. I enjoyed the movie.\n\nSince I now know what the new land is, I&apos;ll see if I can spot the clues the next time I watch it. I did spot one clue, but brushed it off as the animators attempts to make the landscape look alien.\n\nI do recommend this film.",

      "reviewBody": "Years ago I had a conversation with some young guy who worked on the loading docks. He was frustrated by his life, felt inarticulate and incapable of escaping his plight or of really doing anything with his life. He had the wish but not the talent to express himself through art and felt he had nothing to look forward to. I thought of him while watching The Good Girl, a movie about a very ordinary person trapped in a hum drum existence. \n\nI&apos;ve noticed some discussion in these reviews as to whether The Good Girl is a comedy or drama, and I would suggest people stop trying to label the movie. The Good Girl clearly isn&apos;t trying to be either, but simply a movie that captures the life of someone who feels trapped, portraying both the drama and comedy inherent in life. It&apos;s a small, studied, intelligently written movie that&apos;s well worth watching. Don&apos;t worry about what it is, just watch it and take it the way you take life, not as a comedy or drama but just as what it is.",

      "reviewBody": "After a grueling journey from Scotland to America on a quest to reunite with his beloved, Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee) crosses paths with a mysterious drifter named Silas (Michael Fassbender) in the forests of Colorado. It&apos;s fortuitous timing, as Jay has gotten himself into a bit of trouble, and Silas understands that violence is necessary in order to survive in the west - a concept which the timid youth struggles to grasp.\n\nFor a price, Silas offers to accompany Jay on his journey to locate his sweetheart - although as we learn through a series of flashbacks sprinkled throughout the film, Rose (Caren Pistorius) may not be terribly excited to see Jay again. But she&apos;ll almost certainly be less excited by an introduction to Silas, who knows that a reward has been offered for the capture of Rose and her father (Rory McCann) in relation to a crime that occurred before their journey to America.\n\nFurther complicating matters is Payne (Ben Mendelsohn) and his group of bounty hunters, with whom Silas has a prior relationship. After crossing paths with Jay in the woods, Payne and his men seem to always be lurking just out of sight, lending the latter half of the film a near-constant sense of foreboding as we keep waiting for them to strike.\n\nSlow West gradually peels back the layers of its narrative while constantly remaining focused on the burgeoning friendship between Jay and Silas. Despite his distaste for ferocity, Jay finds himself becoming increasingly reliant on Silas and his wisdom, while Silas tries to fight a growing desire to protect the boy from the dangers of a world he isn&apos;t prepared for.\n\nDirector John MacLean (who also wrote the screenplay) gives the quieter moments just enough room to breathe before punctuating them with instances of absurdly black humor or sudden, brutal flashes of violence, both of which seem to have been influenced by the likes of Quentin Tarantino and the Coen Brothers. Of particular note is a tense, riveting shootout during the film&apos;s climax, featuring a moment so farcical that I burst out laughing in spite of the on screen carnage. It&apos;s the kind of thing only the most competent of filmmakers could get away with, and MacLean absolutely nails it.\n\nBut despite MacLean&apos;s prowess as a writer and director, Slow West ultimately succeeds on the strength of its cast, with Smit-McPhee as the wide-eyed innocent and Fassbender as the grizzled, trail-weary wanderer. Mendelsohn deserves a nod for being suitably creepy as the flick&apos;s sort-of villain, but at its heart, this is a coming-of-age story about a young man in need of a strong role model and father figure, who finds it in the most unlikely of places.",

      "reviewBody": "Movies that are based on Saturday Night Live sketches usually fall flat at the box office. Its hard to stretch one little sketch into a full length film obviously. Magruber is not a film for the sensitive. It is very vulgar and its hero is more annoying then anything else. Will Forte just doesn&apos;t chew the scenery, he grinds it into baby food! Val Kilmer pretty much does the same as the bad guy. What made me like this film isn&apos;t its star, but Kristen Wiig as Vicki and Ryan Phillippe as Lt. Piper. They both give great comic performances. Wiig has a howlingly funny moment in the coffee shop while shes wearing a wire. Actually the real hero of the film is Piper, if it hadn&apos;t been for him Magruber would have been dead several times over. In addition, Powers Boothe gives a great performance as Magruber&apos;s frustrated commanding officer. I wanted to mention that I learned something watching this film, I didn&apos;t know what a double decker was, now I do."

This film has turned out to be a seminal one:  legal drama has turned overwhelmingly to rumination of the moral interstices of the law like the one portrayed here.  Without &quot;The Verdict,&quot; we wouldn&apos;t have &quot;The Practice.&quot;  Gone are the days when all of Perry Mason&apos;s clients were innocent.\n\nPaul Newman&apos;s performance has been justifiably enshrined in the pantheon of Circumstances When The Academy Dropped The Ball.  But what made the film a truly emotional performance for me was Lindsay Crouse as the pivotal witness.  The entire ensemble was flawless, as was the incredible atmosphere.  &quot;The Verdict&quot; is probably too serious for some movie fans, and that&apos;s OK--no film can please everyone.  But if you like to be given something to think about by your entertainments, this is the film for you."

In today&apos;s Hollywood so many comedies fall into the trap of deplorable slapstick and gratuitous cussing, &quot;Roxanne&quot; succeeds in entertaining us through colorful characters, enchanting surprises, and witty intelligent dialogue. Where have movies like this gone to?  Where were they to begin with?  A rare jewel in the sands of Hollywood, see this movie like your life depends on it (tip to the wise:  take a date).

      "reviewBody": "A lot of people compare Dark Places to Gone Girl and say, book-wise, Gone Girl was the better book. I actually liked Dark Places better, so when I found out they were making it into a movie, I was of course skeptical about whether or not it&apos;d be good. I just finished watching it and was happy that my skepticism was for naught - this movie stayed true to the book. Casting was done well and the flow proved that the screenplay writers &amp; director paid attention to the original book.\n\nThe book is dark, has some twists and turns and doesn&apos;t gloss over anything. Where in Gone Girl I felt like some scenes were made a little lighter for the screen, Dark Places doesn&apos;t have that issue. The sets were also very accurate - it&apos;s been YEARS since I read the book, but while watching the movie everything came back to me...the layout of the farm house, the crappy apartment Libby lived in as an adult with her collection of stolen items...all the way down to crap hole Runner was living in...\n\nThis is not going to be a big blockbuster. Most people will not like it (as you can tell by the ratings) but I will tell you, if you like thrillers/mysteries with twists and turns then watch it. If you&apos;ve read the book, watch it. It&apos;s not the greatest movie ever done, but it was good enough that I felt compelled to write my first IMDb review.\n\nAnd even if you don&apos;t watch the movie, read the book. If you like Patterson, Demille or Clancy, you&apos;ll like Dark Places.",

Missy as a role is supossed to be unnerving, and the moments of surprising normality from her.....well i can honestly say that i&apos;ve met people like that, annoying and good persons almost at the same time.\n\nIt&apos;s not a great movie, but i can honestly say, i&apos;had some fun.

Criticisms include failure to match the original's impact, weak scares, predictable plot, and pacing issues. Ellen Burstyn's inclusion is seen as underutilized. Some appreciate religious themes and character development, while others find it formulaic and lacking genuine horror.

There seem to be too many ideas floating around that never get handled properly. The creepy factor was null and void. A couple of jump scares are thrown in. Perhaps the film&apos;s biggest mistake is having the legacy character, Chris (Ellen Burstyn), wasted here as the studio&apos;s cliche cash grab for nostalgic fans. An overall weak script, cringe dialogue, and plenty of corny group exorcism moments to go around. The film really treats its audience like they&apos;re stupid.

      "reviewBody": "It helps to know that this was originally brought to life as a Terrence Malick screenplay about Che&apos;s disastrous forray in Bolivia. Financing fell through and Soderbergh stepped in to direct. He conceived a first part and shot both back to back as one film trailing Che&apos;s rise and fall.\n\nHe retained however what I believe would be Malick&apos;s approach: no politics and a just visual poem about the man behind the image, exhaustive as the horrible slog through Cuban jungles and windswept Andean plateaus must have been. Malick applied this to his New World that he abandoned Che for, lyrical many times over.\n\nBut Soderbergh being an ambitious filmmaker, he puzzled over this a little more. Here was a man of action at the center of many narratives about him, some fashioned by himself, conflictingly reported as iconic revolutionary or terrorist, charismatic leader or ruthless thug, erudite Marxist thinker or brutal soldier.\n\nSo how to visually exemplify this contradicting ethos as our film about him? And how to arrange a world around this person in such a way as to absorb him whole, unfettered from narrative - but writing it as he goes along - off camera - but ironically on - and as part of that world where narratives are devised to explain him. As flesh and bones, opposed to a cutout from a history book.\n\nOne way to do this, would be via Brecht and artifice. The Korda photograph would reveal lots, how we know people from images, how we build narratives from them. Eisenstein sought the same in a deeper way, coming up with what he termed the &apos;dialectical montage&apos;: a world assembled by the eye, and in such ways as the eye aspires to create it.\n\nSo what Soderbergh does, is everything by halves: a dialectic between two films trailing opposite sides of struggle, glory and failure, optimism and despair. Two visual palettes, two points of view in the first film, one in the presence of cameras hoping to capture the real person, the other were that image was being forged in action.\n\nThe problem, is of course that Brecht and Eisenstein made art in the hope to change the world, to awaken consciousness, Marxist art with its trappings. By now we have grown disillusioned with the idea, and Soderbergh makes no case and addresses no present struggles.\n\nBut we still have the cinematic essay about all this.\n\nThe first part: a narrative broadcast from real life, meant to reveal purpose, ends, revolution. The second part: we get to note in passing a life that is infinitely more expansive than any story would explain, more complex, beautiful, frustrating, and devoid of any apparent purpose other than what we choose as our struggle, truly a guerilla life.\n\nI imagine a tremendous film from these notions. Just notice the remarkable way Part 2 opens. Che arrives at Bolivia in disguise, having shed self and popular image. No longer minister, spokesman, diplomat, guerilla, he is an ordinary man lying on a hotel bed, one among many tourists. Life could be anything once more, holds endless possibility. Cessation.\n\nWhat does he do? He begins to fashion the same narrative as before, revolution again. Chimera this time. Transient life foils him in Bolivia.

      "reviewBody": "So many people do not like this movie simply because they do not understand it.  First of all, yes the movie is full of stereotypes, but that&apos;s the point.  They&apos;re there to show how ridiculous these stereotypes really are and to show that in the end, you cannot change who you are, you just have to learn to accept it and get the people around you to accept you.  Second, some stereotypes that I&apos;ve heard people notice really weren&apos;t there.  I don&apos;t think anywhere in the movie did they try to make Christians look stupid (hey, the homophobic Christians are pretty good at making themselves look stupid WITHOUT help).  Okay maybe Megan&apos;s comment about &quot;God is good, God is straight - hey that&apos;s pretty good,&quot; but still, I think sometimes people LOOK for something to be offended by.  I think this movie does make fun of many straight people, who claim that gays are recruiting, when it is actually the other way around (as one can see by the existence of True Directions, and in the fact that when Megan asks them to teach her to be a lesbian, they tell her that they can&apos;t do that).  All in all, this is a great movie and I really enjoyed it!  As for people who didn&apos;t, hey, you&apos;re allowed to not like it, but if it is for reasons that really don&apos;t seem warranted, maybe you should give But I&apos;m a Cheerleader another look."

      "reviewBody": "Good: Some of the messages and morals of the story are heartfelt for its intended audience of children. The saving grace is Chris Pine. Even though he had a small role, he fit the role perfectly and was not so excessive. The color scheme is very bright and colorful, which makes the movie somewhat interesting, even with the subpar acting and plot.....\n\nBad: The acting all around is either subar from the cast or over the top from Mindy Kaling and Zach Galifianakis that it comes out unnatural. Even with a good cast consisting of Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon, they did not add much to the movie&apos;s benefit. Disney spent so much money on its adult characters that they forgot to hire good child actors/actresses for the child cast members are not even on par with some of the amazing child stars from &quot;Stranger Things,&quot; &quot;It,&quot; or &quot;Jungle Book.&quot;\n\nOverall: The movie is mainly geared towards elementary and middle school children with some adult aspects, yet the movie is childish and not up to Disney&apos;s standard. Disney should be embarrassed to have produced such a movie with big Hollywood names and have it bomb. The movie falls flat and lacks humor leading to a failure for Disney. Even though this movie is supposed to be a big statement towards diversity with a colored director helming a $100 million budget project, the movie does not do justice.\n\n2/5",

      "reviewBody": "When Altman is good he&apos;s among the greatest, and SHORT CUTS is among his best (M*A*S*H, BREWSTER McCLOUD, NASHVILLE). Adapted from Raymond Carver&apos;s collection of stories, SHORT CUTS offers a roving, restless glimpse into the lives of several Los Angelinos. The characters aren&apos;t completely real - in an &apos;I-can-relate-to-these-people&apos; sense (I never expected this from this movie anyway), but are presented in a slightly hyperreal sense with Altman highlighting the everyday lives of characters who try valiantly to maintain their public personas (cutting across class boundaries in the process), even when things are spinning out of control beneath the surface (literally symbolized by the ending, though at least he didn&apos;t stoop to throwing in a rain of frogs...). \n\nLos Angeles is famously mocked as a place that&apos;s all surface and no depth (see ANNIE HALL), and the slight exaggerations seen here characters plays with this, even as the isolation and instability of certain characters humanizes them. Through it all there&apos;s plenty of humor - though, as is usual with Altman, even the humor packs a wallop. Annie Ross&apos; deadpan complaint gets to the heart of it all: &quot;I hate L.A. - all they do is snort coke and talk.&quot; The irony in such nastiness becomes a bit more apparent when you consider where that assessment is coming from, within Altman&apos;s tragi-comic variant upon the notion that California&apos;s trends become America&apos;s truisms a decade or two down the road.\n\nThere are so many great moments here - Chris Penn&apos;s growing befuddlement (and seething, simmering murderous anger) with his wife&apos;s phone sex operator job; Tom Waits and Lily Tomlin as a boozy working class couple; Peter Gallagher and Frances MacDormand&apos;s marriage, collapsed into tantrums and furniture vandalism; the Tim Robbins/Huey Lewis confrontation; Jack Lemmon, Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine all deliver strikingly memorable performances. Every time I watch this, I get something new out of it - though it requires a bit of patience, SHORT CUTS is really worth checking out.",

It explores human resilience and migrant worker struggles, though some note deviations from the novel. Pacing is divisive, with mixed opinions on its deliberate rhythm. Technical aspects like cinematography and A. R. Rahman's music are praised, despite VFX issues and logical inconsistencies.

Actor Prithviraj Sukumaran underwent an arduous transformation for this role, and his performance is amplified by stunning visuals and a haunting score. Director Blessy&apos;s tale is an exploration of hope and resilience that lingers long after the credits roll.

      "reviewBody": "A couple of nights ago, I rented two movies at my local Blockbuster Video out of curiosity. Being someone who loves animals, I rented &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot; and &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot; just for the heck of it (the former because I think Jim Carrey is hilarious but had avoided that particular title out of fear of it being a disappointment, the latter because I was interested in seeing the talking animal effects). After loving the first title far better than expected, I had the pleasure of writing it up with compliments here for other IMDb readers.\n\n &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot;, however, was a flop for me.\n\nNow, I do have to admit that I was basically prepared to be disappointed for this one the same way I was with &quot;When Nature Calls&quot;. I grew up with the beloved original &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; movie starring the talented Rex Harrison and adored the original books. I was absolutely convinced that this movie would be a dumb attempt to cash in on the original and make it &quot;marketable&quot; and &quot;hip&quot; in that lousy, gross-out way that only Hollywood marketing executives can when digging for dollars. But I watched it anyway, hoping that I could at least enjoy the talking animals, and I would have been spared a lot of headaches if only someone had been around to talk me out of this temporary lapse of better judgement.\n\nLet me start by saying that this movie has nothing to do with the original concept. Nothing. The animals talk and the main character has a famous name along with the ability to understand them, and it&apos;s there that any similarities end.\n\nHow bad was this film? Let me put it this way: it was a heap worse than I had anticipated, so much so that I shut it off two-thirds of the way in. It was simply too much of an embarrassment, and I found myself plotting to return it in the middle of the night after work when Blockbuster would be closed so no one would see me carrying it!\n\nThe absolute worst problem with this film has to do with Eddie Murphy himself--a strong reminder of why he didn&apos;t have a hit film for something going on a decade. Simply put, he isn&apos;t likeable: he plays this role the precise same way he has played nearly all of his roles, as an obnoxious &quot;Why do I have to be stuck in this position, I wish I was doing something else better with my time&quot; jerk who merely puts up with his dilemma. He also seems so ANNOYED in most of his movies.\n\nIn the grossly overrated &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; films, he was an annoyed cop who had to have everything his own way. In &quot;The Golden Child&quot;, he was an annoyed locator of missing children who put up with his job as well as his mission simply because he was stuck with it. Except for the occasional &quot;Mulan&quot; (the only performance of his I liked, by the way), he always whines, snarls, screams, curses and is generally pessimistic. And in this film, he is annoyed at the mere idea of being the world&apos;s most unique animal doctor.\n\nEddie Murphy has managed to accomplish the impossible here--he has actually managed to make the idea of being able to talk to animals into a thoroughly unenjoyable and miserable routine. Simply put, he takes all the fun out of such a concept.\n\nWhat child HASN&apos;T wanted to talk to animals? It was the one thing I wished I could do for as long as I could remember. If given the choice of any one magical ability (even if I were to include the ability to fly in a would-be list to choose from), it would easily be being able to converse with animals. But here, you get the impression that God simply plopped this amazing talent on precisely the wrong individual. Murphy doesn&apos;t even seem to genuinely *care* about animals--it&apos;s all an &quot;Okay, okay, I&apos;ll do it, but only because I feel like I have to and not because I have any heart for it&quot; sort of arrangement for him. All the while, what with that expression on his face, you keep expecting him to mutter, &quot;God, why ME? This is such a pain in the NECK!!!&quot; And in this attitude while conversing with the various animals on screen, he does everything except slap them with his &quot;I&apos;m always right, so you&apos;d better listen to me&quot; sharpness.\n\nThere is something seriously wrong with a script when Dr. Dolittle is overly annoyed in dealing with, much more so being the only person on the planet able to talk to, animals.\n\nHere&apos;s my say: if this material had to be remade at all, it should have at least been given to a comedian who could have worked wonders with its concept and genuinely enjoyed it. Imagine Robin Williams, or Steve Martin, or (you guessed it) even Carrey himself portraying this role. Heck, even the late John Candy. Any of them as well as dozens of others could have made this work because they have something which Murphy has always lacked--a sense of lightheartedness and joy when given the opportunity to work with fantastical and outlandish material.\n\nWatching this dreck, though, I seriously get the impression that Eddie Murphy picked the project simply because he knows he had nearly killed his own career with portraying annoyingly selfish, self-centered bores and wanted to do something to change his image into something lighter in an attempt to save it. Or at least his agent did. Whatever. All I have to say is--Eddie, if you want to convince us you can do something fun then you need to lighten yourself up first. Talking animal effects and potty humour do no automatically make you a whiz at family entertainment. Basically, you&apos;re just doing your same old &quot;Beverly Hills Cop personality&quot; routine with gimmicky windowdressing, and it doesn&apos;t work.\n\nBut such a long review on my behalf was far better than this film deserves. If it weren&apos;t for the fact that I wanted to share my feelings on it with others, I would have otherwise simply written one line here: &quot;I&apos;ll pass on this movie.&quot;"

I have always liked these pieces of music but to hear them together, in an up front way was special. I also loved Moonrise Kingdom for its extended use of Benjamin Britten.\n\n*End Credits - worth watching as they tastefully but playfully hold your attention.\n\n* Costumes and sets - as always of the highest quality * Colour Pallette - the most confectionary-like cinema has ever been; a mixture of stop animation, play within a film and situationist comedy.\n\nIt&apos;s easy to dismiss Wes Anderson films as being all the same but if this were the only film he&apos;d made it would easily be the best of the year so far. Only because we as viewers have limited memory to store a few classics by each filmmaker, unfortunately Anderson&apos;s last few films have been slightly overlooked.",

Rohan&apos;s journey after being expelled from boarding school in the city of Jamshedpur working under his tyrant father and the way his character evolves simply touches your heart. Little bit of one liners shared between Rohan and his friends stay with you. Rohan&apos;s younger step brother is absolutely fabulous and even if he spoke barely few dialogues in the movie, he made an impact by his sly little demeanors. Character of ultra strict father played by Ronit Roy is so well crafted and acted that it is very much believable. To top it all, amazing music from Amit Trivedi gels so well into the movie that it lifts the spirits up by tons. At the end, kudos to the whole team for delivering such a lovely work.",

      "reviewBody": "In terms of bankable movie experiences, you can seldom go wrong with a  Tom Hanks movie can you? While there are a few pages in his portfolio  he might prefer to forget (&quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; anyone?) his  movies are nearly all eminently watchable. And &quot;A Hologram for the  King&quot; puts him into what might be deemed a &apos;preferred&apos; character role  for his acting style  an every-man in a strange land facing trials and  tribulations with hearty American bonhomie.  But here it doesn&apos;t really work, and it&apos;s not even Hanks&apos; fault.  Hanks plays struggling salesman Alan who is given a do-or-die mission  to sell one of his company&apos;s holographic videoconferencing systems to  the King of Saudi Arabia as a way into winning a big IT supply contract  for a new desert city being constructed. Promising his bosses success,  he arrives to find a deflated demonstration team struggling to put on a  show with the lack of the basic essentials: wi-fi; air-con; food! Alan  has to battle with both local custom and obstructive secretaries to try  to save the day, helped by his driver Yousef (newcomer Alexander  Black).   Adding extra pressure to the mix is his marital status - Alan is  recently divorced, and needing to financially support his daughter Kit  (Tracey Fairaway) through college - and an alarming cyst that has  suddenly appeared on his back. The latter requires the tender care of  local doctor Zara (Sarita Choudhury, possibly best known as Saul&apos;s wife  from &quot;Homeland&quot;) and an unlikely cross-cultural friendship is struck  up.  I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, partly because I  like Tom Hanks and partly because of the quirky Talking Heads &quot;Once in  a Lifetime&quot; rendition in the trailer (which actually opens the film,  and is great  I loved it). There are also a host of enjoyable episodic  plot elements set against spectacular Arabian vistas that are  memorable. However, that is all they are  episodes. Unfortunately, the  whole film is a jumble of tidbits that never gel into any sort of  satisfactory story arc: We have an &quot;infidel in the middle of Mecca&quot;  scene, that suddenly ends without event or note; We head off on a wolf  hunt that subsides into well, I have no idea what: perhaps the  denouement was supposed to mean something deep and meaningful, but it  meant nothing to me; Even the main storyline tends to fizzle out to be  replaced with an aquatic-based sub-story of inter-racial love. True  that this romance is both touching and well done, but it feels entirely  bolted on at the point you expect the film to end - it really doesn&apos;t  integrate well.   Blame for this must rest with writer/director Tom Twyker (&quot;Run Lola  Run&quot; and the almost impenetrable Hanks movie &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;, which I  must admit I never got to the end of on a plane!) I think Hanks should  consider playing the &quot;two strikes and you&apos;re out&quot; card with this  director.   Hanks and Choudrey are fine in their leading roles, and the film really  comes alive in the scenes between Hanks and Alexander Black as Yousef -  his &quot;driver, guide, hero!&quot;. There is really good chemistry between  them, and although Black is a little too American- looking to genuinely  pass as an Arab, he is effective and is probably the &apos;find&apos; of the  film.  Sidse Babett Knudsen (from TV&apos;s &quot;Borgen&quot;) is also very attractive and  personable as the sex-starved Danish contractor Hanne. Also watch out  for cameo&apos;s from Tom Skeritt and Ben Wishaw.  But the acting talent - however hard they try - and the glorious  cinematography (by Twyker regular Frank Griebe) can&apos;t make up for the  erratic screenplay. This is a real shame, since the storyline around  battling the adverse conditions of software demonstration abroad is a  good one. As someone who used to work for IBM and did many  demonstrations of this type in trade shows in far flung places in the  Middle East, the Far East, Africa and South America, I have shared  their pain, and it is enough to drive you to despair and madness. An  opportunity squandered.",

They only added a mild comic subplot but didn&apos;t affect the telling in any way. Every time I hear THC&apos;s voice, I always see his character from Wings blabbering on about something mundane!

Her anger and sadness come to the surface even when she&apos;s silent.

It takes time to develop and meanders a bit in the process but again it&apos;s part of what makes the film seem so genuine. Though the premise of the story is a bit ridiculous in itself it&apos;s really just a vehicle to let us in on the behavior of these young people. What makes them tick. What kind of music they like. How they relate to each other.\n\nClearly this film isn&apos;t for everyone. You should have an idea what it is about before you partake in the investment of watching it. But if you are like me and enjoy the sociological aspect of feeling like you are eavesdropping on the life of these young people then it&apos;s a great film.\n\nI&apos;m not familiar with this director but now I&apos;d like to see her other films. Hopefully her hand is on the pulse of a lot of different subsets of culture.",

(Seriously, just go count how many butt hurt Ex Machina reviewers you can spot here. It&apos;s annoying, guys.)\n\nI&apos;ll simply say this:\n\n1. It&apos;s a decent movie, on it&apos;s own, and deserves a watch. \n\n2. It&apos;s listed as a Horror movie. It is not a horror movie. \n\n3. I guess some of the acting could be better. Overall, it&apos;s really not that bad. \n\n4. It has elements that Ex Machina lacked. It&apos;s fast-paced and there are actual action scenes. It&apos;s not as drawn out either. \n\n5. I am disappointed that Paul Giamatti only appears in one scene. Also, Taylor-Joy was an interesting choice for Morgan. I look forward to seeing her in the upcoming Split.",

      "reviewBody": "In terms of content, it&apos;s hard not to like MILLION DOLLAR ARM. There&apos;s a winning performance from Jon Hamm as the harassed agent trying his best to re-establish himself, while discovering the importance of looking after his charges; complemented by Lake Bell as the next- door neighbor, the intern who understands more about the young Indian boys&apos; predicament of inhabiting a completely alien culture. As the two boys, Suraj Sharma and Madhur Mittal are particularly good at communicating - often through nonverbal means - their sheer bewilderment once they are transplanted from their rural Indian surroundings to metropolitan Los Angeles. Although they eventually make a success of their quest to become major league baseball pitchers, they nonetheless find it difficult to adapt to alien surroundings.\n\nAnd yet there is a strong sense in which Craig Gillespie&apos;s film serves to perpetuate rather than negotiate stereotypes about the Indian nation and its people, and the Americans&apos; responses to it. Hamm&apos;s JB is predictably confused by the disorganized ways in which the Indian people do business, especially in his interactions with Vivek (Darshan Jariwala). By implication, therefore, the American (i.e. efficient) ways, are naturally superior. Meanwhile aging coach Ray (Alan Arkin) rejects the Indian way of life altogether, as he complains about the prospect of contracting the so-called &quot;Delhi belly&quot; (an upset stomach), and returns to America on the first available flight.\n\nOnce the Indian boys are transplanted to the United States, they are frequently used as butts for cheap jokes; there is one scene in a hotel, where they experience problems with the elevator, which is particularly orientalist in tone. The film seems not to be aware of contemporary realities; in economic terms India is no longer a backward country but gradually becoming an economic superpower in its own right. \n\nNonetheless the film does make an effort to recognize the strengths of Indian cultures; the emphasis on family stability and the ability to converse contrasts starkly with JB&apos;s life, in which he is so busy that he has little time either to consider marriage or even to talk to anyone at length. The Indian characters also take time for daily prayers; the contemplative life is as significant as the active life in human beings. Perhaps the western world has become too secular to understand this.\n\nMILLION DOLLAR ARM is an ambivalent piece, at once celebratory of yet still reluctant to recognize the strength of contemporary Indian cultures. Yet it&apos;s still worth a look.",

      "reviewBody": "I had seen many good reviews for this film but was reluctant at first to watch it as I thought it could be just one of the high art movies which seem to be made for the development of cinematography alone rather than enjoyment of the public and which I find hard to like even though I appreciate them. \n\nI watched &quot;The Return&quot; on DVD and I truly think it is special and is very absorbing as well as highly intelligent. I just wish I went to see it in the cinema on the big screen when I had a chance, because the film&apos;s cinematography is exceptional and nature views play as big part in the film as actors themselves do. I can close my eyes and still see the lakes, the forest, the vast empty spaces. The film left me feeling elated and clean. \n\nI loved the structure of the film, so different to the usual Hollywood movie: nothing is explained and you can think for yourselves. Also I could not guess the ending.\n\nThe story is simple  the father of two boys was absent for twelve years (he probably was in the prison camp - this is one of the places I can think of where you could be fed a poor diet of fish).The mother never told the boys the truth about him .The father comes back, wants his boys to accept him as the father figure and help them to learn how to survive in this world, but the misunderstanding and flaws in his character play their role. \n\nBehind the story many spiritual (and other) layers hide.. One quote comes to mind  that the prophets are never accepted by their own people. Or other layer - Russia itself is often viewed as a parent for its people . The country had a terrible 70-80 years recently when it really was a big prison camp. Now some of the Russian people feel estranged, unloved and sometimes betrayed by their country.\n\nIt is pity that because the film was in Russian language with English subtitles, some meaning was &quot;lost in translation&quot;. I am of the Russian origin and noticed some discrepancies in the subtitles. But it must be very difficult to translate the film like this as there are not many words in it and they often have second-layer meaning. \n\nThe director Andrei Zvyagintsev must be really congratulated on such a great debut, a masterpiece accomplished on a very low budget. \n\nThe casting is absolutely perfect  the child actors even look very much as their parents. Vanya looks like his mother, has a personality similar to her, is close to her, where Andrei looks like the father and has more of the father&apos;s tough personality. They both are exceptional actors, especially for their age. When you watch the film you don&apos;t see the acting, you see the real boys almost like they were filmed by a hidden camera.\n\nKonstantin Lavronenko did a particular good job of depicting very complicated personality of the father. Everything is there  pain of the wasted years, love for the boys deeply hidden, scars that some very hard life path left and all this behind the tough facade.\n\nI give this movie 10/10",

For example, peolpe seem to know a dance routine by looking at it once.\n\n\n\n* The plot is unoriginal, you know where &quot;Honey&quot; is heading.\n\n\nSummary: &quot;Honey&quot; is a likeable film, but you have to enjoy listening to hip hop and watch people dance.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the sort of movie I can watch over and over. In one word I would say it is clever. A combination of mystery, suspense, drama, and Allen&apos;s ingenious humor, Manhattan Murder Mystery is my favorite Woody Allen movie. Perhaps my favorite movie - period. The plot was fresh, and having such humor with suspense is just too good. Another quality I enjoy in this movie is how Allen avoids an &quot;over-polished&quot; look. For instance, the scene where a neighbor in the hallway asks Paul about a rent increase. The actor appears to stumble for the right word, but Allen let the scene go that way giving it a very natural look. The restaurant scenes also portray realism with multiple conversations at one time; a quality I love in all of his movies. This makes reviewing the movies interesting- you pick up something new each time you watch it! Woody Allen&apos;s style is definitely an intelligent humor.",

She brings just the right balance of elfin enthusiasm and borderline adulthood to the crucial role. Zach Mills as Eric,who collects hats, sparkles throughout. Jason Bateman as the &quot;mutant&quot; never overplays his part.\n\nIf every life is a performance, this movie is an exceptional reminder of the need to live life with joy and gusto, to play every day, and make the world a brighter place.",

The frustrating thing they didn&apos;t even have to take a chance, the book is over a 150 years old, there was a blockbuster stage show and 2 blockbuster films, all they had to do was minorly tweak the original book, or use one of the smash-hit films as a guide. I venture to say Ben Hur is one of our great stories, it has everything, love, spectacle, honour, adventure, redemption, meaning, a moral, and even a miracle&apos; where could you go wrong. But wrong they went and I was never so angry and disappointed at a film and it was all down to ineptitude and pure genius at incompetence I mean how could anyone spend 100 million on Ben Hur and get it so wrong, the mind boggles. I give it 4 stars as the 2 great iconic scenes of which we all know, the Naval battle and the Chariot race were quite good. But the story around those events, the iconic Ben Hur story was complete and utter motiveless drivel.",

It has a lot of action, but in a comical way that does not feel too violent. I don&apos;t even recall seeing blood in any scenes. It has messages about love and family, which is actually touching. The plot may be formulaic, that you know what will happen in the whole film just after watching twenty minutes, but it is still enjoyable and fun. It&apos;s a nice piece of entertainment into fun and laughter."

      "reviewBody": "Haunted Mansion is the 2023 Reboot of the famous spooky Disney ride. It follows around a single mother recruiting people to help her exorcise the ghosts from her mansion. The main focus of the story is on LaKeith Stanfield, a paranormal guide with a tragic past. I love KaKeith as an actor and he carries this movie. He is the emotional center of the story and he brought his &quot;A&quot; game to a movie that he didn&apos;t have to try as hard. I got a little teared up a couple of times because of him. The rest of the cast is ok. They mostly serves as comic relief and certain roles for the team and plot. The story is good. They actually have a great explanation on why the family doesn&apos;t just leave the mansion. The villain and ghost are great. If you are a fan of the ride, there are a lot of references and nodes but none of them feel really forced. This is a nice fun movie that should be near Halloween, not sure why they released it in July. I enjoyed this way more than the Eddie Murphy movie. Kids will have fun with it and adults can enjoy it too around Halloween.",

The movie&apos;s special effects still looked good to me, especially the &quot;Star Car&quot; (my personal favorite).\n\nBut the special effects are not the centerpiece of this film. It has plenty of charm of its own to offer in plot, story, warmth, humor &amp; good performances.  Craig Safan&apos;s music score for this film is one of my all-time favorites.  It almost outsizes this movie but it fits just the same.\n\n&quot;Starfighter&quot; is a real gem from the 80&apos;s I will treasure in my movie collection."

      "reviewBody": "A new evolution of horror as arrived with the new film, Teeth. Teeth tells the story of Dawn O&apos;Keefe (Jess Weixler), a young abstinent teenager who comes to find out that her &quot;family jewels&quot; are much more special than everyone else&apos;s; her vagina has teeth. When she comes to realize her &quot;differences&quot; she starts to battle with her sexuality and wanting to act on her impulses.\n\nThis has definitely revolutionized the horror genre along with some awkward comedy, Teeth holds interest for the viewer throughout. From a woman&apos;s perspective I&apos;m not sure how the film would be received, but from a man, to put it plainly simple, it scares the ever living crap out of me. The film holds nothing to the imagination as it shows the most graphic images I&apos;ve seen on film in quite sometime.\n\nOther than graphic imagery, the storyline isn&apos;t as strong as images. There&apos;s no flow to the story and pretty random at times as it conquers the steps of gross and unfortunate adolescence. The performances are enough to suffice but its John Hensley who plays Brad, Dawn&apos;s perverted step-brother who wants to take his sister&apos;s virginity that stands out. Young Dawn takes on some new attitudes throughout the film and Weixler attends to her with grace and ease.\n\nNot sure if this is a must-see for people, but it compares to The Matrix scenario when Morpheus presents the red pill and the blue pill. You can take the blue pill, the dream ends and you can believe whatever you want to believe; you take the red pill, you get to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.\n\n**½ /****",

      "name": "This remake is largely inoffensive - which is probably its biggest problem.",
      "reviewBody": "Hollywood has been running out of ideas for years – remakes, sequels, prequels and reboots now seem to be the order of the day. What&apos;s hard to imagine is why anyone thought a remake of Endless Love was necessary in the first place. The 1981 film of the same name – based on a pulpy, albeit well-regarded, novel by Scott Spencer – wasn&apos;t even that good to begin with. At least that version of the story had the distinction of starring a young, nubile Brooke Shields, not to mention a title song that became more famous than the movie itself. This remake manages to be both extremely bland and painfully melodramatic, bled of almost any hint of controversy or genuine complexity and darkness.\n\nJade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) is the quintessential poor little rich girl: a beautiful, blonde ice princess who has shut herself in with her parents, Hugh (Bruce Greenwood) and Anne (Joely Richardson), after the untimely death of her brother Chris. David (Alex Pettyfer) is a kid from the poorer side of town who has nursed a crush on her throughout high school. She&apos;s college-bound, he just wants to work in his dad&apos;s (Robert Patrick) workshop. When they finally connect, sparks fly and Jade starts to re-think the safe, perfect future she&apos;s planned with Hugh.\n\nIt&apos;s all very cookie-cutter high-school romantic melodrama. Nothing about this film feels particularly fresh or smart, although it does start out a little better than you&apos;d expect. But, after the initial meet-cute between Jade and a thoroughly smitten David, Endless Love quickly descends into trashy predictability: Hugh does everything within his power to get rid of David, but the spark of love and lust between the star-crossed couple burns so hot and bright that nothing will stand in their way.\n\nWhat&apos;s frustrating is that the film has almost completely excised anything even remotely complex about its plot and characters. The 1981 movie may have been faintly terrible and soapy, but it at least made a stab at psychological darkness, suggesting that the &apos;endless love&apos; of the title bordered more on creepy, damaging obsession than sweet, romantic love. There&apos;s no such suggestion here: David is troubled but ultimately noble; Jade is purely, truly in love; and it&apos;s the curmudgeonly Hugh who must realise the errors of his ways.\n\nThe cast is watchable but not really memorable. Pettyfer broods as if he knows he&apos;s meant for better things. Wilde is effortlessly, often stunningly beautiful, but doesn&apos;t have much to offer beyond that. Greenwood has the most scenery to chew – he practically twirls an invisible moustache and cackles at some points – but it&apos;s Richardson who walks away with the film&apos;s few affecting moments (even though her character loses much of its shock value in morphing into the archetypal loyal, loving housewife).\n\nYou would imagine that, in a cinematic landscape overrun by remakes, these films would – at the minimum – have something interesting to say about the times in which we live now. They can make a case for their existence, perhaps, by being a little edgier than the original films: explaining why there&apos;s a need to tell this old story again. Endless Love doesn&apos;t really manage that. Instead, by forgoing depth and darkness for schmaltz and sentiment, it ends up being even safer and sweeter than a movie shot over thirty years ago.",

      "reviewBody": "Sadistic wealthy people always spell trouble for the downtrodden or down on their luck. 13 Tzameti, Hard Target and Hostel are all good examples of the wealthy torturing and killing the less fortunate for the purpose of their own entertainment.\n\nThe latest such cinematic example is Would You Rather. Starring Brittany Snow (Pitch Perfect), Sasha Grey (my personal hard drive), Robb Wells (Hobo with a Shotgun), and John Heard (Home Alone), Would You Rather gathers a group of strangers for a wealthy aristocrat, played by Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator) who pits his guests against each other in sadistic games where they have to choose between two options – each of which can either cause pain or death to themselves or another guest.\n\nSo guests are put in awkward positions of having to decide whether to electrocute themselves or someone else or whether to whip a guest or stab another. Attempt to leave the game and you will be shot. Take too long to decide on the lesser of the two options and you will be killed. The goal is to become the last person standing and the reward differs on the needs of each individual.\n\nThe main character to which the movie focuses around the table is Iris (Snow). She agrees to be part of the unrevealed game in an effort to provide for her ailing brother. She is the first to be tested with an offer to eat portions of a steak in return for $1,000 (being a vegetarian, it was a tough decision). But as the evening draws further, Iris and the others will be forced to make decisions inflicting unspeakable pain towards the other participants.\n\nStealing the movie is Combs. He commands a presence at the top of the table and his evil is believable in large thanks to his charismatic and demented portrayal of sadistic Shepard Lambrick.\n\nThe movie doesn&apos;t offer a lot of &apos;What would you do in the same situation&apos;? There is little hope or much choice as the game progresses. Still, the script by Steffen Schlachtenhaufen (Primal) is interesting enough in various character developments.\n\nNot likely to make many Top 10 lists by year&apos;s end, Would You Rather still offers valued entertainment and a few good self-inflicted wounds along the way. \n\nwww.killerreviews.com",

She cheats, leads people on, verbally abuses people, doesn&apos;t own up when she&apos;s in the wrong, rebukes, and criticizes, and we&apos;re supposed to be rooting for this girl? Seriously, why does the male lead like her so much? If a character is going to be that flawed, she has to be likable to redeem herself to the viewer.

She has redeeming qualities in the book.)",

How crazy can they become? How thin is the line between love and craziness? This is a film when the roles of good and bad change really quickly, and when you start making your own conclusions on the topic, suddenly something happens and you instantly change the course of your thoughts, seeing someone else as &quot;the bad guy&quot;. I really, really loved this film! I think it&apos;s a great thriller and it sure kept me interested till the very end. Don&apos;t you dare miss it!"

      "name": "Perhaps the greatest postwar animated film",
      "reviewBody": "The short version: &apos;The Secret of NIMH&apos; isn&apos;t just a masterpiece: it&apos;s the best classically animated film since the early 40&apos;s. It&apos;s up there with &apos;Bambi&apos;, which is to say, this is about as good as it gets.\n\nI remember walking down the street when I was about 19, and seeing the poster for &apos;The Secret of NIMH&apos; up in a theatre, and immediately thinking &quot;This film is going to blow my mind.&quot; A week later, I was sitting in an empty theatre, watching the last credits rolling down the screen after everybody else had left, and the house lights were up, thinking &quot;yep.&quot;\n\nA bit of history is probably in order for a film of this importance. Flashback to about 1980. Disney animator Don Bluth walks out, halfway through production on &apos;The Fox and the Hound&apos;, taking several other key animators with him, and declaring that he was going to recapture the spirit of classical animation, which Disney had forgotten about.\n\nNearly three years later, NIMH debuts. Critically it is well received, but lack of distribution and advertising means it&apos;s swamped by such an historical non-entity as Disney&apos;s &apos;Tron&apos;. Accepting an animation award for best film, Bluth remarked &quot;Thanks. We didn&apos;t think anyone had noticed.&quot;\n\nNIMH is a glorious achievement. It puts to shame anything which Disney had done for a quarter century, and singlehandedly did exactly what Bluth set out to do. It revived the spirit of classical animation, and at the same time it proved that there was room on the block for another player than Disney - not an unimportant fact when you consider that at the time there was no Dreamworks or Pixar, and no feature animation section in Universal or MGM.\n\nAs to the film itself: from the first moment you are treated to a gloriously rich, sumptuous, seamless animation and background art, the likes of which hadn&apos;t been seen since Disney&apos;s war years. Particularly stunning is the movie&apos;s use of colour to enhance moods. The dark blues and blacks of the stunning &apos;lantern elevator&apos; descent into the rats&apos; city, and the tractor scene - the background starts out in subdued tones and ends up flaming red as the action peaks. One reviewer at the time wrote &quot;I felt as if I was watching the invention of color, as if I was being drawn into the depths of the screen.&quot;\n\nThe characters are beautifully conceived and drawn, and the voice characterisations are spot-on (including the animation debut of Dom de Luise as Jeremy). And, significantly, there is only one song, and it&apos;s not sung by a character (significantly, &apos;Balto&apos;, one of the few animated films since which can hold a candle to NIMH, followed the same principal). Jerry Goldsmith&apos;s score supplies the emotional power for the rest of the soundtrack.\n\nEven more importantly though, the film is incredibly emotionally potent, and not in a sentimental, kiddy way. It has genuine choke-you-up power which will appeal to adults. \n\nBluth ditched the double storyline of the book, relegating Jonathan Brisby&apos;s more substantial role in the novel to a short piece of background information revealed in an explanatory flashback. Personally I think this was the right decision. To do otherwise would have been to take the spotlight off Mrs Brisby, and probably diminish the film&apos;s coherence and power. \n\nSo, Don Bluth achieved his goal: his debut feature film was the greatest animated achievement in 40 years. Sadly, it was also his only masterpiece. He peaked on his first outing, and afterwards declined into mediocrity, while Disney picked itself up and overtook him. In fact, ironically, there were signs of this in &apos;The Fox and the Hound&apos;, which despite being plagued by Bluth&apos;s departure amongst other catastrophes, turned out to be Disney&apos;s best movie since the 60&apos;s, even if it would still be the better part of another decade before they started hitting their marks consistently.\n\nToday NIMH enjoys the sort of cult following it deserves. It&apos;s just a damn shame that its greatness isn&apos;t more widely acknowledged, and an almost equally great shame that a generation later it was cursed with one of the most insulting, wretched sequels in cinematic history.\n\nIt&apos;s an important film, and it&apos;s a great film. In the two decades since it was released, only a small handful of animated films have approached its stature.",

      "reviewBody": "Another saturated topic, we typically get two or three WWII films a year. Frustratingly, this is another typical holocaust film and one that will not standout against the packed crowd. In saying that though, this is an excellent &quot;story&quot; film to which I was fully immersed. A factual fictionalisation of the Warsaw Zoo surviving WWII where both animals and humans are in danger. The owners soon start to hide Jewish residents within the zoo in an attempt to save their lives from the Nazi holocaust. I expected a film about zookeepers and nearby residents saving animals from Nazi capture, boy was I completely wrong. The zoo animals only take precedent during the first fifteen minutes, and then the narrative&apos;s focus is purely on the owners, Jews and the Nazi regime. Soul draining is how I would describe this. It&apos;s bleak, depressing and not an ounce of happiness until the last five minutes. Director Niki Caro captures the horror of the holocaust and does not shy away from the brutality of it. She evokes powerful imagery that isn&apos;t portrayed in the film, we see a young girl being taken into a tunnel by two Nazi soldiers. We don&apos;t see what happens, but the detail in every scene enables us to imagine the terror that unfolded. Another synonymous scene would be when Jewish children are carried onto a train. We know where it&apos;s going, but the story never informs us. It&apos;s subliminal, and that might be due to the over saturation of this genre. Jessica Chastain stars as the eponymous character in what is one of her more nuanced performances, but emotionally vulnerable. When she cries, my God I feel it. Daniel Brühl was also captivating as the Nazi zoologist. Would I have liked the focus to be strictly on the zoo animals? Yes. It would&apos;ve been different, less generic and perhaps more emotive. Can I complain about what was presented instead? No. A perfectly good WWII drama that is harrowingly depressing which will not set the cinematic world alight.",

      "reviewBody": "Steeped in dark, grim &amp; brooding atmosphere yet failing to capitalise on it to fully realise its ambitions, Antlers begins on a promising note but it doesn&apos;t take long for the film to devolve into a frustrating slog. It tries to be too many things yet doesn&apos;t have the discipline or clarity to deliver the desired goods. There is plenty it wants to say yet has no idea how to articulate it right.\n\nCo-written &amp; directed by Scott Cooper (Black Mass), the story does create the right sort of intrigue with its foreboding mystery but the human drama that unfolds is not only bland but also inauthentic. Cooper is unsure of what road to take and plays with several ideas hoping some would somehow stick. The balance between its genre elements is off, and the themes aren&apos;t properly handled either.\n\nOn the plus side, the creature design, gore effects &amp; moody camerawork is worth a mention but the plot &amp; characters don&apos;t have that gripping quality to it that would make us care. Still, the actors do what they can to make the journey worthwhile but it doesn&apos;t amount to a lot in the end. The problem lies with the script itself that required more fine-tuning to figure out its identity and what themes to address or discard.\n\nOverall, Antlers strives to be a supernatural horror rooted in indigenous folklore, an allegory about unresolved trauma, drug addiction &amp; child abuse, and also an environmental parable, all at the same time, yet falls remarkably short on nearly all fronts. Its premise had potential but its execution is dry &amp; directionless, thus resulting in a tedious &amp; disappointing genre fare that in an effort to say several things ends up saying nothing at all."

Director Kathryn Bigelow went on to produce Aliens and direct Blue Steel and Point Blank, while writer Eric Red went on to direct the brilliant but rarely-glimpsed Coen and Tate, an equally dark movie. In this stylish tale of modern-day vampires, gothic horror is mixed with modern-day American society. The hero, Caleb, is plunged into a shadowy world of immortal vampires that exists just below the ordinary world as the bad guys imitate modern mortals to hunt their prey. With atmospheric music by German techno-band Tangerine Dream, an impressive and evocative horror film with the added attraction that it features my favourite actress, Jenny Wright!"

I feel maybe they spent too much time giving nods to classic films, rather than making the story more interesting.\n\nThe style was ok, but I agree it looked like early 2000&apos;s dreamworks. Not 2D enough like Princess and the frog, and not 3D enough like the more recent films.\n\nRalph Breaks the Internet was a better nod to classic Disney than this film.",

So I rented Big Mama&apos;s House and was sorely disappointed, I was really nervous and was thinking that maybe I didn&apos;t want to see the second one. But my friend insisted that I see it and to give it a shot.\n\nMalcom is back and this time he&apos;s a safety teacher who has felt like he&apos;s lost his edge, but he has made a promise to his wife since she is pregnant. But when he finds out there is an investigation on a top secret defense CD being released to some very bad men, he goes undercover as Big Mama to be the man who has the CD and his family. He lies to his wife and work and the family he is caring for, but ends up saving the day for everyone.\n\nI have to say that I honestly laughed a lot more in the second Big Mama&apos;s House more than the first one. This one seemed just more light hearted and it was fun, despite it being predictable, I think more should give this movie a better chance, because in my opinion this was better and well thought out more than the first.\n\n5/10",

      "reviewBody": "*****SPOILERS***** People who go to Woody Allen&apos;s films should know by now that Allen is an agnostic when it comes to God, and a skeptic when it comes to anything &quot;supernatural&quot;, especially &quot;New Agey&quot; beliefs. That doesn&apos;t stop him from using God, religion, and New Age beliefs in his films. In &quot;Alice&quot;, one of Allen&apos;s best films, he uses a lot of &quot;New Agey&quot; beliefs and supernatural events. Those people posting here who think that Allen is &quot;endorsing&quot; fortune-telling, psychics, and reincarnation are WAY off track. Allen is using those things to compare and contrast the &quot;ordinary&quot; beliefs and actions of &quot;ordinary&quot; people. The husband, daughter, and son-in-law think that the wife/mother/mother-in-law is &quot;delusional&quot; because she believes in fortune-telling and reincarnation. BUT, does she REALLY believe in those things? Or, does she pretend to because it helps her to &quot;get what she wants&quot; and the &quot;blame&quot; goes to the fortune-teller friends and/or her own &quot;nuttiness&quot;? She doesn&apos;t want to lend her ungrateful daughter even MORE money------blame the fortune-teller. She wants to criticize her son-in-law for wasting his life trying to become a famous writer instead of becoming a doctor------that&apos;s what the fortune-teller said. She knows these kinds of things still &quot;sting&quot; her ungrateful family members, but it&apos;s not because SHE is being critical or mean------the fortune-teller is saying these things! She would rather be thought of as &quot;nutty&quot; than &quot;judgmental and selfish&quot;. And, she knows her husband is the &quot;nutty&quot; and delusional one-----he thinks he can stop the aging process and death by working out at the gym and marrying a woman young enough to be his grand-daughter. The daughter is delusional because she thinks her boss has romantic feelings for her when he has never said or done anything to give that impression. The son-in-law is delusional because he thinks he is a great writer and thinks he can actually get away with passing someone else&apos;s writing off as his own. All these &quot;delusions&quot; are &quot;ordinary&quot; ones that humans have All The Time, so we don&apos;t recognize them as &quot;delusions&quot;. We save that judgment for the &quot;real nutty&quot; things like psychics and reincarnation. Allen says, why are some delusions &quot;nutty&quot; but others aren&apos;t? Well, I guess our OWN delusions are NOT nutty, but other people&apos;s delusions ARE nutty. Does that make us delusional? Nutty? Or Human?",

It seems like the actors are all trying their best, but when the material is just so painfully unfunny and sort of embarrassing at times, there&apos;s so much one can do. It&apos;s not all bad though, there&apos;s some few delightful, funny, or entertaining scenes. But yeah, this is a huge disappointment. I just don&apos;t even know what to say, this is just stupid humor we&apos;ve come to expect from bad writing, not the kind the show mostly had. At worse, this is grating. At its best, it&apos;s mildly amusing, just mildly. Yeah, I just can&apos;t recommend this at all."

    "summary": "Reviewers say 'Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Movie: Infinity Castle' has exceptional animation, emotional storytelling, and thrilling action sequences. Many reviewers highlight the film's stunning visuals and intricate fight choreography, noting that it sets a new standard for anime cinema. The emotional depth of the narrative, particularly in character moments and the exploration of themes like loss and revenge, has resonated deeply with audiences. However, some reviewers point out issues with pacing and the reliance on flashbacks, which they feel disrupt the flow of the story. Despite these minor criticisms, the overwhelming consensus is that \"Infinity Castle\" is a must-watch for fans of the series and a significant achievement in the world of anime.",

Now that said, this isn&apos;t the worst offender out of them like certainly the scary movie type comedies, it&apos;s got some realism to it and some semblance of reality.\n\nThe most important thing is that its a funny movie, it has lots of jokes, lots of jokes, some funnier than others, but overall I&apos;d say more of the jokes land and are funny.\n\nIt&apos;s also got some nice story, nothing special, but it&apos;s a nice feel good story with a bit of romantic parts and stuff. All of the actors are great, each and every one of them is funny in their own way,\n\nI enjoyed the movie and had quite a few laughs, definitely worth seeing if you like the silly type comedies. Recently with mr. English and this I feel like comedies are coming back a little.",

      "reviewBody": "First off I just want to say that this is my first review of any film. I attended the world premiere of Maggie last night at the Tribeca Film Festival and I am also a huge Arnold fan. It was great seeing him perform in a different (dramatic) role. \n\nThe cinematography in this film was absolutely stunning. From the location setting, the small town, old house; it was all well put together. I thought the cast was great and Arnold did a great job in his role but this film was focused on Abigail Breslin. And she stole the show. She outperformed the rest of the cast and made each viewer connected to her character very closely. Abigail had many scenes alone in this film and without giving too much away, there were times you can feel her pain and sort of understand what she was experiencing as the film progressed. \n\nMaggie really shed new light to the zombie genre because it showed intimately how a family member was deeply affected by an outbreak. A father and daughter bond filled with love and courage and the chemistry played on screen between Arnold and Abigail was fantastic. Each character showed great passion throughout the film and it was well directed by Henry Hobson, his directorial debut. \n\nI recommend this film to viewers who are interested in character development, great cinematography, a well written script, and a solid meaningful ending. Please don&apos;t come into this movie expecting The Walking Dead/ Zombieland type of action film because this isn&apos;t it. Hopefully Arnold will take on more of these roles in the future and from what we saw in Maggie, Abigail has a great career ahead of her. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes a movie is a record of events, a record of the truth, which lifts its importance higher than mere entertainment. There have been some notable films about real events, history changing events, and beyond the independently high value of each film, none have come close to All the President&apos;s Men (1976).\n\nThere comes a moment in every film about journalism, that the size of the shark is revealed. In All the President&apos;s Men it is towards the end: &quot;everyone is involved (...) your lives are in danger&quot;. In Spotlight (2015) it&apos;s when they realize the number of abusive priests, in Boston alone, is not five or six but over ninety. In She Said (2022) the size of the shark is revealed at the historical notes just before the end credits.\n\nShe Said, may not be about a crook of a US President or the systemic cover-up of abuse by the Catholic church, but it is about something that reaches far and wide in every corner of life and of the workplace: the abuse of women and the abusers&apos; standard defense that the victims are making it up, and then paying them off for their silence.\n\nAlthough the pace of the movie is slow and low key, like any investigative journalism is in real life, I would have wanted a few points of punctuation where we instantly realize we are going to need a bigger boat. Yes, such real-life points have been accurately transferred to the screen in She Said, but you have to look for them, they don&apos;t jump out at you, and if you are already sleeping you might miss them. This admittedly very well-made movie could do with a little more catering to audiences that need to be pinched awake once in a reel or so.\n\nFor years now I have stopped re-watching Weinstein&apos;s excellent movies because they were made by a despicable creature who hurt human beings while making these excellent movies. No Weinstein re-runs for me. And kudos to the New York Times investigative reporters and to the New York Times for going after a world-renowned film producer and, in the beginning of the movie, going after a presidential candidate. The producer is now serving 23 years and the candidate got elected. I wonder how much of this movie was also about our society itself, that harbors such people and promotes them. And, speaking of society depicted on film, I wonder how many negative &quot;helpful&apos;s&quot; I&apos;ll get as punishment for my previous phrase.",

I have seen them but only recently and i thought they were both great but i don&apos;t have that nostalgic love for them like others.\n\nPeople who loved the old movies seem to hate these movies and i can agree. It wa very very basic. I know its a children&apos;s film but so were the 90s ones but they were wrote great, the actors were fab and this is just chock full of things i hate about recent children&apos;s movies like stupid pop culture things, over use of phones and like social media. I get it these are big things for kids but it is so pandering and you can tell its like an adult writing it that&apos;s like &quot;You know what kids love Tock Tic and Twittergram so lets have people in the movie love social media and instead of people using an actual on fire touch in a mob scene lets have them have pictures of lit torches on their phones because kids will find that hilarious&quot;.\n\nThe other issue plaguing children&apos;s movies these days which this movies suffers from is stunt casting. I get it, it helps sell tickets but some of the voices just don&apos;t work. Finn Wolfhard just doesn&apos;t fit well as the voice of Puglsey and he isn&apos;t the only one i didn&apos;t enjoy Nick Kroll as Uncle Fester he was just annoying to me where as Christopher Lloyd makes him a loveable oaf-type.\n\nThis movie was also very unfunny. I know i am not the target audience but the jokes were just like ??? i can&apos;t imagine that people thought that they would be funny even to a child.\n\nIt is a children&apos;s film so i didn&apos;t expect much and its like fine. Your kids might like it especially if they have no reference for The Addams family prior. I do think people who like The Addams Family property will not like this film though as it removes the darkness and sarcastic nature of other incarnation and replaces it with a very basic story.",

      "reviewBody": "This remake doesn&apos;t get enough respect. George A. Romeo didn&apos;t get his original film copyrighted, so he ended up not making any money off the film because it wound up in the public domain. With this 1990 remake, he scripted a remake of his original film that&apos;s quite loyal to the original story and vision, but this time it&apos;s in color and amped up with plenty of gory and very realistic special effects. Of all the zombie movies ever made (and that&apos;s quite a few after the zombie film comeback following 28 DAYS LATER and THE WALKING DEAD), this film is the only one I can think of where the zombies really look like corpses (though the zombies on THE WALKING DEAD are quite good too). Romeo turned the directing reigns over to special effects maestro Tom Savini who does a fine job behind the camera. The special effects in the film are top-notch, AND even if Savini wasn&apos;t credited for the special effects or makeup on the film, his influence on capturing realistic corpses come to life cannot be denied. Tony &quot;Candyman&quot; Todd takes on the role of Ben, Patricia Tallman is Barbara, Tom Towles is a nicely obnoxious Mr. Cooper, and Bill Moseley is great as the short-lived Johnny. What&apos;s most fun about this film is how the story stays so loyal to the original film, outside of thankfully making Barbara a less helpless character, but that when the film deviates from the original for the last 25 minutes, it&apos;s kind of a mindblower for anyone who grew up repeatedly viewing the original film. It&apos;s like Romero added another half-hour of the story taking place after the events of the original film! On the downside, the film does feel rather stiff and even corny at times, but it&apos;s still one of the best zombie siege films out there.",

      "reviewBody": "A thief steals a stash of black diamonds and this accidentally involves his family in an international terrorist plot since the diamonds are not just your typical diamonds. He joins forces with a mysterious guy who is dressed in all black and can kick serious ass with his martial arts skills to set things right. And, of course, kill the bad guys.\n\nThe plot is pretty silly, but the action is decent so if you just want to see a cheesy action movie, this is a pretty good choice. However, the film tries hard to have a dramatic and thriller edge that is just laughable. It tries to go push itself into a larger scope by the end. That is where you&apos;ll either tell yourself that you enjoyed the movie, or whether the whole thing just crashed and burned for you. However there is a good array of stunts and Jet Li shows off what he does best (again). However, at the same time the some of the action scenes seem to beg you into thinking that they are good with their fast paced editing and slow mo that doesn&apos;t really manage to cover up much of their mediocrity.\n\nBasically it is just a direct-to-video action movie, but with star power. It was that, and only that, which provided it with its theater run. --- 5/10 \n\nRated R for violence and profanity",

      "name": "Brimstone is an interesting suspense thriller, a tale about survival and an ode to resistance made by an unusual female protagonist who refuses to have her will subjugated",
      "reviewBody": "The narrative is divided into four non-linear acts - three of them named after the titles of books of the Scriptures - that accompany the trajectory of violence that umbilical unites the lives of its two protagonists. Portraying, it can be said, his own conception of what hell would be, the Dutch director exposes a film with beautiful photography, beautiful performances and interesting narrative, although it lacks a bit of the metaphorical pretension that his script tries to convey.\n\nFortunately, this choice by Koolhoven was right to maintain a high level of interest in the viewer for practically the entire film, although the duration drags a little towards the end. Such a structure would also be useless if the director did not keep each chapter - which have totally different themes, actors, objectives and scenarios - in a strong and explicit unity. Balancing well the peculiarity of each part of Liz&apos;s life told in this way, the director manages to expose a whole highlighting the particularity of each part of the film. For such an admirable work, the use of different photographs, sometimes grayish, sometimes reddish, is only equal to the patience in the development of the characters. Whether in the brothel or with the pigs, the screenwriter manages to create a solid poetic unity, with rhymes and repetitions capable of merging every part of his protagonist&apos;s life, generating a constant evolution in our perception of what has already been seen. A prudent expansion that rests, certainly, on the shoulders of the excellent supporting cast, which runs through each arc dictating the tone of the film.\n\nBrimstone is an interesting suspense thriller set in an Western given over to barbarism, inhabited by cruel and misogynistic men, where all sorts of injustices are approaching women, sexually trafficked by their own relatives or by strangers as if they were products in the shelves (nothing very different from what still happens in many places), without anyone moving a straw to end it - and the few heroes who try to break the shackles of this chain of exploitation and violence do not experience the glamor of fiction: they are easily killed. And forgotten. Brimstone is a tale about survival and an ode to resistance made by an unusual female protagonist who refuses to have her will subjugated again and again in the face of the endless cruelty of a fanatical and sadistic persecutor. The violence is brutal, incessant and over-the-top, making the viewer uncomfortable at all times, but it&apos;s a device that serves the story rather than just being used to provoke shock.\n\nDutch director Martin Koolhoven&apos;s camera is sinuous, always on the lookout, observing events through windows, cracks and half-open doors. Its aesthetic is that of a thriller - and the versatility of the western merges with the genre naturally. The slow, sonorous footsteps on the wooden thresholds are repeated throughout the film; the compositions that begin showing the characters from the ground as well, as well as the sideways glances and the crooked silences. The use of traveling is constant, but imperceptible: the movements of approaching and closing the shots are subtle. Silent background entrances - always with little depth of field - are recurrent and competently establish an ambience of mystery and tension that keep the viewer attentive to every detail. Tom Holkenborg&apos;s soundtrack, full of choirs and strings - with an emphasis on the characteristic gravity of the cellos - creates a cautious gothic sound that raises the slowness of the film&apos;s cinematographic construction to its throes.\n\nThe script signed by Martin Koolhoven himself is essential in creating the thriller atmosphere. The idea of telling the story in four non-linear acts plays alongside the narrative, which is essentially allegorical, and details about Liz and the Reverend slowly unfold. Dakota Fanning is terrified when Guy Pearce&apos;s voice echoes through the church in the first few minutes of the work. She has her back to the pulpit, fixing her daughter&apos;s clothes, and the camera slowly pans around her face. Her desperation is palpable, but the mystery of the real reason for her primal fear won&apos;t be revealed anytime soon. The Liz who observes the Reverend&apos;s intimidating presence in her living room, frightened through the cracks in the doors, is the same Joanna who, at 12 years of age, fearfully observes the violence her mother suffers. Parallelism is frequent in the composition of the chapters, and the force of some gestures and movements will only be fully understood at the end, looking back.\n\nThe script work, however, does not go unscathed. Although Guy Pearce gives the reverend an instant gravity, facilitated by Koolhoven&apos;s dark costume and camera that transform him into a kind of incarnate and mysterious evil, the character himself suffers from a stereotype of fanaticism that constantly takes him out of any situation. Three-dimensionality capable of sustaining him as an iconic figure. It is true that the reverend is atrocious, despicable and frightening, but it is also true that his psychopathic and hypocritical conviction does not go much further than that, which makes him, at certain moments in the film, a kind of unstoppable exterminator.\n\nGuy Pearce takes the film for himself in the construction of an absolutely detestable and malevolent type of psychotic behavior and diabolical motivation. The Reverend has an extremely twisted and perverted view of Christianity, in which he seeks to validate (for himself) even sex with a child, and the monstrosity of his actions leads the character into an endless cycle of sin and violence. His persona seems to represent an ancient evil that walks the Earth as if he were the Devil incarnate that cannot be stopped by anyone. Pearce&apos;s performance is precise, with his husky voice and expressions that transition from apparent calm and benevolence to hatred and iniquity. The Reverend is a wolf in sheep&apos;s clothing - and the actor even howls insanely as he chases Liz and Sam. Dakota Fanning is another one that deserves applause, her character in almost the entire story communicates through signs and facial expressions, it&apos;s not something simple to do, but she does it in a way that we understand the intention and feelings of the character. His young version played by Emilia Jones also delivers a powerful performance for someone with little experience.\n\nThe film deals with religious fanaticism, misogyny and human self-improvement in a careful yet visceral way - the stomach-turning kind, almost literally. The right decision, in this sense, was to tell the story from the perspective of fragile Liz, something rarely seen in a western as brutal as this one. But what seems to be a great biblical metaphor in its beginnings falls, due to excessive pretension, in a beautiful journey of heroism and courage in the face of evil and suffering that permeate life, whether in the 19th or 21st century. Another important point to mention is that the plot is far from being a horror, many will be confused by the name Brimstone that it is about anything related to the supernatural, but nothing like that happens. The production focuses on a dramatic and intense thriller with a Western movie atmosphere, but the narrative doesn&apos;t stop shocking or bringing disturbing scenes.\n\nBrimstone is disturbing and extremely violent. Its sequels are uncomfortable and cause distress. It makes explicit certain sequences with a lot of graphics, but insinuates, much more than it shows, others even more atrocious. Hangings, tortures, suicides, intestines tied around the necks of half-dead victims, tongues cut out (when we discover what happened to make Liz lose her tongue, the sequence is shocking, but cloudy: it is a scene that disturbs, but is not shown in details), torn bodies fed to pigs, sexual assaults on children... there is all sorts of evil in the lawless land where Liz tries to escape the persecution of her ruthless tormentor. And executioner in the most perfect etymological meaning of the word.\n\nMany will complain about the two and a half hours of the film, I thought it was valid, of course there are some unnecessary plots, including one that I found completely uninteresting is the introduction of the character Samuel played by Kit Harington (Game Of Thrones), he even has some importance in the Liz&apos;s trajectory, but overall, her development was quite out of place. The last chapter also leaves much to be desired, I expected a more epic and painful conclusion, however, everything ends too easily. Everyone wanted to see the Reverend suffer more and pay for all the suffering he&apos;d caused poor Liz. But, in a way, she finds her redemption through her daughter.\n\nAn apotheotic and exaggerated closing, loaded with the inks of metaphor, anticipates the true conclusion of the work. A ramification of a past event ends up in the protagonist&apos;s future, after the long duel - physical and mental - against the Reverend. Unjust and desperate, resolutely sad but inexorable. At the same time, he signals hopeful as the lights illuminate Elli&apos;s father&apos;s hovel so many years into the future. The narration of the first seconds of Brimstone is the same as the last moments. We finally understand the unfathomable opening scene that takes place under the waters of a lake. And the civilizing cycle continues unscathed, indifferent to the vicissitudes of that environment. Violence does not prevent life from moving forward, and a supposed evil atavism finds no place in the descendants of those people. They can live without the weight of the past, marching unabated towards the future, keeping in memory only the examples of intense strength and perseverance of a warrior woman, who never bowed before a cruel fate that seemed manifest - she preferred freedom, and he fought for it tirelessly, bearing whatever costs were necessary on this journey of pain and suffering.",

DIE FÄLSCHER shows how high talented Jewish forgers have been forced by the SS to work with them. I have now a better view about the development of the German machinery. The movie is well directed with a fast pace and full of turns and twists that led to the Oscar as best foreign film of this year. I have never got bored and I liked it. \n\nThere have been several respectable productions in the last years about the holocaust as for example THE PIANIST, BLACK BOOK, DER UNTERGANG, DIE LETZTEN TAGE DER SOPHIE SCHOLL or DER LETZTE ZUG.

      "reviewBody": "The Good Son (1993) is a movie I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows a young man who recently lost his mother. His father needs to go on a business trip and thinks it would be good for the boy to stay with his aunt and uncle and their two kids near his age. The young boy of the aunt and uncle has some curiosities that ar first seem fun to both cousins but get morbid quick. This movie is directed by Joseph Ruben (Dreamscape) and stars Macaulay Culkin (Home Alone), Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings), David Morse (The Green Mile) and Wendy Crewson (Air Force One). The storyline for this is absolutely brilliant and perfectly delivered. The character development for both families is well established. The cast delivers awesome performances, especially Wood and Culkin. The script is very good and helps establish how menacing and ruthless Culkin is in the film. The action scenes are excellent and as ruthless as Culkin&apos;s dialogue. The is a film you get mesmerized by the characters and understand how the truth would be impossible to believe by the parents only making matters worse. The conclusion of this film is classic and sheer perfection. There&apos;s nothing I&apos;d change about this film. This is an underrated gem I&apos;d score a 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m in no hurry to get in the boxing ring with director Uwe Boll, a man who has been known to use his pugilistic skills to silence his less favourable critics, but I have got to say that this horror/action film (apparently based on an Atari video game) is utterly diabolical—far worse than I ever expected (my opinion of Boll had been reasonably high after seeing Rampage, which was surprisingly effective).\n\nThe long-winded opening narration is the first clue that this is going to stink: ancient civilisations, evil creatures from another world, a secret organisation devoted to investigation of the paranormal, and a mad scientist experimenting on orphaned children are clumsily thrown together in an attempt to establish the background to the film, but they only succeed in confusing the viewer before things have even begun. Matters are made even more incomprehensible with a prologue that occurs &apos;22 years ago&apos; but which segues into the present day and proceeds to introduce even more mind-bogglingly random elements to ensure that even the most astute of viewers will be completely baffled.\n\nAs the film progresses, more and more nonsensical garbage is haphazardly thrown into the mix, Boll&apos;s pointless directorial stylisms making everything impossible to follow, with the occasional voice-over by Christian Slater (intended to help explain matters) only adding to the embarrassment factor. Ridiculous voice-overs aside, Slater&apos;s performance isn&apos;t all that bad, but his co-star Tara Reid is absolutely terrible and was clearly hired for her looks (yet she doesn&apos;t even have the decency to take off her bra during the obligatory sex scene!).\n\nAfter much frenetic shooting, a smattering of reasonably fun gore, some choice snippets of lousy dialogue (&apos;Some doors are meant to stay shut&apos;) and lots of naff CGI creature attacks, during which Boll throws in some lousy Indiana Jones-style adventure and a scene completely ripped off from James Cameron&apos;s Aliens (the Xenos—yes the monsters ARE called that—obliterate a team of soldiers, despite the use of automated sentry guns), the film wraps up leaving the viewer none the wiser about what they have witnessed.",

To clarify...aren&apos;t all possession movies inherently pro-Christian since the inclusion of demons and hell implies that there is are angels and heaven (since Lucifer was cast out of heaven and became the devil)?\n\nAs someone that has seen lot of REALLY bad horror films, I can safely say that The Lazarus Effect isn&apos;t all that bad. It&apos;s got a pretty decent cast in Mark Duplass and Olivia Wilde, but it&apos;s a cheap horror film. You get the predictable jump-scares, you get the dialed in dialogue, what else did you expect?\n\nYou don&apos;t go to see horror films because they&apos;re particularly well written or original. This movie is literally just a hodgepodge of movies like: Carrie, Lucy (the whole 10% of your brain thing), The Phoenix Project, Pet Semetary, Flatliners, etc. \n\nI actually somewhat enjoyed this, but you realistically need to set your expectations 6 feet under. Maybe this film will find a way to resurrect some of your faith in the horror genre that way. It sure as hell isn&apos;t going to resurrect the $10 bucks you spent on the ticket at the theater. \n\nAdditionally, what ever happened to the novelty of watching a film before reviewing it? \n\nRead the full review and others like it on the Drive-in Zeppelin website",

It&apos;s great to see new and inventive stories and plot points. You never really quite know what to think or where it will end up, and that was the best part of the writing, directing and editing... Nurse Wright arrives in small town Ireland hired to &apos;watch&apos; an 11 year old girl for medical reasons... Together with a nun, they take 8 hour shifts, but as it is the year 1860, science and religious beliefs are quite seperate, but also closely linked.\n\nThe acting and slow development of the story keep you engaged and your brain ticking over the possible act III outcomes and payoffs... If you enjoy the period piece, drama, thriller type event then go into this one not knowing too much, if that&apos;s possible.\n\nCould end up on the best of the year lists for some I think...

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Somewhere&quot; is a polarizing film, which makes it all the stranger that I find myself precisely in the middle of debate. Some hail it as a minimalistic masterwork, while others leave the theater rubbing sleep from their eyes. The latest film by Sofia Coppola isn&apos;t for everyone, and stands so structureless that it threatens to liquefy at any moment. With few cuts and most scenes playing out in even fewer angles, it&apos;s easy to grow impatient or frustrated with the director. What I admire about her film however is its commitment to capturing complete moments even at the expense of the audience.\n\n&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; this isn&apos;t. &quot;Somewhere&quot; isn&apos;t anchored by as charismatic or immediately recognizable an on screen pair as Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. The world of the former film is also more vibrant and alive than the Hollywood Coppola depicts. She dials back everything until &quot;Somewhere&quot; is essentially an exercise in simplicity. Many have found that quality refreshing, but I was left somewhat cold by the purely surface-level examination of the tedium of stardom.\n\nI absolutely admire Coppola&apos;s intentions. Probably my biggest gripe with &quot;Somewhere&quot; is that it employs plot-bombs out of necessity. After 45 minutes of casual observation of our protagonist, burnt-out actor Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff), Coppola inelegantly drops 30 seconds of expository dialogue into a phone call that sets up the rest of movie. It rings immediately false and seems out of place in an otherwise drifting film.\n\nAnd there are some beautiful sights along the way. Coppola manages to transcend her sedentary camera-work with occasionally brilliant choreography. A pair of pole dancers performing a hokey routine springs to mind, as does a gracefully executed figure skating sequence. The director has a knack for using characters rather than set-ups to color our experience, but my problem with &quot;Somewhere&quot; is that not every scene is equally fascinating. Some merely communicate an idea and a feeling, but drag on for far too long. Admittedly, to truncate her moments would be to rob them of their intended impact, but as a moviegoer it&apos;s hardly thrilling to watch characters lounge poolside for the better part of a minute.\n\nCoppola is at her most successful when she&apos;s able to wring the irony out of a scenario. When Johnny arrives in Italy to accept an award, we get a clear sense of the dichotomy between the hoopla of the entertainment industry and a jaded entertainer. That everyone around him is speaking in a foreign language completes the metaphor and makes for one of film&apos;s best sequences. Watching the character play &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; is comparably flat. That scene serves only one purpose: to demystify celebrity. While I wouldn&apos;t go so far as to call it boring, it doesn&apos;t offer any additional insight into the character.\n\nBut then &quot;Somewhere&quot; isn&apos;t just a portrait of a movie star but a portrait of a father, and Dorff and Elle Fanning deserve recognition for the flawlessly naturalistic relationship their characters share. Considered opposite her countless melodramatic peers, Coppola is in a league of her own. The people who populate her films never fail to impress with their nuance, but in this case I&apos;m not convinced the filmmaking does them justice.\n\n&quot;Somewhere&quot; is a film I find equally hard to love or hate, though I sympathize better with its detractors. Nevertheless, it posits compelling characters, great performances, and enough smart and amusing scenes to make worth recommending. Whether you leave the theater rubbing sleep from your eyes or having witnessed a minimalistic masterpiece, you have my blessing. Much like Marco himself, I&apos;m neither here nor there.",

      "reviewBody": "Brimming with an unmistakable 1980s flavour, jam-packed with truly impressive special effects, and also amongst the better examples of its genre(s), The Blob may feature a simple premise &amp; serviceable set of characters but it still manages to make the most of its available resources by making sure that its foundation is strong, the basic fundamentals are covered and the technical execution is sound.\n\nCo-written &amp; directed by Chuck Russell, the story follows a deadly entity from space that crash-lands in a small town and starts growing by dissolving &amp; devouring anything n everything that&apos;s in its path. The character introductions are bland and the setup is meh too but once the horrific creature surfaces, everything get dialled up and unfolds with relentless intensity to deliver truly terrifying moments of horror.\n\nThe plot navigates rebellious youth, government conspiracy, biological warfare &amp; secret cover-up in ways that forward the narrative but the main highlight is the spectacular make-up effects &amp; stellar craftsmanship that goes into bringing the strange, gelatinous life form to life. The gory kills &amp; mayhem it has in store have that grindhouse quality to it and although the performances aren&apos;t strong enough, they do meet the brief.\n\nOverall, The Blob is another quality addition to the list of sci-fi horror remakes that are superior to their original entries and remains a gripping, thrilling &amp; amusing offering after all these years. Having effectively stood against the test of time and still retaining its ability to shock &amp; surprise, this nightmarish yet entertaining fare is very much reflective of the cynical era it belongs to and delivers the desired violence in gleeful doses. Highly recommended."

A lot of the humor is predictable and (most annoyingly) often repeated. For example, Winslow (Larvell Jones), was doing his silly &quot;karate man&quot; humor excessively though many of the &quot;Police Academy&quot; films. If he only did this in one film, the humorous impact would have been cherished more. The first three &quot;Police Academy&quot; films are the best. Taking this predictable slapstick into four more follow-up films (with totally forgettable stories, was just a bit too much.) On a positive note, &quot;Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol&quot; starred Corinne Bohrer as Laura. What a gorgeous blonde babe she is! And also, I&apos;ll have to admit that on the documentaries of the making of the &quot;Police Academy&quot; films, Leslie Easterbrook is still quite an attractive looking woman. Marian Ramsey still looks good, too."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Dracula: Dead and Loving It&quot; is a movie that seems to define what someone either really likes or dislikes about a comedy, and more specifically a parody: gags.  For me, the gags herein worked, there were reasons for their having been used and therefore makes it funny to me.  The storyline didn&apos;t stall, the gags weren&apos;t desperate for laughs, and the acting was exactly what was needed: the comedic touch.  \n\nThe casting choice to have Steven Weber and Amy Yasbeck, both veterans of the TV series &quot;Wings&quot;, was brilliant because the chemistry between their personalities was proven and honed before the movie.  The choice of Leslie Nielsen for the titular role was dead-on.  Someone that has the wisdom of centuries (decades, whatever), is cunning (a la the Naked Gun series), and above all, never gives up (until turned to dust).  Mel Brooks, having proved his comedic prowess with films like &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;, comes through in the role of Van Helsing.  Even the incidental characters seem to have a reason to belong and flow in the movie, like Essie, the guardian of Mina, or Martin, Dr. Seward&apos;s right-hand man of the sanitarium...\n\nMartin:  &quot;...the patient in the west wing?  He&apos;s havin&apos; a conniption fit.&quot;\n\nDr. Seward:  &quot;Oh.  Give him an enima.&quot;\n\nAs stated, the movie will most likely be quite funny or very dull, depending on what the viewer expects from it beforehand.  Being that I like a good slapstick comedy (and I do), the performances above all are what were able to pull me in.\n\nFOOSH-TAA!\n\n&quot;Dracula: Dead and Loving It&quot; gets 9 of 10 stars",

The heroes are flawed and complicated, the villains, for the most part, have motivation and even sympathy. I found myself rooting for the murderous, vampiric prostitute as much for the innocent girl trapped into releasing those tired of life.\n\nIt&apos;s really two films, one set 200 hundred years ago, one in the present time, with many of the same characters and the same location, Hastings, once a fishing village, now a tired seaside resort.\n\nThe actors are very good, particularly the leads. As a resident of SE England, I recognised many of the locations. The ending was perhaps a little predictable, but still satisfying.\n\nDon&apos;t go see this if you like your vampires to sparkle, but if you liked Let The Right One In and gritty drama, go watch it.",

      "name": "an intriguing sensitive suspense drama that is not meant for all",
      "reviewBody": "When was the last time Indian audience have witness an intriguing noiri-sh suspense drama without any cheap thrills? Probably not in recent times (for starters Kahaani is a suspense thriller). Talaash is one such celluloid experience that will captivate you to the last reel. The film is a dark,complex psychological yet there are layers of emotions which makes it more compelling..Add to this there is an Occult angle to the mystery..\n\nThe film starts with a darkish depiction of Maximum city with eerie background music followed by a car coming at high speed which suddenly takes a turn and gets drowned in a river. It is later known that famous cine-star Arman Kapoor died in that car accident (or murder or something??) Inspector Shekhawat gets the charge of the case. At a personal front Mr shekhawat and his wife are trying to come to terms with untimely loss of their son. The two incidences get connected at a point which changes the life of the protagonist. Without revealing the story I can say clearly the detailing is commendable and you can see the dots getting connected.\n\nReema Kagti in her second directorial venture proved her understanding of this medium and fluidness in handling of complex themes. Talaash is one of the most complex films of recent times with layers to the narrative and characters. At the same time it&apos;s a thriller and an emotional drama of a father coming to terms with his child&apos;s loss. The emotions and vulnerability of Inspector Shekhawat is genuinely expressed which one can identify with. Everyone of us have lost a near or dear one at some point of time we will (recently I lost my mother) and after that the mere existence becomes difficult. At those moments mind and brains starts behaving weirdly and one starts accepting irrationality which gives one inner peace. Talaash explores one of those phases of life when everything seems at lost yet one has to move on with life. Without giving away any suspense I would say Kagti&apos;s (&amp; Zoya akhtar) script webbed in a beguiling suspense drama around that complex phenomenon. Kudos to K.U Mohanan&apos;s camera-work (who was recently being part of award winning pulp noir Miss Lovely) brilliantly captured the by-lanes of Mumbai. Mumbai becomes a darker character in this mystery. The fear of danger lurking around the corner can be sensed and it seems no one should be believed. Subaya&apos;s editing and Ram Sampat&apos;s flawless music add on to the proceeding and help in building the circuitous narrative. Sampat&apos;s music is brilliant with Akhtar&apos;s lyrics especially &quot;Lakh duniya kahe tum nehi ho&quot; is mark of a genius and someone who have lost a dear one will surely relate to the lyrics. It brings tear to one&apos;s eyes as one look back at life. &quot;Jiya lagena&quot; songs has a good video which gels with the fusion music. There are moments which had excellence written all over it like one in which Shekhawat is trying to recall his child&apos;s accident and ponders how his way of handling the situation in a different fashion would have saved him from drowning. The eerie background score and blurred camera work in few of the sequences justifies the end when the truth comes out.\n\nThe end is heartening which leaves a lump in your throat, yet the urge to watch it again remains. May be in the second viewing one will find another aspect of the story.\n\nAamir Khan again proved that he is the only superstar who wants to associate with quality cinema. This film doesn&apos;t have the regular masala appeal wala entertainment. While all other stars are playing it safe Aamir ensures that his film has some meat which will be remembered down the line. His performance as Inspector Shekhawat deserves awards and accolades. He flawlessly portrays amenability of a depressed soul who has been caught in a web of mystery. His sequences with Rosy showed his versatility as an actor. Kareena Kapoor is effective as escort Rosy. The role is sensitive and something not on the lines of a typical mainstream heroine but Kareena effortlessly fits in it. Rani Mukherjee is just about perfect as Shekhawat&apos;s lonely wife. Another actor who steals the show is Nawazuddind Siddiqui as Taimur who has proved his mettle this year with GOW &amp; Kahaani and now this one (Those few privileged soul who got the chance to see Miss Lovely would have already labeled Siddiqui as finest actor of recent times). He is one of the central characters of this mystery and delivered his best. One will remember this character long after the movie is over. Shernaz Patel &amp; Raj Kumar yadav are ever reliable actors and suits the bill. Subrata Sen as Shahsi leaves his mark in a small role. All the other actors did a decent job.\n\nOn a whole Talaash is a rare suspense drama which would be loved by connoisseurs of good cinema. This film will open new window to this genre and hopefully more complicated psychological themes will be explored in the near future. One thing is for sure Talaash will be remembered in the long run as a fine cinematic experience that remained true to the style and content till the very end without falling into traps of commercial arena.\n\nComing to the end of the film there has been criticism from some sectors claiming it to be &quot;unrealistic&quot; but then who told them the film depicts hardcore reality. The film just tells a story of coming to terms with loss and that also a gripping one with usage of &quot;after life&quot; concept to build the narrative. The end is sensitive.With untimely loss of your near and dear one you would feel or crave for some answers as to why &quot;You&quot; and the answer lies within...And in this film Mr &amp; Mrs Shekhawat at least got some explanations in their quest(Talaash).."

(er, by that I mean it HAS...)\n\nI was a bit like the Sean Astin character when I was at school. If only I&apos;d had a caveman of my own to help me pull chicks, how differently things might have turned out...\n\nOkay, so the movie has no basis in reality, but who would expect it to? Cavemen aside, it&apos;s a TEEN movie, and they NEVER depict real people or situations. At least, not on any planet I&apos;ve ever been to. \n\nThis movie doesn&apos;t pretend to be anything outstanding. It&apos;s intended purely as entertainment, and that&apos;s what it is.\n\nIt appears to have been promoted as one of those frightful &quot;Pauly Shore movies&quot;, but it&apos;s not. He&apos;s really just a supporting player (and is nowhere near as annoying in small doses, it turns out). This is Brendan Fraser&apos;s flick. If anyone else had played Link, I can&apos;t imagine the movie being as good as it is.\n\nMy one beef is that Sandra Hess (&quot;Cave Nug&quot;) wasn&apos;t given enough screen time (but then, as far as I&apos;m concerned, she&apos;s NEVER given enough screen time).\n\nI never knew Scatterbrain had covered &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot;, either. That&apos;s cool.\n\nOkay, I&apos;m going for a lie down now.\n\nBye.",

      "reviewBody": "I decided to rewatch &quot;V/H/S/2&quot; to introduce this series to my brother. The film takes a dark approach, almost resembling a snuff movie, but always rewards us with creative twists that pay homage to various elements of horror cinema.\n\nThe film presents four short films directed by notable names in the genre, such as Simon Barrett, Adam Wingard, Eduardo Sánchez, and Gregg Hale (the creators of &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot;), Gareth Evans, and Timo Tjahjanto.\n\nThe movie begins with &quot;Phase I Clinical Trials,&quot; which might be the weakest of the anthology. The premise involves a man who, after receiving an ocular implant, starts seeing spirits. However, the execution falls short. The concept is intriguing, but the short is hampered by a lack of tension, as well as makeup and cinematography that fail to create the necessary atmosphere for effective horror.\n\nMoving on to &quot;A Ride in the Park,&quot; we see a more creative and fresh take on the zombie subgenre. The idea of seeing the world through the eyes of a zombie is an interesting twist, especially in the context of found footage. This short stands out for its originality, offering a new perspective by showing things from the villain&apos;s point of view. Unlike the generic &quot;In A Violent Nature,&quot; which used the same formula, this entry brought something new, keeping the viewer engaged and intrigued. It&apos;s an example of how a simple idea can be turned into something good when done right.\n\n&quot;Safe Haven&quot; is, without a doubt, the highlight of &quot;V/H/S/2.&quot; This short film, focused on a bizarre and terrifying cult, perfectly captures the essence of psychological and supernatural horror. The tension is palpable, and the narrative takes the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster, culminating in a shocking ending. The cinematography, atmosphere, and performances are exceptional, creating a very bizarre mood. This segment deserves to be expanded into a full-length feature.\n\nThe final short, &quot;Slumber Party Alien Abduction,&quot; closes the anthology with an interesting take on alien invasion. While not the most impactful, it still manages to entertain and surprise. I recommend watching it with the volume up to enhance the sensory experience.\n\nIn summary, &quot;V/H/S/2&quot; is an anthology that, even though it doesn&apos;t fully capture the surprise of my first viewing, still offers moments of pure horror and creativity. It&apos;s an experience that, despite its imperfections, is worth revisiting-especially for those looking for something different in the horror genre.",

A smoldering boy moves in next door, he goes to the same school as J Lo&apos;s son where she&apos;s a teacher; a night of sex upsets balances. \n\nThe appeal is that we can have an assault on suburban normalcy, a titilating dismantling of normalcy; for example he fills a classroom with photocopies of their coupling and she has to scoop it up while pupils are about to come in any moment. Brakes on a car have been tampered with, he has kept a video, shenanigans just pile on and we watch in sardonic amusement as it gets more unhinged; it ends in one swoop with people getting shot and crushed by a winch. \n\nOn J Lo&apos;s end of things it&apos;s an opportunity for someone here to claim that the film empowers women and for us to arrive at the moral of the story, that mistakes happen and people deserve a second chance. I&apos;ll take the refreshing erotic thriller nonsense of this kind over juvenile Marvel races to save the world."

      "reviewBody": "After making decidedly wrong turns into rom-com in 2007&apos;s &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; and historical biopic in 2009&apos;s &quot;Amelia&quot;, Hilary Swank is back in her element as Betty Ann Waters, a working-class single mother of two whose fierce loyalty to her troublemaking brother Kenny knows no bounds, in actor/director Tony Goldwyn&apos;s time-spanning, fact-based 2010 drama. Written by Pamela Gray (she and Goldwyn also collaborated on 1999&apos;s affecting &quot;A Walk on the Moon&quot;), the inspiring, potentially melodramatic plot line often borders on incredulity, but Swank&apos;s trademark iron-jawed tenacity is on full display here. At the same time, it&apos;s a primarily economic performance teetering on lunacy as her character is tightly bound to Kenny since they shared a painful childhood due to the neglect of a horrifying mother.\n\nIn 1983, Kenny is convicted of the bloody murder of an elderly neighbor largely on the basis of testimony from two former girlfriends, both of whom claimed he confessed his actions to them. Neither Kenny nor Betty Anne can afford a good attorney, so she decides to become a lawyer even though she&apos;s a high school dropout. Also serving as one of the film&apos;s executive producers, Swank come back securely to the against-all-odds territory of Clint Eastwood&apos;s &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; (2004) by following Betty Ann&apos;s sixteen-year journey from her GED through college, then law school, and finally passing the bar – all while she was raising two boys and working part-time at a local pub. The ending is predictable from a mile away, but the journey is not. The introduction of DNA evidence provides a linchpin that spins the story close to Lifetime-level dramatics, especially when Betty Ann solicits the assistance of the Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization devoted to overturning wrongful convictions. Gray&apos;s screenplay is solid enough, and Goldwyn&apos;s direction is assured within the back-and-forth treatment of the timeline.\n\nHowever, it&apos;s really the acting that is aces here. Beyond Swank&apos;s sterling work, Sam Rockwell brings an unpredictable furor and a surprising vulnerability to the showier role of Kenny. His rapport with Swank never feels forced, and the devotion of their sibling relationship is what really grounds the threat of hysterics in the film. The periphery is populated by a powerful squad of actresses turning in sharply etched work - Minnie Driver as Betty Ann&apos;s law-school friend Abra, whose comic spark highlights how pivotal her character is in representing the audience viewpoint; Melissa Leo (&quot;Frozen River&quot;) as the malevolent arresting cop, whose secretive hostility provides the impetus for Kenny&apos;s conviction; Juliette Lewis as Kenny&apos;s dentally-challenged ex-girlfriend with a drunken confession scene that reveals the actress&apos;s long-forgotten raw talent below her usual giddiness; Karen Young in a brief scene as the unforgivable Mrs. Waters; and Ari Graynor (&quot;Nick and Norah&apos;s Infinite Playlist&quot;) as Kenny&apos;s embittered grown daughter. It&apos;s the cast&apos;s cumulative work that makes this movie intensely watchable.",

      "reviewBody": "I went to this only because I couldn&apos;t get into the movie I came to the theater for. I don&apos;t know Dane Cook&apos;s stand-up and hated him in the overrated Dan In Real Life. But, we figured we could pass time for two hours so we went in.\n\nIt started routinely enough. Okay, the guy gets paid to be the date from heck so the girls goes crying back into her guy&apos;s arms. Okay concept, if executed well. Then we get Jason Biggs trying to clean up his act to impress Kate Hudson who likes him but is not wowed by him. Since Jason is Dane&apos;s roommate, he hires Dane to do his specialty. By this point, we&apos;re 20+ minutes into the movie and it made me laugh twice and is otherwise pretty lame. I looked at my watch. Then, Kate&apos;s roommate preps her for the date to sow some wild oats and the real fun begins.\n\nThe humor in My Best Friend&apos;s Girl is rude, crude, inappropriate, socially irredeemable -- and made me laugh out loud - a lot! Cook&apos;s chemistry with Hudson was electric. The twist is she can give as good as she gets and vice versa. She gets under his skin, but he stays in denial, leading to his next assignment which to me was the high point of the movie. The girl is religious and he takes her to a restaurant in an old church called Jesus Crust - where pizza is a religious experience. i don&apos;t want to spoil the inspired gags in this sequence, but I was nearly rolling in the aisles. This victim actually winds up setting the stage for a few plot twists I didn&apos;t expect. The movie is raucous fun from then on until the end.\n\nI thought Alec Baldwin was absurdly funny as the Women&apos;s Studies professor who is Cook&apos;s father. His chemistry with Cook is also terrific. Cook&apos;s former client who is about to marry Kate&apos;s sister is also hilarious as is she and the woman playing Kate&apos;s mother. Then, the movie goes a bit soft,conventional, and derivative -- but is still witty at the end, and the last two scenes play out nicely.\n\nThis is not a piece of art, but if you ever went to frat parties and can remember having fun at them and want to spend some time laughing out loud, give My Best Friend&apos;s Girl a look. I work in Manhattan so I have to be careful to whom I say I liked this movie -- that&apos;s why I call it a guilty pleasure!",

Her father, the racist banker Percy Jones (Bernie Mac), does not accept the white Simon and does not give a break to Simon. In the end, love is beautiful, and all the family problems are fixed.\n\nAlthough having the theme &quot;visiting the family&quot;, which is very explored in comedies by Hollywood, the beginning of &quot;Guess Who&quot; is funny, with many hilarious racist situations. I laughed a lot, for example, with the confusion of Percy with the cab driver in the arrival of Simon to his house; or with the stupid dialogs of Simon with Percy, making the situations worse and worse. There are some jokes at the grandfather&apos;s dinner table that I did not understand (for example, the joke with the &quot;ho&quot; sister). Bernie Mac is simply perfect in the role of a very racist black man, and Aston Kutcher is very good in the role of an impulsive young guy that does not think before speaking. Indeed his character is too much silly to be a good and disputed professional in business. Unfortunately, in a certain moment the story become boring and corny, certainly for commercial interests in order to have a politically correct conclusion. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Família da Noiva&quot; (&quot;The Family of the Bride&quot;)",

Considering that 85 percent of the films that come out are absurd and complete garbage, this one was decent. It&apos;s one of those movies where after you see it you&apos;ll think &quot;that was OK/pretty good...but I&apos;m glad ;I didn&apos;t pay $10 to see it in the theater&quot;. After you view it, you will feel satisfied and there should not be a desire to watch it over &amp; over again - say, like There Will Be Blood. I cant recall any situations in the film that you could consider ridiculous or unbelievable. The movie was filmed on location in Portland, Oregon. So when they are in the setting they say they&apos;re in, they&apos;re really there. The movie kept me wondering until the end what was going to happen and it didn&apos;t end the way I thought it would. I don&apos;t want to give anything away as to not ruin your viewing experience. Amanda Seyfried gave a great performance putting in exactly what was required. No extra, unnecessary funny stuff.\n\nI hope this review sets the proper expectation for your viewing experience.

      "name": "The Beautiful Game",
      "reviewBody": "Brian Clough (1935-2004) has some claim to be regarded as the greatest ever club manager in English football. Others, such as Bob Paisley and Sir Alex Ferguson, may have won more in terms of trophies, but they did so after taking over clubs which were already wealthy, successful and established. Clough&apos;s unique achievement was to take over a struggling, unsuccessful Second Division club, Derby County, turn them into English champions, and then to repeat this feat with a second struggling, unsuccessful Second Division club, Nottingham Forest, who went on to become not only English champions but also European champions.\n\nClough&apos;s career in football management, however, was not an uninterrupted success story, and &quot;The Damned United&quot; tells the story of his greatest failure, his 44-day tenure as manager of Leeds United in 1974. Over the past decade, under the management of Don Revie, Leeds had become one of the leading clubs in England, and in 1974 were reigning League champions. They were, however, also the most hated club in England, having become notorious not only for a cautious, defensive attitude to the game but also for gamesmanship and violent play.\n\nAlthough Clough and Revie loathed one another, they had much in common. Both came from the same town, Middlesbrough, growing up only a few streets apart. Both had enjoyed successful playing careers, playing at centre-forward, both had been capped for England, and both had played for the same club, Sunderland. Revie had also taken over Leeds United as a struggling Second Division club and had turned them into champions. Yet they had very different attitudes to the game. In contrast to Revie&apos;s &quot;win-at-all-costs&quot; attitude, Clough was an idealist with a firm belief in fair play and open, attacking football; he frequently referred to &quot;the beautiful game&quot;, long before this phrase had become the cliché it is today. When Revie was appointed as England manager, Clough therefore seemed a strange choice to replace him as Leeds manager, especially as he had been one fiercest critics both of the club and of Revie. (Many other managers, in fact, agreed with Clough&apos;s opinions in private, but few had dared to express them quite so publicly).\n\nClough&apos;s main weakness as a manager appears to have been his lack of tact and diplomacy. He was fond of speaking his mind, and despite winning the Championship with Derby had been ousted as manager of that club following clashes with the club chairman Sam Longson. According to this film, Clough&apos;s first act as Leeds manager was to tell his players to throw away all their medals and trophies, &quot;because they won them by cheating&quot;. Given this attitude, it is hardly surprising that Clough was disliked by the Leeds players, most of whom had idolised Revie. They were determined not to take Clough&apos;s message of &quot;good, clean attractive football&quot; to heart; during his first match in charge of Leeds, the Charity Shield against Liverpool, the club captain, Billy Bremner, was red-carded for brawling on the pitch with an opponent. (He received an 11-game suspension and never played again under Clough&apos;s management). Discontent among the players was a major factor in persuading the club&apos;s directors to dismiss Clough after a run of poor results.\n\nThe film is not a comprehensive biopic of Clough; it concentrates on his brief spell at Leeds, with the story of his days at Derby being told in flashback. It does not deal with his early life or playing career at all, only briefly touches on his private life outside the game, and his successes with Nottingham Forest are only mentioned in passing in an epilogue at the end. It presents a fictionalised version of his life and occasionally takes liberties with the facts. (Contrary to the impression given here, Dave Mackay, a one-time Derby player who succeeded Clough as manager, was not on the club&apos;s playing staff at the time of his appointment).\n\nThe film&apos;s main virtues are an excellent script from Peter Morgan and some equally excellent acting. Michael Sheen seems to specialise in playing real people, and although he bears a certain physical resemblance to Clough he avoids the mistake he made when playing Tony Blair in &quot;The Queen&quot;, that of trying to imitate his subject too exactly as though he were a Mike Yarwood-style impressionist rather than a dramatic actor. The other excellent contributions come from Colm Meaney as the self-righteous Revie, genuinely unable to understand why anyone might object to his team&apos;s playing style, from Jim Broadbent as Longson, a self-important small-town businessman who has attached himself to the town&apos;s football club despite an almost total ignorance of the game, and from Timothy Spall as Clough&apos;s assistant, Peter Taylor. Unlike Sheen and Meaney, Spall bears very little resemblance to the man he is playing, but as Taylor generally kept a much lower profile than Clough this does not really matter. Taylor, a more substantial figure than most assistant club managers, nevertheless played a key role at Derby, so he is an important character in this drama. He did not follow Clough to Leeds; had he done so, Clough&apos;s appointment might have been a greater success.\n\nDespite its international popularity, football has inspired surprisingly few good films, and virtually no great ones. In the 2000s, however, the British cinema managed to produce two very good films about the sport, of which this is the second. (The first was &quot;Bend It like Beckham&quot;). The film&apos;s main appeal will, I suspect, be to sports fans and to those with an interest in football history, especially those who, like myself, are old enough to remember the events of the 1970s. Nevertheless, there is enough human drama in &quot;The Damned United&quot; to appeal to film-lovers who have only a passing interest in football. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "If you liked Pi or The Cruise then you should check out Naked. It&apos;s an amazing exploration of a man descended into nihilism, who leaves victims of his intellectual bullying (and misogyny) everywhere. No, it&apos;s not PC. Yes, it feels so real. Sorry to gush, but I loved this film.\n\nI like American Existential Anti-Heroes. I wasn&apos;t really prepared to confront an English Existential Anti-Hero. Wow, what a different take on a similar stimulus.\n\nThis film is a monument to gritty realism, without being self-conscious about it. You can taste this movie. But you never feel like it was faked or forced. The camera work and the lighting never get in the way. I usually notice such things, and here it was invisible and completely immersive. David Thewlis throws every bit of his body into this movie. Even the great closing credit scene.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn&apos;t point out the fantastic black humor, especially since some people said it wasn&apos;t funny! Sophie wails in the most sustained way I have ever seen in drama. And it&apos;s hysterical, even as you&apos;re hurting with her. The frantic Scottish kid made me rewind again and again. While I agree that the &quot;landlord&quot; character could have been over the top, his reaction to Johnny flailing on the floor made me laugh out loud. The two characters are really barely distinguishable but that one is a dandy and the other has a fondness for the gutter. As the poster-hanger beats the crap out of our anti-hero you can&apos;t help but laugh. And then you nod along as Louise tells him he had it coming in her terrific and constant deadpan (with an occasional suggestion of a smile).\n\nAs our protagonist points out, in the end, all the books, and all the learning, and all the discussion, still don&apos;t help you understand the point of the cruel joke of life. Yes, it&apos;s an old dorm-room discussion that freshman are still having for the 1st time. But that doesn&apos;t make the question and the questioning any less desperate. It is human to cry out in pain, even when it&apos;s self-inflicted. The references to making a choice for self-destruction are throughout the dialogue, but not so much so that they hit you in the head.\n\nNaked is depressing and euphoric at the same time. Yes it&apos;s often &quot;awful&quot;, but how can you not cheer for someone who loves life and is trying his hardest to fully engage it? And not one character (or question) gets a pat Hollywood ending or moral -- woo-hoo!\n\nThis movie is why people can call film a legitimate art form. It provokes thought, it is drama, and it is beautiful. It thrills me.\n\nSomeone asked if the dialogue was improvised. According to IFC, Mike Leigh rehearsed with the cast for 11 weeks before writing the script, which then came to only 25 pages."

      "reviewBody": "A wolfhound brings out what Ang Lee so called &quot;amuck atmosphere.&quot; This might not necessarily be Eileen Chang&apos;s intention, but Lee achieved his practical &quot;masterpiece&quot; through expressing his feel for this short story.\n\nJust right before the task seems about going to end, Wang Jiazhi memorized, from an innocent college girl to a highly skilled actress and patriot, this extremely dangerous ambition kept circling around her mind and couldn&apos;t possibly go away may because of her ideal of doing something big and important, may because of proving that she&apos;s not only a puppet, or may because of a man that she can&apos;t get him out of her head.\n\nA terrific ensemble cast. Tang Wei, who played the soul of the film, transformed herself into the leading character successfully through an unfamiliar face to audiences and has the acting of unattached perfection just like Zhang Ziyi. Though she got set up to get involved with this role by Lee, the result shows that her efforts worth every second.\n\nThe best performance of Tony Leung by far, every look and movement is very precise. Though it&apos;s also postmodern and the same kind of costumes, the effect is totally different from the images in Wong Kar Wai movies. Even he has been through several villain characters, the devotion and outcome that he put in this role is never been seen before.\n\nAs for the controversial sex scenes that gather all the spotlights, they all take important places in the film just as Lee said. Even there&apos;s no sign of sex in Chang&apos;s story. Except the power demonstration of the leading male role, Mr. Yee, Wang learned to use her sex power, the abreaction from the huge frustration of both their occupations and the struggle and joy they soaked in the functioning sex. They could very likely be the perfect match for each other that they can never find another one in this lifetime.\n\nThe second-time Mexican cinematographer for Lee, Rodrigo Prieto, French musician Alexandre Desplat, the senior Korean designer Lai Pan, and Lee&apos;s longtime partner editor Tim Squyres. The global combination achieved the great technical support besides the compelling story and the feast of performances.\n\nThe funny part is Lee chose short stories back to back for his film. The time line of the previous one goes across over 20 years. As for the latter one is just an afternoon. Sure it seems like a story in a decade, but after all they are the flashbacks of the leading female role.\n\nThis movie definitely goes beyond the achievement of &quot;Brokeback Mountain,&quot; which is already very brilliant. While showing the conflict of sense and sensibility, it also pays tribute to a bunch of classics and the master creators which reflect the mind of the roles and are inherited such as &quot;Casablanca,&quot; &quot;The Godfather,&quot; &quot;Suspicion,&quot; &quot;Penny Serenade,&quot; &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; and &quot;In the Realm of the Senses.&quot; This is not only the best screen adaptation of Chang to date but also a must-see of all time.",

      "reviewBody": "When real-life couples star together, the resulting film can take on a fascinating meta-layer. Although their offscreen bond doesn&apos;t necessarily blur into their characters, it inevitably hovers in the background. Mike Nichols&apos; &apos;Who&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&apos; wasn&apos;t simply a searing portrait of marital warfare; it was also Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, cinema&apos;s most famous spouses, sparring with a ferocity that audiences couldn&apos;t help but connect to their tempestuous private lives.\n\nLikewise, Stanley Kubrick&apos;s &apos;Eyes Wide Shut&apos; wasn&apos;t just a puzzle about desire and fidelity. Echoed against the backdrop of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman&apos;s highly publicized marriage, the couple&apos;s casting lent an extra layer of voyeuristic intrigue to the film. That extra-textual dimension doesn&apos;t alter the story, but it makes the fiction feel charged in ways it otherwise wouldn&apos;t.\n\nThis is also the case with Michael Shanks&apos; &apos;Together,&apos; starring the real-life couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie. A body-horror à la Coralie Fargeat&apos;s &apos;The Substance,&apos; the film follows long-time partners Tim and Millie, who have been drifting apart. After relocating to the countryside, they encounter a mysterious force that starts to reshape their lives, forcing them closer than ever. Soon, their romance becomes a macabre affair, as the boundaries between co-dependence and monstrosity irrevocably blur.\n\nAtmospheric, visceral and laced with dark humour, Shanks&apos; film grips from start to finish. Essentially a Cronenbergian romantic comedy, it&apos;s bloody good fun, with some thematic weight. Shanks&apos; narrative cleverly uses the language of body-horror to externalize the often-unspoken dynamics undermining relationships. More than an external threat, the disgusting entity that binds Tim and Millie embodies their neediness for, and resentment towards, one another.\n\nHorror has always excelled at making the abstract tangible- whether it be desire as parasite, or intimacy as contagion- and Shanks leans into that tradition with gory relish. In &apos;Together&apos;, the spectacle of skin and sinew isn&apos;t there for shock alone, but as a metaphor for how love can devour, how co-dependence can trap partners in a suffocating cycle of intimacy. As proceedings intensify, the couple&apos;s bond is forced into a crucible, revealing both the strength and fragility of their connection.\n\nShanks&apos; strong characterisation emphasises this point, especially when it comes to Tim. He is far from a traditional macho protagonist, being a vulnerable, tentative man marked by trauma. He can&apos;t work a compass or start a fire, and relies heavily on Millie in everyday situations. His hesitancy and fragility ground the film, making the couple&apos;s descent into grotesquerie more affecting than it otherwise might be.\n\nMillie, too, is drawn with nuance; a smart young teacher who loves Tim and wants the best for him, but whose patience sometimes frays under the weight of his insecurities. Together, they feel less like genre archetypes and more a realistic couple. Their exchanges throughout are natural, laced with a dry wit that feels true to life. At its core, the film is a love story, which works because one believes in Tim and Millie&apos;s bond- the tenderness beneath the terror.\n\nVisually, the film is as striking as it is unsettling. Germain McMicking&apos;s cinematography cloaks the rural setting in a pall of damp greys and muted greens, evoking both isolation and decay. Further, Nicholas Dare&apos;s production design makes the world feel intimate yet suffocating, deeply alive- disquietingly breathing.\n\nIn addition, the effects work is impressively tactile, leaning on practical gore and prosthetics rather than CGI, giving things a raw, clammy immediacy. Shanks doesn&apos;t flinch from grotesque detail, yet the imagery never tips into gratuity. Just as crucial are the sound design and score: the former wringing dread from creaks, squelches and silences, the latter pulsing uneasily beneath the action without overwhelming it. Further, Sean Lahiff&apos;s editing is sharp and economical, ensuring every shock lands with precision.\n\nAs Tim and Millie, Dave Franco and Alison Brie&apos;s real-life marriage lends their on-screen intimacy a raw authenticity, making Shanks&apos; vision of closeness-turning-hideous even more disturbing. Both deliver powerhouse performances- Franco in particular, showing a vulnerability and range rarely glimpsed in his comedic work. Brie, meanwhile, plays Millie with a sharp mix of exasperation and tenderness, anchoring the film&apos;s emotional core. Damon Herriman also does fine work in a supporting role as Millie&apos;s work colleague Jamie, whose personable demeanour belies a hidden darkness.\n\nIn conclusion, Michael Shanks&apos; &apos;Together&apos; is bloody great: a grisly reflection of intimacy, co-dependence and the messy realities of love. Dave Franco and Alison Brie work wonderfully together, grounding Shanks&apos; Cronenbergian vision in something startlingly human. With tactile effects, evocative cinematography and a keen ear for dread, the film shows how passion can curdle into possession, with devastating consequences. In short, in the realm of body-horror, &apos;Together&apos; stands apart.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always been fascinated by the original Stanford prison experiment. It always had the ingredients for a fascinating study of human behaviour. Its conductor Dr. Philip Zimbardo knew that, it just had to be played out. Of course, The Stanford Prison Experiment is a story that&apos;s been notably portrayed before, such as the 2001 German film Das Experiment. I remember being a fan of it when I first saw it, but I admit I can&apos;t quite recall it enough to make a comparison here. Nevertheless, this American version which doesn&apos;t make substitutions is a preferable version, one that makes resourceful use of today&apos;s technology and young talent. There&apos;s a dual study going on here. One, the part that writes itself, a document of the actual experiment. And the other, an examination of the ethics of the experimenters. Here is the ugly side of the human condition and our desires to push one another to feel the sweet taste of superiority.\n\nWhile it may lend the obvious yet compelling results of what imaginary power and authority does to people, it still needs to be well executed to work. Fortunately director Kyle Patrick Alvarez and writer Tim Talbott have the right handling of the material, working with great economy in balancing its dichotomy&apos;s. At first it&apos;s disarmingly casual in the way the volunteers are selected and summoned, making a point of its randomizations and often offering an endearing and natural sense of humour. While superficially bleak, it&apos;s having fun with the 70s clothes and oversized moustaches, without peeling back their integrity. But then real tension, real anguish, and a real sensation of danger and dread creeps in and The Stanford Prison Experiment becomes deeply unsettling in its dehumanization techniques. With a careful sense from Alvarez of how far to escalate each sequence, it rings true to human sensibilities of what would happen in this unique situation. There&apos;s always a reminder that it isn&apos;t real, but it doesn&apos;t stop you from feeling unbearably trapped. This is nature at work, combined with a touch of modern cruelty.\n\nThere is a tendency in the film&apos;s inherent and forgivably episodic narrative that it gets you attached to a character they&apos;re focusing on only due to their upcoming exit. Thereby the film loses steam bit by bit. It gradually wins you back afterwards, but each time it takes a little longer. Ezra Miller in particular is a highlight of the first half of the film, formulating some of the most memorable instances of the prisoner&apos;s rebellions and reluctances. He&apos;s missed, but his absence only breeds more tension and vulnerability as we&apos;re left with weaker willed volunteers. If anything, this film is an impressive display of the best talent from the next generation of actors. Hopefully all to soon be familiar faces; Johnny Simmons, Tye Sheridan, Brett Davern, and a guard with the most inventive choice of wording, Michael Angarano, all stick out among other strong performances. While a crowded ensemble does mean no character gets to be fleshed out to their full potential, Alvarez and Talbott at least give room for everyone a time to shine without any dim spots.\n\nOn the experimenters end, Billy Crudup is perfect casting as Dr. Zimbardo. Donning a beard that gives him an uncanny resemblance to Satan, it doesn&apos;t remove that trustworthy glint of compassion in his eyes. His usual warmth is countered by his malicious intent to shove the volunteers to their limits and it creates an enthralling inner conflict where he&apos;s finding his own limits. The film admittedly does lack a female presence giving the nature of 24 volunteers and all the scientists being men. Its only example is Olivia Thirlby as Zimbardo&apos;s girlfriend who later involves herself in the experiment and becomes a voice of reason, but a very welcome one. It may have blind spots and a few stumbles, but it doesn&apos;t hinder what the film does right. As I was completely wrapped in its deft and dense confrontations, I kept waiting for the film to explode. Perhaps recalling the more gritty approach Das Experiment took to its second half, instead this implodes, which is a much more restrained and satisfying conclusion to watch these invisible social constructs dissolve rather than erupt.\n\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment&apos;s wealth of strong material and performances are matched by its technical ambitions. The slick photography makes it cinematic with liberal collages of close-ups and swift camera moves but still keeping it intimate. When the scene calls for rigid obedience, any time the camera moves out of line we hold our breath. It&apos;s graded with a washed-out atmosphere, relishing in the moody darkness. I&apos;ve been irritated with indie films that abuse a shallow depth of field in their photography for no good reason, but this film uses it to isolate you in its grasp and as a result the film shook me up for the rest of the day. While it gets under the skin of the prisoners and the scientists, I did find myself wanting to get behind the motivations of the guards, the most vocal contributors of the experiment. Instead, thats saved for an epilogue that feels like a wise afterthought, but it&apos;s a powerful note on the personal experiments we run just because the opportunity is there. The Stanford Prison Experiment is an ideal taut psychological thriller that bristles with youthful energy and will mostly likely remain standing as one of the best of the year.\n\n8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Film is a rehash of every cross-cultural romance we&apos;ve seen, from Chennai Express to 2 States, but without the wit or emotional heft. The music by Sachin-Jigar is the only saving grace. The writing lacks depth, rushing through Sundari&apos;s personal struggles and Param&apos;s motivations, leaving zero emotional stakes. Speaking about performances Sidharth Malhotra sleepwalks through his role as Param, delivering the same one-dimensional charm he&apos;s leaned into for years. There&apos;s no spark or growth in his performance, and his chemistry with Janhvi feels like a polite handshake at best. Janhvi tries harder as Sundari, but her exaggerated Malayali accent and inconsistent portrayal make her character feel more like a caricature than a person. The supporting cast offers fleeting moments of levity, but even they can&apos;t salvage the weak script. The humor, relying heavily on outdated North-South stereotypes was cringe-inducing and borderline patronizing. The pacing is another letdown. The first half drags with repetitive gags that rarely land, and the second half, while slightly better, stumbles into a rushed, unsatisfying climax. The love triangle subplot feels tacked on, and the emotional beats, like Sundari&apos;s family conflicts, are so underdeveloped they barely register. Even the much-hyped Kerala visuals, while pretty, feel like a glossy tourism ad rather than an integral part of the story.\n\nOverall a lackluster execution. It&apos;s not offensively bad, just painfully forgettable .",

      "reviewBody": "I wanted to hate this movie. Everything from the constant squealing of &quot;Oh My God&quot;, the stream of clichés and the sheer ridiculousness of some of the dialouge pointed in the direction of a complete waste of time. Somehow however, Aquamarine managed to win me over through charm and its child like determination to please. The movie centers around two teenage girls (Emma Roberts and JoJo) who are spending their last summer together before Hayley (Jojo) moves away to Austrailia. Their summer takes a surprising twist when they discover a mermaid (Sara Paxton) in a pool after a terrible storm. They spend the rest of the summer trying to help her find true love. Both Emma Roberts and Jojo are newcomers to the screen and do a surprisingly good job at playing bubbly girls without making the audience want to wring their necks 10 minutes in and though each have yet to develop their skills especially at showing a wide range of emotions, they certainly are charming and enjoyable to watch. Sara Paxton looks and talks the part and though this role wasn&apos;t one to exhibit any real acting abilities she embraces the part full on. Yes, Aqaumarine features a mean blonde girl and yes there is the &quot;hot&quot; guy but if you watch this movie for exactly what it is, a fluffy escape from life, then it shouldn&apos;t bother you. So if you are ever in the mood, wait until it comes out on video and don&apos;t pay 10 dollars on it, it is definitely a rental.",

Yeah, this movie is one of those.\n\nHere&apos;s the premise: A group of people get to film an old lady in the struggle of an early diagnosed Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Her behavior is getting worse really fast, but it seems something else is going on with her, something evil...\n\nJill Larson is the best actress in the movie. She really nails her character. Anne Ramsay follows, then the rest of the acting is okay I guess.\n\nNow, the problem with this movie is mainly about rational behavior of the characters. You know, when you are looking for someone confused in the house, it works better with the lights on. But here noooo, that wouldn&apos;t be scary enough. The group could also make sure to tell her they are coming and are looking for her, but it feels like they are almost hiding from her. Then when we find the lost lady or something scary, we also get a bonus unrelated scary sound, to make sure the jump scares are effective. \n\nSome scenes can get pretty exciting sometimes, but don&apos;t hope to find anything extraordinary with this movie, you&apos;d be disappointed. If you&apos;re looking for a barely decent found footage/mockumentary flick, you can give this one a chance. Just don&apos;t think too much about logic in this movie, because it is pretty much inexistent.",

I enjoyed every minute of our protagonists (a traditional French couple) trying to cope with their 4 daughters marrying men of non- French origins: an African, an Arabic, a Jew, and a Chinese. \n\nAs a negative note, I would say some of the actors are a little weak and/or the scenes are a little forced, but you&apos;ll forget it quickly enough when you are caught bursting into laughter over and over again. \n\nI could not recommend it highly enough.

Normally I adore Maggie Smith, but here the director is so astute, Maggie becomes Medlock and makes your blood boil with her officiousness and her thin-lipped inability to see or feel for the children. Luckily they all fend for themselves and create a world both unbelievable and wholly needed in our dry and hurried lives.  It is for films like these that I go to the theater.  It is because of stories like these that my sleep is peopled with gorgeous landscapes and interesting remarks."

I hadn&apos;t read up on this story, because I wanted to watch the movie not knowing any details. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was not what I was expecting. I went in thinking it would be a Pablo Escobar kinda movie, but it was not. It&apos;s about a teenager trying to figure out how to survive living in a low income part of Detroit. It was heart wrenching, and even had some very funny parts. It also had some parts that made you shake your head and say, &quot;what is he thinking?&quot; In my opinion, it&apos;s definitely worth the watch. Also, I was completely blown away by Richie Merritt&apos;s performance. Especially since this was the first time he&apos;s acted, ever.",

      "reviewBody": "The opinion on IMDb on this film seems to be pretty split and the reason appears to be because many are not writing their opinions of the film so much as they are reviewing Biggie and/or hip-hop itself. So the unquestioning 10* reviews rave about the man and his music, while the 1* reviews talk more about the aspects of the music and culture he represents than they do about the film. I was curious to see what the film was like on its own merits so I made an effort to see it recently. The truth of the matter that the film is &quot;ok&quot; but not anything more than that – and I say that as a hip-hop listener who likes more east coast than west coast.\n\nThe problem with the film is that it is far to driven by ticking boxes of people and events. As a result it doesn&apos;t flow so much as it does introduce people and things in a way that the audience will recognise. This is all well and good but it breaks up the film as a dramatic piece – for example with Lil&apos; Kim, she is not allowed to just be part of the story, no, when she is introduced we even get a shot of her name badge so we can all be sure from the start as to who she is. It is like this with events as well, and the dialogue is surprisingly expositional in its nature with far too many characters seemed to be talking just for the sake of filling in blanks or moving to the next scene. As a sort of summary of Biggie&apos;s career this is fine I suppose but when it comes to caring about the characters then it does hurt it quite bad.\n\nNot that the film is overly concerned with the characters because the events-driven script doesn&apos;t really have any. Before anyone messages me with insults, I can see that there are physically people on the screen there, doing and saying things as these people, but in terms of character development and depth there is none. Nobody ever feels real – partly because of the dialogue but also because the material doesn&apos;t give anybody room to develop. This is best seen in the &quot;second-tier&quot; characters such as Puffy and the many women in Biggie&apos;s life but it comes over differently with Biggie himself. Contrary to his musical personae, the film does not play up the negative side of Biggie&apos;s life too much. It cannot completely hide it though and we do get lots of infidelity and things like him happily selling crack to a pregnant woman. However all of these things tend to be deliberately cancelled out later on in some daft and unnecessary scenes. For example we get to see the crack user years later, fine and playing with her child (also fine) and of course much is put right by conversations, commitments and phone calls on the night that he gets killed. Such things damage the film further as both a record and as a dramatic film – I didn&apos;t want &quot;warts &amp; all&quot; but an edge of realism and criticism (where warranted) would have been good.\n\nIt might be them or it might be the material but either way, the cast are not that great. Woolard does a solid impersonation of Biggie and deal well with the material but he has nowhere to go with his character other than the specifics of the scene – there is not a man inside his performance so much as an image of a man. Luke and Bassett are both very talented actors but neither gets to showcase that here – indeed Luke is only memorable for how well he nails Puffy&apos;s dancing style. Naughton&apos;s Lil Kim sticks in the mind for reasons other than her performance (although again as an impression it is good enough for here). Smith, Ringgold, Mackie and others just do the basics as the film gives them no other options.\n\nThe end result is a film that looks good and covers a lot of ground but doesn&apos;t work as a dramatic film. The people and events are there but they are only ever names and things that happen – never real people or events that come from the story. The cast turn in solid but not that good performances accordingly but nobody can raise it beyond what it is. Not &quot;bad&quot; generally but just really lacking over what I would have expected from a biopic."

It took something as historical as the Wachowski Brothers to knock it off its perch.\n\n&quot;Dead or Alive&quot; features action sequences about on-par with &quot;Mortal Kombat,&quot; dialogue scenes that are only slightly more painful, and the added presence of Eric Roberts, which takes two full points off its IMDb rating just for attaching his name to it.\n\nI didn&apos;t hate DOA; it was miles better than &quot;Mortal Kombat: Annihilation&quot; and director Corey Yuen (&quot;Transporter,&quot; &quot;So Close&quot;) is certainly light-years better than Uwe Boll, if that even means anything.\n\nSlightly better than your average rental, but not worth a $7 movie ticket.

There are various layers like revenge, a psychological disorder, eagerness to know about roots and corporate greed. There are a few amazing screenplay tricks in the movie. Director Sukumar added 20% more commercial appeal to what needed for a psychological thriller, but stayed with the theme of the film most of the times. The length of the film should have been taken care of and the screenplay should have been crisp and racy. There are certain issues with the film - heroine interaction in Goa episodes appear repetitive and there is no scope for songs in this kind of thriller. Sukumar has followed Hollywood style and orientation by narrating the film in a classy way. We do expect the death of villain as the final frame of a typical Telugu movie. But there is a lot to the story after the villain&apos;s death. I loved the way he connected the titles episode of the film to the climax and how parents faces are revealed. There is lot of detailing in the film and some people might need a second viewing to understand the nuances and innuendos in the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Three years after the events of the previous &apos;District 13&apos; film things have not improved in the District despite promises made at the time. Now a corrupt minister is planning to expel the inhabitants and demolish the buildings so profitable redevelopment can take place. To this end his has a shadowy agency raise tensions and turn public opinions against the inhabitants of the district. They have honest cop Captain Damien Tomaso arrested on a trumped-up charge and murder two other officers before making it look as if they were killed in the District. Unbeknownst to them the killing was filmed; when they realise this the go after the witness but he has passed the recording to Leito. Damien manages to call Leito but before he can do anything he must get away from the security forces. Once reunited Damien and Leito set about exposing the truth and saving the community; to do this they will have to unite the various groups living in the district.\n\nIt must be said the story isn&apos;t that deep and the villains couldn&apos;t be more obviously bad... that doesn&apos;t matter though. The story is just an excuse to give great scenes of parkour and martial arts action... and it really delivers these well. David Belle is amazing in the parkour scenes and Cyril Raffaelli is great in his martial arts scenes; these combine to give the film a feel similar to Hong Kong action films without it feeling as though the makers were copying that formula. The main cast is solid in the &apos;acting&apos; as well as action scenes. The ending is a little disappointing; especially when we only hear distant explosions rather than seeing them... at least they weren&apos;t rendered in poor CGI. Overall this might not be a great film but it is a lot of fun and definitely delivers if you want action and a degree of humour.\n\nThese comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles.",

      "reviewBody": "So this is now essentially the third attempt to bring GI Joe to the big screen. Lorenzo Di Bonaventura returns at the helm and proves once again - he does not really care... Honestly - how this film actually came to be is beyond me - a group of professional people working in the industry collectively decided that firstly : this film should be made - then that Evan Spiliotopoulos (who has hardly written a single great film to date) should write the damn thing - then add a director, Schwentke (who has a track record of terrible blockbuster films) - and let&apos;s top it off with TV travel host/Rom-com break out - Henry Golding to play Snake eyes himself. Shocking....\n\nSO - It definitely is not the Snake eyes that people know and love. He does bad things in this film and unfortunately, Henry isn&apos;t a skilled enough actor to make you like him. I disagree that it was purely in the writing - a great actor can make you care for the most despicable characters but Golding proves here he should stick to Rom-coms...and his own accent. His physical skills and acting feel forced and awkward and in my opinion needs a lot of work if I would ever buy him as a legitimate action star. He does have some charisma and good looks though.\n\nIt seems like the majority of the articles and social media agree that the film&apos;s saving grace is Andrew Koji&apos;s Storm Shadow. He adds nuance and depth to Tommy (even though he is dealt the rough hand with having to deliver the majority of the exposition) He commands the screen whenever he is on and delivers us the most layered Storm Shadow in almost any medium to date - just too bad he is let down by an awful script. Koji steals the show with his performance and to top it off you can tell he knows how to move - his action moments were by far the most fun to watch - although he was let down by a terrible filming style there too. I definitely want to see more of Koji. Jin Sakai for Ghost of Tsushima!\n\nThe rest of the cast are great in their limited roles - Samara, Ursula, Iko and Peter Mensah - all do great. They are well cast but under utilised. Hollywood SERIOUSLY needs to stop thinking they know best with martial arts action sequences - Iko and Kenji Tanigaki&apos;s team is absolutely wasted here.\n\nThere was a lot of potential with a GI Joe reboot. There was some potential for a good Snake eyes film - but these people clearly are not the right people to do it. Paramount needs to learn. You would have thought Lorenzo etc would have learnt something since the last films 10 years ago - but clearly not. They have not only destroyed many people&apos;s favourite character - they have simple made a bad film and wasted a lot of money and talent....\n\n5.5/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Films experiencing production hell are rarely as good as they might have been, no matter how good the director is (c.f. Gangs of New York and AI) and this one is no exception.\n\nTaken on its own terms, Tales of Earthsea is a competent, if not breathtaking, start for Miyazaki junior, and bears comparison to the lesser Gibli canon without scaling the heights of its major work. It is unfair to compare it to My Cousin Totoro, Spirited Away or Graveyard of the Fireflies; but it is also a shame for the fans of Earthsea. They didn&apos;t get a top director at the top of his game.\n\nThe principal problem with the film is that it doesn&apos;t seem to know what to do with the books it is based on. Are they source material to be pillaged? Are they stories to be adapted? Are they concepts to be explored? In the end Miyazaki opts for a mix: the narrative structure is broadly based on the third novel (The Farthest Shore), with a significant sub-plots from both the first (The Wizard of Earthsea) and the fourth (Tehanu). Into the mix he throws some recognisable manga/anime formulae (the arch-enemy; the ronin henchmen; the violence) which cut across the major themes explored by the novels and alluded to by the film.\n\nIf this all sounds like a disaster, it isn&apos;t exactly. The plot functions: evil wizard, through pride, upsets the balance of Earthsea forcing archmage, Sparrowhawk, in the company of a young prince, to do battle to restore the balance, destroy the evil and face down their own demons. Had Miyazaki been more ruthless all would probably have been well  for anime fans anyway. But there are too many blind alleys, lose ends and needless distractions  all nods to the books - which make the first half of the film in particular feel like a second rate brass band meandering painfully around a Brassed Off version of Adagio for Strings. The narcotic Hazia, for example, which dominates the beginning of the third story, is introduced early in the film and then simply abandoned. Later, Tenar&apos;s back-story fades into nothingness leaving the audience with a forcible impression of a producer impatiently looking at his watch. The whole effect is not homage, but distraction  and a film that it is at least 40minutes longer than it needed to be.\n\nUrsula LeGuin, who wrote the Earthsea novels, had suggested to (Hayao) Miyazaki that he create new story for Ged, uncluttered by her previous stories, set in the many years between the first two books. This would have made for a less ponderous film.\n\nRegarding the technical side of animation; it appears the younger Miyazaki was aiming for the dreamlike quality of animation so characteristic of his father&apos;s work. Again, he has some partial success in this regard, although it is undeniably more clunky than other Gibli titles. But a lot can be forgiven for his reliance on hand-drawn animation, and there are some moments of real beauty  windblown grasses, rocks on the seashore and chill sunsets. This, along with some strong characters and a much tighter second half, make Tales from Earthsea watchable film, if a slightly underwhelming one. But better than Disney. 6/10",

While I waited for one week for the reviews before confirming if the movie is watchable, the movie stood tall in all aspects. Anu Kapoor is back with a bang with some impressive performances by Ayushman and Yami. The movie provided the right perspective to look at sperm donation and its importance. Though the conservatives with frown at such issues, even from the entertainment point of view, the movie provides everything that audience expects from a movie. The punches are spot on in terms of timing as well as dialogs. While a majority of the dialogs are in Punjabi (which might repel certain set of audiences), it just improves the originality of the plot. Music has been another highlight of the movie with the song &quot;Paani Da Rang&quot; being the masterpiece. Overall, a good 2-3 times watch.",

With this simple story line, &quot;Taxi&quot; is a very silly movie, but I laughed a lot. The greatest attraction for me was certainly the debut of the Brazilian top model Gisele Bündchen as &quot;actress&quot;. But indeed Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon carry this dumb, ridiculous and absurd story in a very funny way. Another funny situation for the Brazilian viewers is to hear Ana Cristina de Oliveira speaking Portuguese with a strong accent from Portugal as if she were Brazilian. I laughed a lot with her pronunciation in Portuguese, which sounds very funny for us. I totally disagree with comments like &quot;the worst movie ever made&quot;, probably made by persons without sense of humor as commented by another IMDb user. &quot;Austin Powers&quot; movies, just as an example, are dumber and less funny than &quot;Taxi&quot;. If the viewer does not have much expectation about this film, he or she may probably have a good time. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Taxi&quot;",

Nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning. The three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together. The writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes. This is a good film that I probably won&apos;t remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy. Good film.",

      "name": "Casey&apos;s Movie Mania: STOLEN (2012)",
      "reviewBody": "Zero fanfare, barely-there 141 theaters count in the U.S. (a surprise, considering it&apos;s a movie starring Nicolas Cage and directed by Simon West of CON AIR and THE EXPENDABLES 2 fame), and scathing reviews -- everything about STOLEN spells rotten. Many have even lambasted this as among the worst Nicolas Cage movie he&apos;s ever acted. Personally, I don&apos;t blame them for being so harsh since Nicolas Cage&apos;s movies nowadays are mostly rubbish. But surprisingly, STOLEN isn&apos;t as bad as I thought. It isn&apos;t good either, but rather a fairly worthwhile action thriller.\n\nThe movie follows Will Montgomery (Nicolas Cage), a master thief who has been sent to prison for 8 years after being double-crossed by one of his partners (M.C. Gainey) in a $10 million robbery gone awry. Upon his release, he plans to leave his criminal past behind and attempts to rekindle his shaky relationship with his estranged daughter, Alison (Sami Gayle). However, FBI agents Tim Harlend (Danny Huston) and Fletcher (Mark Valley) are both convinced that Montgomery must have stashed the $10 million somewhere before he was arrested. But Montgomery insists he&apos;s already burned all the money before he surrendered himself, so his prison sentence will be significantly reduced. Soon, it doesn&apos;t take long before Montgomery&apos;s past comes back to haunt him when his former partner, Vincent (Josh Lucas), who is long thought to be dead, works as a taxi driver and kidnaps Alison. Vincent has been waiting for 8 years to exact revenge against Montgomery, who shots his leg during that fateful robbery, and now he wants the missing $10 million as ransom. Montgomery is given 12 hours to retrieve the money at all cost, or Vincent will kill Alison. As time running out, Montgomery has no choice but to go back his old self again and re-teams with his another partner, the beautiful Riley Jeffers (Malin Akerman) to pull off a bank heist.\n\nSTOLEN plays strictly by-the-numbers, and it&apos;s terribly clichéd all over the place. David Guggenheim&apos;s screenplay is full of implausibilities, and the characters are all caricatures at best. But the movie&apos;s ludicrous tone has somehow plays out fairly good to its advantage. Thanks to Simon West&apos;s energetic direction, the movie zips along fast enough. Frankly, watching STOLEN is akin to watching a mindless &apos;90s action movie -- enjoyable as long as you put your logic aside. The action are quite entertaining , especially given its $35 million low-budget cost (the opening heist scene and the car chase scene inside the parking lot comes to mind), even though they tend to get a bit distracted by its fast editing. Mark Isham&apos;s score is catchy and entertaining enough, but its snappy tone that favors over its caper genre does sounds awkward during its more dramatic moments.\n\nActing-wise, Nicolas Cage plays the same old character we have seen too many times before -- twitchy, that is. But at least, it&apos;s not as worst as critics might lead you to believe here. Josh Lucas certainly has a field day playing an over-the-top, crazy psychopath while both Danny Huston and Mark Valley make quite a worthwhile comic-relief pair as two buffoonery FBI agents. Malin Akerman puts up a thankless role here, which is nothing more than showcasing her beauty and little else.\n\nWhile STOLEN won&apos;t top anyone&apos;s list as one of the must-see action movies of the year, at least it delivers adequate supply of guilty-pleasure entertainment.",

First jump scare was so good lady next to me spilled her full bag of popcorn and tipped over her drink...we laughed and laughed...then the usher came.\n\nI had the movie pegged to go in another direction but I guess the joke was on me, and everyone I was with thought the movie was going in the same direction I thought, so it was pleasant surprise that it was not that predictable.\n\nOverall 5.5 is good, watchable, scary enough. More psychological than it was Horror or Terror.\n\nIt was a little light on the Horror, and there was 1 single plot line, but still enjoyed it.",

When Nick (Eric Christian Olsen) and Shawn (Nicholas D&apos;Agosto) decide to go to cheer camp instead of football camp, they find themselves with three hundred horny girls and their entire world turned-upside-down.\n\nShawn falls for Carly (Sarah Roemer; recognized from Disturbia) and Nick falls for Diora (Molly Sims), who is married to the leader of the camp. At the halfway point of the movie, the film turns over a new leaf, as well as Nick and Shawn, and becomes something more than your average teen comedy about sex and stupid jokes.\n\nI laughed quite a bit more than I expected to when I saw the trailer for the movie. Bits shown in the trailer do not do the comedy of the film justice. It is so much more than just a comedy, as well, it&apos;s a warm tale that proves anyone can do anything if they just believe in themselves.\n\nIt&apos;s inspiring, laughable, fun and romantic all-in-one. Aside from some profanities and small nudity, it&apos;s for all audiences, I think.",

      "reviewBody": "Some movies only work if we let ourselves carry away by them. They present a surrealistic imagination world that comes from the mind of their creators. They are hard to watch, especially when they mix real characters that live their lives sometimes awaken, or inside one big dream or their own dreams.\n\nAxel Blackmar (Johnny Depp) is a dreamer, and an unusual example of personal choices. His parents died and he went to New York, to work with fish. He could have sold cars with his uncle Leo (Jerry Lewis), but he&apos;s there, talking with that monotonous voice about what he does. Maybe it was a simple dream, where an Eskimo catches a fish with two eyes on the same side, and tells his kids to go out with their dog so he and his wife canAnd the kid with the dog allow to see an orange balloon that seems to go from Alaska to New York, where Alex sleeps in a truck. &quot;Wake up, Columbus&quot;, the words of his mother and Axel&apos;s hope to find something in the land already discovered by that man.\n\nAlongside fish flying through the air, we join Axel to be the best man of his uncle&apos;s wedding. With his friend Paul Leger (Vincent Gallo), the untiring chats go from movies to philosophies about cakes, pies and bananas. Paul is an actor: &quot;I&apos;m having a great performance on Friday&quot;, he says. &quot;It&apos;s an audition&quot;, Axel says to humiliate him. The truth is that it&apos;s not even an audition. This stuff lived by Axel is a story for us, but is a personal rediscovering and rethought of decisions in life for the character. When he sees Elaine (Faye Dunaway) he feels something strong, but doesn&apos;t know how to call it. Days later he becomes the lover of a woman decades older than him. Elaine&apos;s daughter, Grace (Lili Taylor) is also there, and it doesn&apos;t goes long until Axel finds himself in a crossroad between the heart of two women, that as he describes them, are &quot;too similar and big to be in the same world&quot;.\n\nDavid Atkin&apos;s story and screenplay comes plagued of phrases that could come out of a lunatic&apos;s mouth, but they fit in the film&apos;s context and twist your head at maximum. &quot;I&apos;ve got to climbIt&apos;s a long way to the moon&quot;; &quot;I&apos;m gonna live forever until I become a turtleThey have infinite lives&quot;, besides scenes of well known movies in crucial moments. And what music (Goran Bregovic)! And what editing (Andrija Zafranovic)! And what cinematography (Vilko Filac)! And what director! Known for his originality, recognized director Emir Kusturica puts his own signature to his movie, collaborating in the story he must have dreamed a little to; giving life to the dream with his flying camera, full of unexpected turns and in love of its surroundings. What he achieves is greater words, although not everybody could understand it, and, for that matter, appreciate it.\n\nAnd his actorsJerry Lewis in a total comprehension of his character, and so involved in his work that you wouldn&apos;t believe it. So incredibly likable in one of those roles we never give much importance to. Faye DunawayWow! She got to work with some of these actors later, but here, as an old woman in character and, with respect, in person, she maintains that virtue of creating uniqueness, with her laughs, smiles and way of saying things. Lili Taylor was the most interesting character here. The silent daughter that could be crazy but no one can really tell. With imagination and freedom, Taylor makes her character believable and not as overacted as it might be. Vincent Gallo, who I respect mostly as a director and as an actor that does what he wants, the ability he has had to choose his roles is visible here again; as he shines without lights to help him. A wonderful performance his fans shouldn&apos;t miss.\n\nBut DeppHow can I explain? I&apos;ve said it a lot, surely, but I will repeat it. He&apos;s like a magician, but not with the cards and the hat and the tricks. He is with his face, his looks, his way of talking, his perfection of movementBut it&apos;s not really something technical: &quot;in the acting world, Johnny Depp is a magician&quot;. I&apos;m sure he still has plenty of that for us, but here is where he let us know first.\n\nIn one scene, Vincent Gallo&apos;s character Paul, an actor, requests that no one touches his face, because it&apos;s important. &quot;Do you think they touch Brando&apos;s face? Do you think they touch Pacino&apos;s, De Niro&apos;s? Do you think they touch Johnny Depp&apos;s face? I don&apos;t know then, but not know; and if they did before, they shouldn&apos;t have.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Proof&quot;, the excellent play by David Auburn, was one of the best things in the New York stage in recent memory. Part of the attraction was the intelligent subject matter, math science, and how it connected the four characters one got to meet. The casting was an ideal one, Mary Louise Parker, Larry Briggman, Johanna Day and Ben Shenkman, playing Cahterine, Robert, Claire and Hal, respectively.\n\nMr. Auburn and Rebecca Miller, a movie director, herself, took the task of adapting &quot;Proof&quot; for the screen. The result, directed by John Madden, opens the play in cinematic terms, no small undertaking in presenting the movie to a wider audience who might not be interested in science, and much less in the advanced math that plays an important role in the proceedings.\n\nIf you haven&apos;t seen the film, please stop reading here.\n\nCatherine, the 27 year old, at the center of the film, is a woman who has stayed behind to take care of her aging father, a man much esteemed in academic circles, who is suffering from, perhaps, a neurological illness that is killing him slowly. Catherine has, in a way, sacrificed her life in order to see that Robert spends his last days at home instead of at an institution.\n\nThe death of the father brings Claire home. This woman, who lives in New York, wants to get rid of everything connected with her father. She even has made plans for Catherine to move from Chicago to be near each other in New York, where things are much better. To complicate things, Harold, the nerdy math student, finds a hidden notebook that might contain a discovery that will revolutionize math. The only problem is the proof might not have been the dead man&apos;s own creation.\n\n&quot;Proof&quot; works as a film because of Mr. Madden&apos;s direction. We are kept involved in what is going on because we have been won by Catherine, the wounded woman trying to live her life without having to tend to a sick man. Catherine love for math, in a way, makes her realize her place is in the same institution where her father made mathematical discoveries as she will be following his steps.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow makes an excellent Catherine, a role she had played on the London stage. Ms. Paltrow is a welcome presence in the movie because of the intelligence she projects when working with a good director like John Madden. In fact, it has been a while since we saw this actress in a film.\n\nHope Davis, another excellent actress, plays Claire, the materialistic sister who has arrived and who wants to transform the frumpy Catherine and mold her to her own taste. Ms. Davis has accustomed us to expect a valuable contribution to any film in which she plays. As Claire, she clearly understand who this character she is portraying really is.\n\nAnthony Hopkins has only a few good moments on the screen. Jake Gyllenhaal&apos;s character Harold is not as effective as Ben Shenkman&apos;s was on the stage. In fact, Mr. Gyllenhaal, with his dark good looks, seems to be someone who would not be interested in math at all.\n\n&quot;Proof&quot; is an immensely rewarding film thanks to what John Madden&apos;s vision.",

      "reviewBody": "Nipsel and company basically hybridized the structure of Dances with Wolves with a not-quite-historical fiction (more like radical speculation) plot about interactions between Norsemen and Native Americans during the 12th century A.D.\n\nGhost (Karl Urban) is a Norse boy left behind aboard a wrecked ship. He is adopted by the Clan of the Dog (the dogs who cohabitate with this tribe are historically inaccurate, but that&apos;s just one of many historical transgressions). As he grows up, Ghost&apos;s obvious difference and his history become something of a stumbling block for him, but he works hard to overcome them in order to be accepted by his adoptive people. Eventually, it seems, he must confront the demons of his past, and unfortunately, so must the Clan of the Dog.\n\nPathfinder is played well by Russell Means, and Ghost&apos;s love interest - Starfire - is nicely portrayed by Moon Bloodgood. Urban has great physical talent, but this story did not lend itself to testing his ability to create drama and mood, so there isn&apos;t much to say about his performance. Likewise, most of the Norse characters were so under-developed and one-dimensional that it is impossible to comment on the performances involved.\n\nAlthough the story relies on stereotypes to develop both its Norse and Native American characters, since so little is actually known about the Norse colonies, this seems forgivable. What is not really forgivable, in my opinion, is the reiteration of the trope established in Dances with Wolves and other similar works which suggests that it takes a European to effectively fight off Europeans. Although the characterizations of the protagonists in both films are adequate to explain their behavior, the character and behavior of the Native Americans attached to them is less well developed, and there is a lingering, inaccurate and disturbing shadow of inferiority implied in their apparent inability to strategize and effectively lead in combat.\n\nHowever, Pathfinder refuses to touch reality with any length of pole, so, sit back and enjoy the action, costumes and sets.\n\nThe film contains a lot of violence, most of which is convincingly shot. The costuming is excellent, and the sets are lovely. if you can get past the problems - which are several - you may just enjoy it.",

      "reviewBody": "I have read a number of reviews on this movie and they are accurate and good for the most part. My credit is to Gary Goddard for all he endured and still getting a credible and succinct movie made.\n\nThe fight scenes are real and actual so they seem methodical but they&apos;re great. The hair, clothing, make-up, special effects, and down the list we go, is so caked in &apos;80s gunk it would be hard to fight for this as a classic. It is the only He-Man movie out there, and although a sequel beckons, eighteen years have passed without a stir.\n\nIf a sequel were to made Langella would have to be Skeletor. I mean the best acting from both he and Lundgren comes when He-Man is being led by the Centaurian. Langella saying &quot;I give you a choice: return to Eternia with me as my slave and save their despicable lives, or perish with them here on this tasteless, and primitive, planet.&quot; It&apos;s cold and dark and it&apos;s authentic. It&apos;s chilling and you get chills. Langella overacts sometimes but mostly is great. He took Skeletor from a whiny, irritating, and downright pathetic worm of a guy to a believable, earthy, credible, and despicable evil-doer. We get a taste of the importance of He-man and all that he does, here in this scene, too.\n\nGoddard did something brilliant here, he made the movie personable. He puts these people on Earth, interacting with Earthlings, and putting a grasp on how out there these &quot;aliens&quot; are. But it is also probably why this movie is so widely disregarded, because it doesn&apos;t have great and illustrative fight scenes. Instead they are sensible and plotted. To see this movie remade could be a real treat.\n\nGwildar is, essentially, Orco. He was easy, sensible, irritating, but not nearly as annoying, and unfairly Billy Barty was nominated for a Razzie. The story interlocks with this missing &quot;key&quot; as created by Gwildar. This cosmos idea of God-like power through the manifestation of a fourth dimension is highly advanced. This is why the movie is good. Portals are doors and He-Man is definitely a science fiction adventurer. This puts an Earthy spin on an idea wiling out.\n\nTeela works and Man-in-Arms (Duncan) is good as a faithful sidekick to He-Man. That&apos;s what he is. He can hold his own but mostly is fighting for duty of right, and he follows He-Man for he is the epitome of it. Teela&apos;s gritty and pitched voice, with her desperate actions, are very formidable. Duncan is best when inspiring Kevin. Kevin is a sensitive guy with a talent. What these Eternians do is showcase pessimism on Earth for their planet is dying at their own hands. They are their own good and evil and it is hard to differentiate, so why care? By the end of the movie Courtney Cox and Robert Duncan McNeill (Julie and Kevin) see that. So does Lubic. The Eternians have no planet and yet they continue to hold hope and forge ahead: He-Man. \n\nTolkan is not so much a distraction as he is pretentious. McNeill yelling to Tolkan &quot;Lubic this is for real&quot; as he dodges a Centaurian blast doesn&apos;t hold much weight, or reality. It is about unity, division, and strength. Both literal and figurative.\n\nMeg Foster is great as Evil-Lyn because she improves the movie rather than take time from Skeletor. Goddard lets most of the acting chops fall to the incomparable Frank Langella. He-Man is the ambassador of good. He is to talk slow, be level-headed, and search for justice. Lundgren does all of these things. He mission isn&apos;t to be malicious and blood seeking. When he runs into Julie (and a great fight sequence ensues) it is Duncan and Teela doing some leg work. He-Man is a protector. He&apos;ll abate killing Skeletor to keep any and all safe. In all honesty how many lines can you give someone? Someone suggested Brad Pitt as He-Man for a remake. I don&apos;t mind Pitt, but he would ham up the screen like some feel Skeletor did. Skeletor&apos;s was good, He-Man&apos;s would not be. Lundgren, in all honesty, is great. He has a mullet but looks the part, and contrary to popular belief, acts it. He wields the Sword of Grayskull gracefully, yet with force and some clumsiness. It&apos;s heavy, but he&apos;s well-skilled and versed in the sword. These oppositions are found in the Soceress. She would normally seem bad to us; however, she is the greatest power of good. Christina Pickles gives great lines of philosophy allowing for good banter and humor with Skeletor. And her love for He-Man is very evident and clear with solid acting.\n\nThe cartoon is hardly to be found here, aside from the characters and Eternia. Battle cat, and all other characters good and bad, could cloud a remake. But it would be great to see history revealed for He-Man like the new Batman series has done. People forget we like to see depth in our characters. And the character Charlie is filler, not unimportant, but certainly not integral. He&apos;s written well. All in all watch this movie because it&apos;s really, quite engrossing.",

      "name": "With distinct visual style Last Knights is a decent light fantasy flick, although the narrative might feel too familiar and slow",
      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s odd that a medieval fantasy movie with respectable cast nearly flies off radar. Last Knights is not an epic tale, in fact the plot heavily resembles that of 47 Ronin and considering even Keanu Reeves&apos; journey is inspired by multitude of per-existing works, this plot is unoriginal at best. The pacing is slow, creating a rather bloated runtime. Still, the cast as well as cinematography produce nice atmosphere, especially in latter half, just making Last Knights a moderately enjoyable popcorn flick.\n\nRaiden (Clive Owen) is a commander with a dark past, he was taken by his lord Bartok (Morgan Freeman) and granted opportunity to lead the knights. As a man of integrity Bartok openly opposes Minister Gezza Mott (Aksel Hennie), this doesn&apos;t end up well for him as he loses his land and riches, amongst other things. Thus the tale of coping and possible vengeance begins. The premise is far too predictable, more so if you have watched 47 Ronin, the screenplay almost mirrors one another.\n\nClive Owen has the rugged commander look, but he doesn&apos;t seem engaging. I can&apos;t help but seeing the solemn Keanu Reeves&apos; persona as neither of them barely exhibits any meaningful expression. Morgan Freeman is as dependable as ever, he&apos;s charismatic and does pretty much what one expected. As for the villain, Aksel Hennie performs admirably. He does seem corrupt, conniving and slightly paranoid. The script gives him ominous vibe that audience would love to hate.\n\nSupporting cast is oriented towards the mix of European and Asian, props for the casting department to pull off the eclectic assemble. They also have some experience in action movies and TV shows overall, so it&apos;s not all obscure faces. The setting puts emphasis on hybrid culture, architectures and costumes appear to be from ancient Persia with an oriental touch. It&apos;s a quaint atmosphere and presents a few lavish set pieces. Cinematography uses grayish filter for most of these areas and outfits, in exception of certain characters or definitive environment which are more vibrant.\n\nWhile it looks presentable, the plot may deter some audiences. Its script tries to engage with intriguing lines, and it&apos;s mildly successful. Unfortunately, the film spends more than half of its runtime stuttering to find its rhythm. This is made worse by the outdated screenplay, the plot devices are not only foreseeable, they are also heavy-handed in execution.\n\nThe last act fares better as it offers more polished action sequences, although there is no surprise twist to be had here. Last Knights is made from tired elements of the genres, it doesn&apos;t do enough for a fascinating spectacle. However, with a presentable graphic and production design, it&apos;s barely sufficient for a light watch.",

      "reviewBody": "The premise of &quot;Shadow of a Vampire&quot; is simple, what if Max Schreck was really a vampire posing as an actor playing a vampire in the Murnau&apos;s masterpiece, &quot;Nosferatu?&quot; Well, the result is both slightly scary and pretty funny. Director E. Elias Merhige and writer Steven Katz create a fairly creepy mood, and inhabit the picture with some real interesting characters.\n\nJohn Malkovich plays famous silent film director F.W. Murnau. This is perhaps the funniest performance of the bunch, especially when he is giving audible instructions to the &quot;actors&quot; while the camera is rolling. Then, there is Willem Dafoe who plays Max Schreck/ the vampire. It is incredibly fun to watch an almost unrecognizable Dafoe play this oddball, Max Schreck. Unfortunately for Murnau, Schreck starts doing what vampires tend to do... bite people. The original photographer dies along with a few others at the mouth of Schreck. After seeing this movie, it is quite easy to see why Dafoe was nominated for best supporting actor at the Oscars. His performance is worth the price of admission.\n\nThis is a film which is hard to classify, sense it is a fictional account of an actual film with real people. Yet this horror-comedy does have its moments of wonderful macabre humor along with great performances to help make it an enjoyable movie. A 7 out of 10. I highly recommend watching this as part of a double feature. First, watch Murnau&apos;s original 1922 masterpiece, &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, then watch &quot;Shadow of a Vampire.&quot; You will appreciate &quot;Shadow of a Vampire&quot; a lot more (or maybe vice versa).",

Characters couldn&apos;t be more boring and predictable. And the tragic part is,in all of this you could see the potential for a great thriller. It looks like the talentless, behind the scenes moneymakers, once again asserted their rights and ruined yet another movie.

The dialogue is fantastic, the narration is on point and the story line flows very well.\n\nI was gripped to my seat as I watched this film, and I felt a deep connection with each and every soldier on screen.

He was a natural and also pretty much unknown at the time. This remake however had nothing like the effect of the original. Yes maybe because I know whats going to happen even though there are some subtle differences but Sean Bean. I don&apos;t think an actor that well known fits this part. The other annoying thing is that no matter what happens to the kids in the film, Attacked, accused of murder blah blah they still continue to their ultimate destination. Any normal person would ring the police or turn around and go back... DOH !!!! \n\nDon&apos;t bother in my opinion",

Two problems: the film might have been more accurately titled Jason Takes (a cruise to) Manhattan, since he&apos;s ship-bound for all but the final half-hour, and he doesn&apos;t really concern himself with anyone apart from the vessel&apos;s survivors once he&apos;s there. This is a guy who&apos;s made a habit of ruthlessly eviscerating everyone he&apos;s ever encountered, yet now he passes harmlessly through a loaded subway car and cheerfully lifts his mask to scare a gang of punks like a haunted house denizen. Production values have taken a significant step up since Part VII, and the gore feels somewhat less censored, but it&apos;s failed by yet another repetitive, hole-laden plot and a reliably godawful set of actors.",

      "reviewBody": "Zhang Yimou was a very highly regarded filmmaker 5 years ago, before I had ever heard of him. Then he earned a place in my heart by directing both Hero and House of Flying Daggers. With those last two I felt like I was in martial arts movie heaven, so I would instantly be interested in any other future films that could approach those two in scope, talent, and action. Curse of the Golden Flower focuses mostly on the first two of those three traits, but besides, anything starring Chow Yun-Fat will earn my attention like a bullet to the head. I do own The Corrupter after all.\n\nThis is a film about a royal family, rather dysfunctional at that, in the 928 AD Tang Dynasty. Chow Yun-Fat is Emperor Ping, who from the way he handles his family and can anticipate any kind of attack or counterattack seems like quite the ruthless warlord. He has three sons: one is a teenager, who isn&apos;t given much regard but knows more than others think. The eldest of the three is the current crown prince, but doesn&apos;t seem to have any special talents, other than drawing the affections of the wrong women. The middle son is a great warrior and, of course, is now the favorite of the father. But these characters may be just pawns to Empress Phoenix (Gong Li), who is mother to the younger two brothers and step-mother to the eldest. Under normal circumstances she might be a great mother, wife, and Empress, but current circumstances, including a mystery illness, have forced her to take actions involving a secret plot to remove her husband from the throne.\n\nThis is not the action movie some might expect, though there is enough near the end to earn the R rating. It&apos;s basically a family drama, though in a rather fascinating and different setting for such a story. As you&apos;d expect with a royal family, appearances are everything. Anything out of the ordinary has to happen in secret. All the normal everyday stuff is almost mechanical in nature. Whether you see dozens of servants getting up in the morning, or preparing food, or planting flowers, it all occurs in such a fiercely coordinated fashion. It would have been such a hard life, either being a royal or supporting one, but it would be a miserable life if one couldn&apos;t take any pride in what they did.\n\nThe filmmakers who designed and implemented all the sets and costumes should take a hell of a lot of pride in what they do. The family of this story, even while destroying themselves (and therefore their empire) from within, are living in the most lavish accommodations and outfits I&apos;ve ever seen. I usually don&apos;t think much of costuming or set design, but I must say that after seeing Chow Yun-Fat&apos;s golden suit of armor, or anything Gong Li was in, or the design of their personal quarters, I really hope for some Oscar recognition. Perhaps the best I&apos;ve ever seen in those areas.\n\nOverall though, a good film, and a definite must for any Chow Yun-Fat fan to seem him play such a great villain, as with Sammo Hung in Sha Po Lang. It kept me interested throughout, but nothing too surprising happened in regards to story. It basically all went how I imagined it would.",

      "name": "Tom Hiddleston in Kafa-esque nightmare....",
      "reviewBody": "This isn&apos;t one film to take at face value. Very subversive, the film begins with our familiar face of Tom Hiddleston covered in blood in some apartment flat! We then rewind to 3 months back to explain what has happened. Based in some 1970s high-rise block (very 2000AD style), this building was designed as a utopia with the wealthiest settling in the top flats. Instead it turns in a dystopia, as the residents are stuck in some narcissistic and parochial void.\n\nCivil &amp; class war is breaking out and nothing is clear cut. Tom Hiddleston&apos;s character though is dressed and fitted as if he is from 20-30 years later, so it&apos;s too obvious a way for us to relate to him. Anyhow, he has to survive in this world, but gets sucked in.\n\nThis film reminded me of some &apos;horror&apos; videos from the 1990&apos;s, wasn&apos;t uncommon in those days (films like &apos;Society&apos; etc), and it was an interesting change. We have a very surreal look here in this film, and it&apos;s clichéd in style &amp; outlook for the 1970&apos;s (which reflects the vanity of the residents).\n\nDespite the originality, it didn&apos;t work for me. It&apos;s probably 30mins too long and that saps the interest out of it as they stretched the film. Too often you can&apos;t follow what is going on. You never empathise with anyone in this film as they try to live in their own vacuous worlds.\n\nIt&apos;s an interesting film but it definitely will only appeal to a minority, as I guess it was always going to looking at the premise. A minor cult film? Possibly. Won&apos;t be one I&apos;ll revisit.",

      "reviewBody": "There is a winning quality to this romantic comedy about a girl in her 20s (Knightley) in a bit of a mid 20s crisis after being proposed to by her boyfriend. She befriends a teenage girl (Moretz) and her divorced father (Rockwell). It starts off a bit slow but then you realize gradually the characters are all quite likable even when they are doing something wrong. This understated treatment of the more serious moments makes it more effective especially the visit to the mother (Mol). Avoids melodrama which would have spoilt the tone of the movie.\n\nKeira Knightley makes her 20s finding herself girl surprisingly sympathetic and identifiable. Throughout her mistakes you still root for her. Chloe Grace Moretz is a standout as always. She gives a sensitive performance and doesn&apos;t overact. Amidst all the recent movies a likable teenager character on film is kind of rare. Sam Rockwell plays the father quite charmingly.\n\nOverall one the better indie rom coms of late and worth a watch.",

Between Nicole Kidman, Nicolas Cage and Cam Gigandet, I had my hopes set pretty high for a well acted movie; and I was not disappointed in the least. The movie starts off with your typical wealthy family with an angst filled teenage daughter. The marriage of the characters Kyle and Sarah, Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman respectively, seems strained at first, with Sarah&apos;s needs not being met because of Kyle&apos;s being preoccupied with work. When 2 &quot;police officers&quot; come to the house however, terror ensues. A violent hostage situation grips the family and shows how far a father will go for his wife and his daughter. Not only does Nicolas Cage shine as a man with a tortured secret, he embodies how strong a person should be in such a situation. The shocking realism of this movie is bloody, but not too gory, and really thrills you to the last scene. All in all Trespass delivers tenfold and leaves the audience with a final thought: get out, or die trying."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll admit up front that this is likely going to be an unpopular review and a decidedly minority opinion, but I have to be honest about my feelings. Writer-director Sarah Polley&apos;s adaptation of Miriam Toews&apos;s novel of the same name may come from a place of noble intent, and it may feature one of the year&apos;s finest acting ensembles, but its overall treatment is a major misfire. This fact-based story about a group of women from a conservative religious colony who meet to discuss how to respond to a series of sexual assaults in their community unfolds in a circular, wooden, stagey fashion that plays more like a university discussion group than a work of dramatic cinema. The ideas raised in these dialogues - ranging from activism to passivity to intergender relations to forgiveness to faith and salvation - are certainly lofty topics for consideration and deliberation, especially in terms of how they might be addressed in the forging of a new and better world. But their handling here is so forced and inauthentic that the entire exercise lacks believability and does little to foster a sense of concerted viewer engagement. And, as the narrative drones on and on, it becomes tediously dull, with one of the characters herself astutely observing that &quot;This is very, very boring&quot; (well said, if a bit ironic). What&apos;s more, a number of incidents and themes seemingly arise out of nowhere and aren&apos;t always fully resolved, making one wonder why they were included in the first place. Even more disappointing is the fact that the film features so many fine portrayals by performers who are given such stilted material to work with, including Jessie Buckley, Claire Foy, Judith Ivey, Sheila McCarthy, Ben Whishaw and Frances McDormand (whose appearance is more of an afterthought than anything else). Director Polley has certainly made a name for herself with such excellent past works as &quot;Away From Her&quot; (2006), but her reach has certainly exceeded her grasp with this undertaking, one that has much to say but ultimately says so little.",

He has a childish inventiveness that even though often aggravating, is a wonderful thing.\n\nHe has to fake these bad habits in the movie because in reality he&apos;s been such an anti-pop star, as far as being responsible goes. He was quite famous in the 80&apos;s and early 90&apos;s.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe is amazing as Al, it&apos;s one of the best roles I&apos;ve seen him in. The movie is very good. Al&apos;s humor shows through the ridiculous storyline, and Radcliffe seems to understand his humor.\n\nYou have to give Weird Al Yankovich props just for keeping the mustache and halfro/jerry curl\n\nOverall, I just love Weird Al and the movie because he&apos;s so absurd.",

      "reviewBody": "As a fan of action films, particularly the original &quot;Transporter&quot; trilogy featuring Jason Statham, my expectations for &quot;The Transporter Refueled&quot; were quite high. However, after watching this lackluster reboot, I was left feeling disappointed and unfulfilled.\n\nFirst and foremost, the plot was convoluted and felt like a half-hearted attempt to recapture the magic of the original. The story revolves around Frank Martin, now played by Ed Skrein, who must become entangled with a group of femme fatales and a dangerous crime lord. Unfortunately, this premise fails to deliver any genuine tension or excitement. The characters lacked depth and development, making it hard for viewers to become emotionally invested in their fates.\n\nEd Skrein&apos;s portrayal of Frank Martin did not hold a candle to Jason Statham&apos;s iconic performance. While Skrein is undoubtedly a talented actor, he seemed miscast in this role. His interpretation of Frank felt flat and lacked the charisma that made Statham&apos;s character so memorable. This lack of captivating lead performance was a major detriment to the film as a whole.\n\nThe action sequences, a hallmark of the Transporter franchise, were underwhelming at best. Rather than the well-choreographed, adrenaline-pumping stunts that fans had come to expect, the action in &quot;The Transporter Refueled&quot; felt disjointed and over-edited. It was as if the filmmakers relied heavily on shaky cam and quick cuts to disguise the lack of imagination in their fight choreography. This approach only served to frustrate me as a viewer, as it made it difficult to fully appreciate what little talent was on display.\n\nThe film&apos;s pacing seemed erratic. There were moments where the narrative dragged, leaving me checking the runtime, and then suddenly, it would rush through crucial plot developments without providing adequate context or explanation. This uneven pacing kept me disengaged and made it challenging to follow the film&apos;s progression.\n\nThe supporting characters were woefully underdeveloped. The femme fatales, who could have added an intriguing dynamic to the story, were reduced to clichés and stereotypes. Their motivations felt unclear, and their interactions with Frank lacked any real chemistry, making key moments feel forced and dull.\n\nThe film&apos;s attempts to inject humor fell flat and often felt out of place. Instead of providing lighthearted relief, the comedic elements detracted from the tension of the action scenes, leaving me feeling confused about the tone the filmmakers were aiming for.\n\n&quot;The Transporter Refueled&quot; is a disappointing addition to the franchise that fails to capture the essence of what made the original films enjoyable. A weak script, lackluster performances, subpar action, and a muddled tone all contributed to a viewing experience that left much to be desired. For fans of the series, I recommend rewatching the original trilogy instead of enduring this uninspired reboot.",

      "reviewBody": "With 17 million viewers, the 1966 comedic hit &quot;La Grande Vadrouille&quot; reigned on the French box-office for more than four decades. But the king was finally dethroned by a sleeper hit with a catchy title &quot;Bienvenue chez les Ch&apos;tis&quot;, starring Dany Boon and Kad Merad.\n\nBoth actors aren&apos;t on the same league than the iconic Louis de Funès and Bourvil duo. Yet for some reason, the film met with immediate success thanks to  call it as you want, Internet, buzz, word-to-mouth  something that definitely touched the hearts of 20 million viewers, one third of French population, which makes me realize that &quot;La Grande Vadrouille&quot; proportionally did better.\n\nBut let&apos;s not pollute this review with numeracy, like I said for &quot;Intouchables&quot;, the film benefited from the virtual circle of success, becoming a phenomenon, something people came at less to see it, than to see what&apos;s so great about it. And as an aspiring film-maker, I&apos;ve got to hand it to Dany Boon for having have made a film with such an effect. Where &quot;Welcome to the Ch&apos;tis&quot; worked, many others have failed, especially those that tried to follow some guidelines for a successful comedy, I guess what the &quot;Ch&apos;tis&quot; have is called sincerity and good intentions, a sort of Capraesque &apos;feel-good&apos; quality, praising the unique charm of small little towns and their caring and loving inhabitants.\n\nIt&apos;s sincere because the film is set in the North, which is to France what the Midwest is to USA. To avoid repetition, I invite you to check my review of &quot;Les Tuche&quot; to get my idea about the region. Anyway, &quot;Ch&apos;tis&quot; (referring to the inhabitants) had a story to tell, the story of a cocky and arrogant manager sleeping on the laurels of his success under Mediterranean sun until he&apos;s &apos;promoted&apos; to the North, a place full of hard-drinking rednecks with incomprehensible accents, and a sky depressingly gray. The film does exaggerate the reputation of the North and make it sound like a sort of doomed place, I guess this is to be taken in a humorous light, a running gag that should have culminated with Michel Galabru&apos;s cameo, describing with his Southern accent, North as if it was a haunted mansion.\n\nBut as the singer said (quote from the &apos;Tuche&apos; review) : &quot;People from the North have in their eyes the blue lacking in their setting and in their heart the sun that is not shining&quot;. And that&apos;s the shining Philippe (Kad Merad) will discover. It&apos;s a coming-to-realization that thankfully happens very quickly, revealing that the man was prejudiced but not a bigot, he was probably troubled by his marital problems and sleeping in the house of his employee, a gentle postman named Antoine (Dany Boon) didn&apos;t help, nor facing the menacing stare of his mother reminding me of Agnes Skinner, and played by one of the most defining figures of the North: Line Renaud.\n\nThe breakfast is rather disastrous full of Maroualle (a particularly smelly local cheese) cheap coffee, and a series of dialogs whose accents are, so to speak, accentuated to have the same effects on the laughs. My wife, coming from the North, laughed more than me. There had to be a film about the Ch&apos;tis, a sort of adventure in a new world with a heart inside. The ice is finally broken when Pierre decides to follow Antoine during his workday, to prevent him from drinking, naturally he ends up as drunk as him, contributing to the film&apos;s defining picture, an enchanting moment of male-bonding, friendship and mutual understanding. I can&apos;t blame a film for trying to evoke so many positive feelings.\n\nBut the plot weakens when Philippe tries to hide the truth from his wife (Zoé Felix) and to make it worse, she decides to visit him, and then comes a sequence belonging to another film, where all the local people act according to the very stereotypes that insult them, and the wife buys it (not too long, but still). Since the point is to prove that they&apos;re not dumb dim-witted people, would they take part of such a senseless joke if they weren&apos;t? The climax occurs when Antoine finally find the nerve to declare his love from the belfry where he works as the bell-ringer (what was so difficult anyway?), and as if Phillipe&apos;s bell was rang in the same time, he takes the trademark Post yellow trunk to the South in order to apologize to his wife. This is when the film gets too conventional for such a hit, and I felt like cheated a bit.\n\nBut I could have forgiven that if it wasn&apos;t for one thing, one thing the film lacks: a punch line. There&apos;s no comedy without a simple joke, a smile, a laugh at the end, but as if we hadn&apos;t enough emotions, it had to feature the cringe-worthy sight of Philippe weeping like a kid. And Antoine&apos;s triumph &quot;see, we cry twice, when we come and when we leave&quot;, all right, when he told him that on the beach, we could see that coming from a mile, so why not just make an effort to surprise us? A film that ambitious could have at least been kind enough to have a small, a frail, a timid little twist. It&apos;s unfortunate when the funniest scene of the film I spoil (let&apos;s just say, it features a wheelchair) happens so soon in the beginning.\n\nAnd the polemics raised when the film only grabbed one nomination for Best Screenplay earning the Academy of Césars an accusation of snobbishness, against popular cinema, which is not totally untrue, but still, how many nominations &quot;The Visitors&quot; had, or &quot;Amelie&quot;, or &quot;Intouchables&quot; these are far superior film that deserved to be the number one. &quot;Bievenue Chez les Ch&apos;tis&quot; was probably released at the right time, about the right place, and its genuineness touched people. But this is far from being the greatest French comedy ever, simply the highest-grossing.",

Am ok with not connecting with characters but the characters in this movie are hard to understand which is odd because they talk and talk (usually at 100 miles an hour and over each other) so you think they would be all out in the open but it was like a wall between them and me. Like i completely failed to understand what it was that the author was saying about the world or the country when he wrote the book. Though i assume that the book was making some sort of commentary about the state of affairs because this movie feels somewhat too large in scale to just be a movie about coming to term with mortality and the difficulties that can arise in a marriage. Like the movie isn&apos;t bad but what are you? I will watch it again when it comes out on Netflix to try and see it with fresher eyes but if the purpose of the movie is to frustrate people so much that we rewatch it multiple times, i will say that they will succeed.",

      "reviewBody": "I initially wanted to condemn the film as reverse racist after the flag pin remark but I decided to give it a bit more time and ended up watching it to the end. Some say they were disappointed at a slow plodding film that misused the talented Denzel and slapped them with a crappy ending. We were not watching the same film. Here Denzel portrays a man with every possible thing against him: he&apos;s a black man with a presumed Muslim last name, who has an almost autistic nature because of his savant abilities which has repressed his ability to be financially successful because he has no real interest in money and prefers to pursue truth instead. Once scene depicts him well when he appears to be rambling and then slaps us with the conclusion bringing it all together: there is no way to retain purity. Bam. We are hit with Roman&apos;s plight.\n\nIt is these savant abilities that drive him mad in his own mind while his simplistic brilliance is overlooked and mocked. As he struggles with his predicament after losing his purpose, he makes a fatal error. But in the end we see it was really the people who looked down on him who made the error by misjudging what Roman had to offer.\n\nIn the most subtle way, the film also asks us to review how we&apos;ve treated people who seem strange to us and who we have mocked for thinking or sounding different then what we believe people should sound like.\n\nA profound character study that studies not only him impact but those who impact him.\n\nI tried to edit my initial review but didn&apos;t see any way to do that since it wasn&apos;t published yet.",

It&apos;s about a Man(Kevin Kline) and his struggle in life with his job, family, and health. Through the move he gets in touch with his troubled son Sam(Hayden Christensen) and ex-wife Robin(Kristin Scott Thomas) a lot of anger in the beginning of the movie that transforms into smiles and laughter, it&apos;s amazing to see how the characters change so much. If you like to laugh and cry and all that good stuff you&apos;ll love this movie, Watch it, NOW! Although it truly is an excellent movie, I would not recommend this movie to anyone younger than 13, a lot of cursing, some drug usage and sexuality.",

You will know why after seeing it.\n\nPeople are disappointed because they wanted to see an Eddy Murphy style comedy, the problem is this ain&apos;t a comedy it is a drama with a very good message. I loved Eddy Murphy in his first movies, he was a fast talking joke machine, he still is but the jokes are the same and comedy has moved on. For that matter I didn&apos;t like the comedy portion of this movie too much but I was deeply touched by the drama version. The solution to his problem is right in front of him and anyone who is willing to give this movie a fair chance will see it too and exactly this is what made the movie so strong because he is doing it all wrong and you want to scream at the screen and tell him what to do and how to do it.\n\nIn my opinion Eddy Murphy gave a partially brilliant performance. As I said I didn&apos;t enjoy the comedy too much, it was some sort of best of Eddy Murphy but when you are willing to accept that this is actually a drama and understand the comedy part as the metaphor that it is you will love this movie and maybe pull something valuable out of the message. For the concept of the message Eddy Murphy was the best possible actor for this role.",

      "reviewBody": "Chucky was always my favorite of the many serial killers that sprouted from the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s slasher films. Sure, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, Pinhead, Leatherface and Freddy Krueger were all instrumental in my fascination and divulgence into the horror genre - but the possessed Good Guys doll by the name of Chucky was always my favorite of the tentpole franchises.\n\nIt is hard to fathom that it was 25 years ago when Chucky was first launched into our pop culture references with Child&apos;s Play. Directed to Tom Holland on a story by Don Mancini, the 1988 horror surprised most everyone with a $35 million box office gross against a paltry $9 million budget.\n\nSequels ensued with Child&apos;s Play 2 (1990), Child&apos;s Play 3 (1991), Bride of Chucky (1998) and Seed of Chucky (2004). Through each film, the horror seemed lessened by the increasing use of black humor scattered amongst the bloodshed.\n\nThis is not to suggest that the Child&apos;s Play franchise lost its way, but it did veer off the original path. This deviation was not lost of creator Don Mancini who takes charge behind the camera for Curse of Chucky now available on VOD.\n\nIn this sixth edition of the evil doll&apos;s murderous exploits, Chucky is shipped from a police evidence lockup to a home of a young woman, Nica, confined to a wheelchair since birth. Chucky&apos;s first victim alienates the young woman and when other family and friends arrive at the house to comfort Nica, it allows for a higher body count and a night of mayhem. Nica is able to put the pieces together to eventually figure the doll at the centre of the bloodshed, but her limited mobility will be both a benefit and a hindrance on her ultimate survival.\n\nWe&apos;ve come a long way since 1988 and Mancini has more digital tricks up his sleeve to bring the doll to life. Some might balk at the idea of a CGI motioned doll, but take our word for it, the added computer detail only adds to Chucky&apos;s evil looks. There are a few scenes where our villain gets to show real emotion using his rubber face and it is the technology that a lot of horror enthusiasts despise that is at the root of the improvements.\n\nMancini did go back to the roots with the story that focuses more on the development of the horror rather than the slapstick funduggery that overly consumed Bride and Seed of Chucky. Replacing much of the pop culture referencing in-jokes are some tense moments of horror and some valued kills that value quality over quantity.\n\nCurse of Chucky goes places unexpected for a fifth sequel and it betters any of the films that preceded it in the series. Chucky is meaner, nastier and more patient which allows for better horror. There are some good scares in Curse and Chucky&apos;s evil might never have been better punctuated on screen. A solid story – one with flashback ties that support Chucky&apos;s choice of family terrorizing and some after the credit scenes that tie in the rest of the series – compliments the action and sets the stage for what we hope is the continuation of the franchise.\n\nwww.killerreviews.com",

      "reviewBody": "Congrats to HBO for having the guts to produce a script which mainstream studios refused to consider. &quot;Behind The Candelabra&quot; gives us a story about Liberace&apos;s personal life, from the POV of his one time lover, &quot;blond Adonis&quot; Scott Thorson. The plot spans some ten years, from 1977 to Liberace&apos;s death in 1987.\n\nAside from his public persona, Liberace (Michael Douglas) comes across as egotistical, daring, self-absorbed, and to some extent old-fashioned in his values and beliefs. Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) comes across as passive, a tad lazy, and lacking in foresight and intellect. The plot&apos;s first half presents us with a love story. In the second half, reality sets in. One gets the feeling that though there may have been love between the two, Scott is just one more object for Liberace to collect, which was easy for him given his wealth. That kind of material relationship speaks poorly of both men.\n\nThis film has a big cast, and some well-known names. Rob Lowe is terrific as a humorously bizarre plastic surgeon. Debbie Reynolds, as Lee&apos;s elderly mother, is so good that she is unrecognizable. Nearly all of the actors give fine performances. Michael Douglas especially deserves credit given that Liberace&apos;s mannerisms and image are so well known.\n\nLavish custom costumes, detailed and elaborate production design, tons of subtle and not-so-subtle makeup all combine to add enormously to the story&apos;s credibility, as does the cinematography. Interior lighting makes Liberace&apos;s on-stage performances come alive. Music is, not unexpectedly, what Liberace liked, to some extent stuffy and old-fashioned.\n\nI was never a Liberace fan. But he was a much-beloved entertainer and talented pianist, who had a long show business career. That the Hollywood studios turned this script down tells us a great deal about Hollywood. The real hero in this film is not a character so much as it is HBO. Maybe there is hope that quality films can still be made, despite cowardly industry insiders.",

It has a kind of classic, low budget sense about it. I liked the premise of this film, an amnesiac in a psychiatric institution is being terrorized by a ghost that is stalking and killing the other patients, it is definitely watchable from the start to end. But on a whole this film is well directed by Carpenter. Someone else mentioned the soundtrack which plays in the opening credits, it has a haunting child-like voice. it did have another song also Run Baby Run - The Newbeats. I have seen all of Carpenters films and this was pretty good, it has a more dignified sense about it than some of his others.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a good thing that director Walter Hill has waited 8 years before making a sequel of the original &quot;48 hrs.&quot;  If he had released this film immediately after the first one, it would have become a flop.  The reason is because both films are very much alike.  &quot;Another 48 hrs.&quot; hasn&apos;t got anything new to offer; it&apos;s an almost exact copy of the first one.  And that&apos;s precisely why they waited so long before making this sequel.\n\nNothing really changed actually.  There&apos;s Nick Nolte who plays the same cigarette-smoking and alcohol-addicted tough-guy cop forced to team together with Eddy Murphy who takes up his part as the noisy, bad-mouth and know-it-all convict-character again.  Just like in the first film, it&apos;s the chemistry between these two actors that makes &quot;Another 48 hrs.&quot; really worth-watching.  And just like in the first film, the only decent acting comes from Nick Nolte and Eddy Murphy while the rest of the cast is merely below average. Once more the action scenes are great to watch.  This is a good thing, because it makes you forget about the weak script.  The dialogues are funny, but they&apos;re overloaded again with harsh language.  Some might find this annoying; I honestly thought it became funny after a while.\n\nThe ending is pretty weak and predictable, but on the whole &quot;Another 48 hrs.&quot; is almost as good as its predecessor and good waste of time; not money."

      "reviewBody": "Before this film was released in 1998, it was, originally, a play. This play was performed on stage in 1993 and had a huge success. Francis Weber felt like adapting his play (he was the author) for the screen and he had a good idea. The action takes place in a beautiful Parisian flat. Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte) lives there and each week, he and his friends take part in a special dinner: a &quot;dîner de cons&quot;. They&apos;ve got to invite someone silly and the one who has found the best dumb is the winner of the evening. Brochant has chosen François Pignon (Jacques Villeret) and before going to the dinner, Brochant has invited him in his flat. Then, in a few minutes, everything&apos;s wrong: his wife&apos;s leaving him, he&apos;s got a backache, he&apos;s got to face his mistress etc.... and Pignon is a bit responsible for this! There are two main types of comic in this film: on one hand the comic comes from the dialogues which are very funny with a lot of successful puns. Moreover they&apos;re never vulgar. On the other hand, the comic comes from the situation where Brochant is: not only has he got to face Pignon but he&apos;s got to face unexpected events like the arrival of a fiscal inspector (Daniel Prévost). Above all, the film is worth watching for its incredible main actors: Lhermitte who is the perfect hypocrite and Villeret who is full of goodwill and kindness in spite of its idiocy and its naivety (in 1999, he won the Oscar for the best actor in France and he deserved it). Moreover, the other actors are very well used, especially Francis Huster and Daniel Prévost who are both excellent. The only weaknesses of this film are the moment where Prévost comes in Brochant&apos;s flat and then the plot is resolved very laboriously. The other moment is when Pignon is calling Mrs Brochant to tell her his real thoughts about her husband: you&apos;ve got a quite conventional dialogue. Nevertheless, if you want to have a good time, watch this comedy it&apos;s worth watching!",

Depp is forced to kill a senator or his daughter will be killed by Walken and Maffia.  He is given a gun and a time limit to carry it out.\n\nAs the basis for a thriller it doesn&apos;t quite work - the real time concept falls apart a few times, but with this much talent on board it still holds it own.  A throwback to the Hitchcock everyman thrillers of years ago, Depp plays his character well and you always believe he is just an ordinary man in an unbelievable situation rather than an action hero in the making while Walken does what he does best and plays the villain well.\n\nThe plot holds together well and you really find stuff out at the same time as Depp does.  Some of the conspiracy stuff towards the end of the film is obvious and doesn&apos;t add anything to the film, but the main story revolving around Depp and Walken is tense enough to carry the film.\n\nIt doesn&apos;t contain any explosions or martial arts but the tension is good throughout.  It&apos;s not a classic thriller but it&apos;s quite an original idea and plot and almost manages to keep the tension for the whole movie."

Living with her parents and wanting to make things better for herself and her children, she takes a job at a thriving Minnesota iron mine where only a handful of women work under constant oppression and harassment from their lascivious male co-workers. Despite her degrading reputation, the possible consequences, and a working staff that seems unwilling to help, she files a lawsuit determined to reclaim her dignity and bridge the gender gap. Although well-crafted, acted, and based on true events, this oddly never convinces; the plotting and characters are set up far too easily, and the intended dramatic climax doesn&apos;t pack any punch. Theron is quite good, so is Jenkins as her stern, conflicted dad, surrounded by a capable cast, but the story fails to rise above the level of convention. **½"

      "reviewBody": "Crime lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is released from prison, and on his long drive back to New York City, witnesses the filth his city has descended into since his incarceration. His old friend Jimmy Jump (Laurence Fishburne) has just wiped out a Colombian drug operation and welcomes Frank back with a suitcase full of money and cocaine. Eager to win his city back, and also help fund the saving of an inner city hospital through his drug operation, he sets the wheels to his crowning in motion. But cops Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), Gilley (David Caruso) and Flanigan (Wesley Snipes) are on his case, but after struggling to bring Frank in under regulations, resort to more illegal methods of getting him off the streets.\n\nKing of New York was booed upon its initial screenings, with mass walk- outs and cult director Abel Ferrara being bombarded with uncomfortable questions. Audiences were apparently appalled by the films seemingly glamorous depiction of man who was essentially a homicidal maniac, encouraging violence and sleaze wherever he went. The film is certainly guilty of that, but the character of Frank is a little different to the likes of Tony Montana or Henry Hill. He seems to style himself as a champion of the lower-classes, using his influence and vast wealth to push a councilman to put forth the money to save a hospital in a poverty-stricken area, and then fund it himself when that fails. He and his girlfriend Jennifer (Janet Julian) are robbed on the subway by inner-city youths. Frank shown them his gun, and they back off, but Frank throws them a wad of money and tells them there is work for them if they want it. A crime-lord he may be, but is he any worse than the fat politicians that soak up the city&apos;s money, or the bent cops that are on his back?\n\nIn Walken&apos;s hands, White is a charismatic, unconventional crime boss, and is in turns charming, strange, and deranged. It&apos;s a fabulous performance, but for me it was Laurence (here still credited as Larry) Fishburne that steals the show, as the swaggering, loud-mouthed gun-man Jimmy (&quot;yo, where the chicken at?&quot; he says after killing a cop), a man of such ridiculous posturing that he almost becomes a cartoon character. And this is one of the main reasons I loved this film. It is, at times, so outlandishly over-the-top that it should betray its gritty roots, but its so steeped in atmosphere and that key element, grime, that it becomes a fantasy-laden, insane ride amongst a decaying city and one its most colourful characters.\n\nFor anyone who has seen the work of Abel Ferrara, especially two of his most popular films, The Driller Killer (1979) and Bad Lieutenant (1992), will know what they are in for. His New York is not the one you see in the earlier works of Woody Allen, but one of whacked-out prostitutes, cocaine-sniffing criminals, inner-city poverty, and angry, sweaty, middle-aged detectives. We do glimpse the glitzier side of the city in King of New York, as Frank often mingles with the politicians and power- players, but it is a world of black suits and orange lighting, and a world that shares the same depravity and sleaze as the lower-classes. It&apos;s a grim thing to see through Abel Ferrara&apos;s gaze, but boy is it brimming with atmosphere. This will always play second or third fiddle to the likes of Scarface (1983), but King of New York is the film the former could never be, and in its own depressing way, is a much better film. Undoubtedly Ferrara&apos;s finest, and most &apos;polished&apos; work.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago, and I was not disappointed.  I won&apos;t bother summarizing the story since everyone else has, but I will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout.  The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable.\n\nMy only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely lacking; the movie wrapped up very abruptly- in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half, as though the writers weren&apos;t sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot wasn&apos;t nearly as important as the music and the action, this didn&apos;t really affect the entertainment value of the film, so this is not as major a complaint as it would seem.\n\n(2) This is really nitpicky, but the music that the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated after 1985, when the movie was set. INXS&apos; Devil Inside was from 1987 and AC/DC&apos;s Are You Ready was from 1990, among other mistakes.  This bothers me a bit, since they obviously went to lengths to make a good period piece, they could have checked the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier.  Again, not a big deal.\n\nOh, I thought of something else that was strange.  The Steel Dragon band members were supposed to be English, but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy guitarist Zakk Wylde played band members, and they each had a couple of speaking lines in AMERICAN accents.  That was kind of lazy also, but it was still cool to see actual musicians playing musicians, so I will forgive that as well.\n\nI could probably nitpick all day, but I don&apos;t want to give the impression that this wasn&apos;t a super entertaining movie.  I will probably buy the DVD when it comes out, and I will certainly buy the soundtrack CD simply for the six Steel Dragon songs (some of which were sung by the singer from the band Steelheart, if you remember them!).  The highlight of the film was possibly a great outtake where Mark Wahlberg is lipsynching to a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.  The surprised look of Mark&apos;s face is priceless.  Classic rock and roll flick! Score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment",

      "name": "A Tom Six out of a ten-person centipede (Get it?)",
      "reviewBody": "You might be taken aback by my comedic summary regarding my vote to &quot;The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)&quot;. I guess it&apos;s my way of dealing with this horrifying and utterly bleak film, which must be at least partly related to why black comedy exists; people need to amuse themselves and others to cope when it comes to something like this film. It could easily be why the first one is parodied on &quot;South Park&quot; in the enjoyable episode &quot;HUMANCENTiPAD&quot;. In the New York Times interview &quot;A More Perfect Union&quot;, writer and director Tom Six himself indicated this film has humour, like maybe when there&apos;s thunder and lightning when Martin, the main character, gives an angry facial expression to someone. I admit I kind of laughed at that, but I don&apos;t think I laughed at anything else. However, I did say things out loud a few times, like probably &quot;Oh God&quot; in a dismaying manner. More appropriate, I think.\n\nMartin is a demented, obese, and non-speaking man, played very well by newcomer Laurence R. Harvey. Martin works as a security guard in an underground parking garage and has a sexual obsession with the first film. Yup, the first film, which Tom Six also wrote and directed. However, whereas that one has three people sewn together ass to mouth, Martin sets out to have *twelve* for his human centipede. Why? For his own entertainment and sexual pleasure. Talk about an unusual sequel. He violently kidnaps some people in the parking garage. There&apos;s not a single bystander around, for whatever reason. I&apos;m not sure if I buy that, but then again, I don&apos;t know how much realism Tom Six was going for. Martin keeps his centipede victims in a warehouse and eventually combines ten of them together, which makes my summary even more suitable.\n\n&quot;The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)&quot; is in black and white. If it was in colour, especially with little or even no altering, the film would&apos;ve still been bleak, of course, but as it is, boy, is it bleak. In a good way, nonetheless. It *sort of* reminds me of &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, a David Lynch film I really admire. Both are eerie, weird, in black and white, don&apos;t have much dialogue, involve an infant or two, and have each main character living in an apartment. &quot;Eraserhead&quot; is weirder and definitely not as violent, though. If David Lynch saw this film, I wonder what he would think about it.\n\nIf I look away when watching a film, it&apos;s usually because the film doesn&apos;t have me interested and not because there&apos;s something way too repulsive happening on the screen for me to even look at. With &quot;The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)&quot;, I never looked away, though I almost did because it did get a bit too boring. Nonetheless, it&apos;s mostly effective with its unorthodox storytelling, grungy and downbeat look, and the acting. (I had a bit of trouble believing the couple at the beginning, but that&apos;s a nitpick.)\n\nThere&apos;s a lot of human suffering and it largely comes from the victims in the warehouse. Even though they seriously lack characterization, I did care about them, at least somewhat. No sane person wants to go through their ordeal. I should mention I really enjoyed the first film. Even though the victims also lack characterization, they have more going for them and I strangely felt more sorry and supportive for them. It&apos;s probably because their pain wasn&apos;t overwhelming, they&apos;re main characters, and there&apos;s more focus on them potentially escaping. Here, the story is told mostly from Martin&apos;s perspective. He&apos;s definitely not somebody to root for. Why is he twisted? What&apos;s wrong with his sexuality? His sexual abuse by his father, whom we don&apos;t see in person, probably has something to do with those questions. Probably abuse by his mother, as well, whom he lives with. Yeah, this film hardly explores his past.\n\nHow come we never see Martin talk? I don&apos;t know. I actually don&apos;t consider it a flaw, however. I&apos;m so used to main characters talking in films and with the different way it&apos;s done here, I didn&apos;t mind. He&apos;s implicitly characterized, but at the same time, his behaviour is pretty unsurprising. I don&apos;t think main characters necessarily have to be likable as if they&apos;re a close friend, but they should be interesting, one way or another. It actually seems like we&apos;re suppose to feel sorry for him at times, like when his mother lays blame on him to an angry neighbour over something *she* did. I guess Martin deserves some pity there, but when it comes to the film as a whole, you&apos;d probably be wishing him death or having him locked away in a mental institution. I pick the latter. Maybe it&apos;d be interesting if his past was explored and if he used to normally talk, what his dialogue was like, but as the film is, I&apos;m okay with him *as a character*.\n\nI didn&apos;t like or dislike &quot;The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)&quot;. It&apos;s well shot, even though shots are depressing as hell, especially in black and white. I doubt the film is trying to say anything about someone who&apos;s inspired by violence in films to use violence in real life. I don&apos;t think the film absolutely should, either. In the aforementioned New York Times interview, Tom Six said that such a person is already insane. He&apos;s probably right. In an interesting way, this film ends ambiguously, which I won&apos;t spoil how, but the third and final film that&apos;s in the works will apparently begin with this film&apos;s ending, just like how this one begins with the ending of the first. This trilogy is Mr. Six&apos;s film centipede. What the heck is he gonna do with the last one? Maybe it should be a musical."

      "name": "Van Damme show against the violent Hong Kong mafia and using his incredible fighting skills",
      "reviewBody": "Agreeable thriller with tongue-in-cheek, containing suspense, thrills, noisy action-packed, gun-play, loads of violence and it will appeal the true devotee of main actor. Sheldon directs this film that mixes for umpteenth time: action, a lot of violence and humor in the way that would later characterize the films of the genre from the eighties and especially those starring Van Damme or Arnold Schwarzenegger. This violent film contains thriller, suspense , action , tension and spectacular/well choreographed fights. Jean-Claude displays his usual likable acting and the mayhem is largely wrought by mighty Van Damme, who never delivers one blow or bullet where three will do. Van Damme plays two twins go to a relentless vendetta against Hong Kong mobsters. It begins with businessman Paul Wagner and his wife are brutally murdered in Hong Kong. Their two six-month-old twin children will follow different paths. Little Chad is adopted by a close friend of his parents, Frank Avery (Geoffrey Lewis) . While Alex is left in the care of his nanny, who puts him in an orphanage in Hong Kong. Years later, Chad (Jean-Claude Van Damme) discovers Alex (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is his twin brother he never knew and was given up for adoption. Chad and Alex meet again and decide to look for the murderers of their parents. One packs a punch One packs a Piece together they deliver !. Feel The Impact !. Double Van Damme !. Twin brothers torn apart by violence !. On a mission of revenge !. One packs a punch. One packs a piece. Together they deliver...!. Two brothers separated by the violence. Now together in a mission of revenge. The Other Side of Safety !. The other side of safe !. The nearer he gets to the truth, the closer he gets to the edge !.\n\nFine flick with more than a semblance of an enjoyable and entertaining story without being excessively cerebral, including thrills, spectacular fighting , mayhem and breathtaking chases. Sheldon Lettich is in charge of directing this martial arts film where Van Damme plays Chad and Alex Wagner twins against ruthless Asian mafias. Bulk fights, karate and a lot of action is the general tone of this blockbuster film that follows in the footsteps of Bruce Lee&apos;s cinema. Leading the cast is our endearing Jean-Claude Van Damme as one army man, he did not want to use doubles for the stunts and ended the filming with some wounds and bruises. Van Damme in a deja vu, similar to &apos;Ringo Lam&apos;s Maximum Risk&apos;, plays a double role, two identical twins and they go into action when the bad guys chase them. But this lunkhead kick-em-up doesnt take advantage of that gimmick. Entertaining movie , thanks to tight pace, skillful edition and well mounted combats . It&apos;s tense and exciting , at time glossy enough action movie and the overwhelming struggles are well done. The basic story would have been the same with just one Jean-Claude. Risk, noisy action and danger aside is not all that bad, what with gorgeous Alonna Shaw as his sib&apos;s squeeze benefits much the film. Has all the action you&apos;d expect from a pic with &apos;The Muscles of Brussels&apos; and more fists, guns, and chases is, of course, the major reason to invest your entertainment here.\n\nThe motion picture was average but professionally directed by Sheldon Lettich. Sheldon ensures that fast-paced pursuits and full-throttle combat is well done and visually appealing. He is a craftsman who has written/produced/directed some nice films, most of them starred by Jean-Claude Van Damme as &quot;The Order, Double impact , Hard Corps, and Lionheart&quot; , or performed by other hunk men as Daniel Bernhart : &quot;Perfect Day&quot; , Dolph Lundgren : &quot;List Patrol&quot; , or , Mark Dacascos : &quot;Only the Strong&quot;. Rating 5/10. Mediocre but acceptable action picture. The flick will appeal to Jean Claude Van Damme fans. It&apos;s a must see for Van Damme fans.",

      "reviewBody": "Story :  The story is set in a small town called Chanderi in MP which is supposedly haunted by an angry female spirit which targets only men during four days of an annual religious festival held there. Whether it is actually a spirit or just an urban legend is the mystery element in the film. Bicky (Rajkumar Rao), the protagonist is the best ladies tailor in town, one who can take measurements of ladies by just glancing at them. He and his &quot;velha&quot; friends Bittu (Aparshakti Khurana) and Jana (Abhishek Bannerjee) get involved in this whole mystery when Bicky meets a mysterious girl Shraddha Kapoor who only comes to Chanderi during the four days of the festival. As men start disappearing from Chanderi, it is upto these three friends along with a bumbling param gyaani Rudra (Pankaj Tripathi) to unravel the mystery.\n\nReview:  This is a unique film totally unlike usual horror flicks as it combines multiple genres like comedy, horror &amp; dark humour which is not commonly seen. The blending of comedy in between the horror storyline is perfect and does not look outlandish. It however tones down the impact of the scary scenes. Having said that, the film has its scary moments which are the result of great visual and sound effects. \n\nCasting: The casting is perfect with the three friends along with the bumbling Pankaj Tripathi providing most of the laughs. Shraddha Kapoor provides the mystery element to the storyline as she conveys both innocence and well as a sinister mind at play effectively. Rao and Tripathi are the scene stealers who breeze through their parts with ease.  This is a film from Dinesh Vijan&apos;s Maddock Films, the makers of the zombie flick Go Goa Gone and they genuinely succeed in making a different film by combining multiple genres without diluting the essence or making the film look tacky.\n\nMy Verdict : If you have liked GO Goa Gone , you will definitely like this one. 8 out of 10 from me for this ridiculously genuine attempt by Maddock films at attempting to make something different.",

I should&apos;ve saw one of the others. I don&apos;t even remember what they are now, but it doesn&apos;t matter. I am pretty sure that THE AVENGERS is the worst movie of the decade and one of my least favorite movies of all time.\n\nJohn Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) team up to stop Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) from destroying the planet with a weather-changing machine. I won&apos;t go into the plot too deeply, because it&apos;s just plain stupid.\n\nThe acting in this movie was not very good. Ralph Fiennes and Fiona Shaw (Father) play two of the most annoying characters in any movies that I have ever seen. The constant unwitty one-liners between Fiennes and Thurman is very annoying. Sean Connery is at his worst here. I was disappointed in him, because he is a great actor who doesn&apos;t belong in this movie. Sir August de Wynter? Just the name of the character alone should tell you much.\n\nThere was, however, one thing that was good about this movie. That would be Uma Thurman in her tight leather. I am absolutely in love with Uma Thurman, and I don&apos;t think she belonged in this film, but I am pretty sure seeing her wearing those catsuits were the only thing that kept me from having to eat my own legs and drink my own urine to survive this movie.\n\nMaybe you&apos;ll think I&apos;m exaggerating a bit, but I found this movie to be boring and annoying. I recommend that it be avoided at all costs.",

It never dips into sentimentality or become too serious, and is a quality, well-paced production in general.\n\nHappening to catch this on TV recently, I&apos;d long forgotten that Sly can not only act when he wants to, but has excellent comic timing. (He really should have not spent so much time trying to be an action hero, but explored his dramatic and comic abilities). There are some really good moments, such as when his mom squares up to a sly villain threatening her son and comes out with a catchphrase of Sly&apos;s real-life rival Arnie Schwartzenegger.\n\nThe only criticism I&apos;d give is that toward the end a slightly laborious car chase is thrown in, but thankfully the comedy returns as his interfering mom steps in again. Good entertainment, and it really, really deserves at least a couple of stars more on the IMDb rating.",

      "reviewBody": "As TV&apos;s &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; reaches 20 million households a week in the US in the early 1950s, it&apos;s star, Lucille Ball, is fighting Communist affiliation rumors started by columnist Walter Winchell; she&apos;s also fighting with husband and co-star Desi Arnaz about his lack of marital attention and is about to reveal to the television audience that both she and her TV-counterpart, Lucy Ricardo, are &quot;expecting&quot;. Although this handsomely-produced portrait of the legendary actress is an entertaining one, there are a myriad of timeline issues and anachronisms within the film which &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; purists are bound to be troubled by. There&apos;s also a hurdle in buying Javier Bardem as Desi Arnaz (Bardem has Desi&apos;s Cuban-accented voice--and his flirtatious charms--down, but he&apos;s too old for the role). Kidman fares better as Lucy, proving her naysayers wrong and giving a wry, tough, courageous performance. Lucy&apos;s off-camera relationship with Vivian Vance (played by Nina Arianda) is curiously edgy despite reports throughout the years these two were the best of friends; meanwhile, codger William Frawley (J. K. Simmons) is shown to be irascible yet cogent and sharp in place of the heavy drinker Arnaz went out on a limb to have cast. I didn&apos;t care for the documentary-like framing device of the show&apos;s creators discussing the series in the present day (there&apos;s enough flashbacks and flash-forwards happening here); however, when writer-director Aaron Sorkin gets down to business, he delivers some terrifically tasty behind-the-scenes action. **1/2 from ****",

I was not asked by anyone for a character of me to be played by an actor. To be honest I wish they didn&apos;t make this movie, the actions that day where for us only, not for the world to see in a Hollywood movie. As for the movie itself it was somewhat realistic of the events but once again it&apos;s made by Hollywood and made to look heroic when it wasn&apos;t, we almost lost the COP that day as well as our lives. 90% of the time the boredom was unbearable. Not sure what else to say, some movies don&apos;t need to be made and just left alone.",

      "reviewBody": "I was surprised at how good this movie is. A remake of a movie starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, directed by one of the greats of American cinema, Billy Wilder, is not exactly the kind of task for the faint of heart. The fact that Sydney Pollack (They Shoot Horses Don&apos;t They? (1969), Tootsie (1982), Out of Africa (1985), etc.) decided to do it must have raised a few eyebrows in Hollywood land.\n\nAnd let&apos;s just say I had preconceptions as I sat down to watch this. No way could this be anything near as good as the original. And for the first twenty minutes or so I was not dissuaded. Julia Ormond, who was given Miss Hepburn&apos;s title role, seemed nothing far removed from ordinary; and Greg Kinnear, who played the playboy David Larrabee, seemed a poor imitation of William Holden. Of course Harrison Ford, I told myself, is another story, since he is the embodiment of the fulfillment of the desire of many woman, and a fine, accomplished leading man. He would be, I suspected, the lone bright spot. In the original, Humphrey Bogart, a little past his prime, and in not exactly the best of moods, and not entirely pleased with the relatively inexperienced Audrey Hepburn, played the cool tycoon Linus Larrabee with some distracted forbearance in what many consider one of his lesser performances. Surely Harrison Ford could improve on that.\n\nHe did, but what really surprised me was just how diabolically clever the oh, so romantic script by Barbara Benedek and David Rayfiel turned out to be. I mean, Cinderella move over. Sabrina could not have achieved a more glorious existence had she died and gone to heaven. It is hard to imagine a more fulfilling fantasy for a chauffeur&apos;s daughter than what transpires here.\n\nQuickly here&apos;s the premise of this celluloid fairy tale/romance: Pretty but ordinary Sabrina, born of working class parents, her father the chauffeur of the ultra rich Larrabees, grows up living above the garage in the palatial Larrabee estate. She watches the lavish parties thrown by the Larrabees from a spot in a tree and falls madly in the kind of puppy love that never goes away with the younger of the Larrabee brothers, David, who is the kind of guy who gives playboys a bad name. When she comes of age, she goes away to Paris (apparently to work for a fashion magazine: in the original Sabrina, she goes to a cooking school in Paris), picks up confidence and a new kind of eye-popping sophistication, comes back and...well, gets noticed.\n\nThe basic skeleton of this, the story from the first Sabrina (1954), which is dreamily romantic enough and then some, is greatly augmented here with some very fine psychological touches including developing Sabrina&apos;s character beyond the pretty and stylish to something bordering on the wise and heroic. Suffice it to say that we come away feeling she deserves every rainbow&apos;s end she gets. I can see Benedek and Rayfiel exclaiming with riotous joy as they are writing the script (trading e-mails perhaps): &quot;They want romance, they want woman&apos;s fantasy? They want Sabrina to have a pot of gold and true love everlasting? How about riches beyond counting and the doting attention of the two handsome, very rich brothers? She can take her pick. We&apos;ve give &apos;em romance, we&apos;ll give &apos;em dreams come true!&quot; And they do. Not only that, but they keep us guessing about who gets the girl until the last possible moment, and they do that very cleverly.\n\nOf course it helps to have professional direction by Sydney Pollack and a fine cast including Harrison Ford--at his best, by the way--and Julia Ormond, a hard-working and talented actress (I recall her from Smilla&apos;s Sense of Snow, 1997), who knows how to be cute without fawning, supported by Greg Kinnear, Nancy Marchand, John Wood and Angie Dickinson. I mention Miss Dickinson because, as the mother of a perspective bride about to throw an incredibly lavish wedding, she gets to deliver this &quot;let them eat cake&quot; line: &quot;We thought we&apos;d use recycled paper&quot; (for the wedding invitations).\n\nThe script is full of similar witticisms, some verbal, some like eye candy. For example, when Sabrina removes her glasses (the usual Hollywood signal for the adolescent ugly duckling to become a beautiful swan) after gaining sophistication in Paris, she quotes aptly but surprisingly from Gertrude Stein: &quot;America is my country and Paris is my home.&quot; (Of course Gertrude Stein never heard of Paris, Texas--but that is another film, and besides, I digress...)\n\nI also liked it when Sabrina is in the arms of her Paris would-be lover who kisses her, and--noticing that she is not as engaged as she might me–observes with perfect decorum, &quot;I&apos;m embarrassed that you&apos;re somewhere else.&quot;\n\nMemorable was the shot of Harrison Ford momentarily looking jealous and hurt. By the way, he has a number of good lines, and he delivers them well.\n\nI especially liked it when he sadly confessed: &quot;I was sent to deal with you. I sent myself.&quot; \n\nIt is probably better if you haven&apos;t seen the original and can experience this on its own merits without the odiousness that sometimes comes with comparisons. Comparing Audrey Hepburn with Julia Ormond is like comparing Grace Kelly with Jennifer Lopez. They really are very different people. And comparing Billy Wilder&apos;s 1954 film (from the play by Samuel Taylor) is a little like comparing Lon Chaney&apos;s Phantom of the Opera with Andrew Lloyd Webber&apos;s.\n\nBottom line: see this for both Harrison Ford who wears the business-first character of the &quot;only surviving heart donor&quot; very well, and for Julia Ormond whose intense and beguiling performance makes us forgive her for not being Audrey Hepburn.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon!)",

Dazzling to watch, with Givenchy-inspired costumes (if Daniel Orlandi does not receive an Oscar for his work, his peers should turn in their Designer cards), wonderfully over-the-top sets (EVERYBODY in those 60s films lived in apartments you could land airplanes in), and a &apos;More 1963 New York than 1963 New York&apos; look (created on the studio back lot, with ample support from CGI), the film would deserve a viewing even if the cast never uttered a line of dialog!\n\nFortunately, the script, by Eve Ahlert and Dennis Drake, is wickedly funny, full of the politically incorrect double entendres that were as close as Hollywood could get to actual &apos;naughtiness&apos;, 30 years ago (and, yes, there are more than a few present that WOULD have been censored, even then). The story, of a woman who writes a best-selling &apos;self-help&apos; book eschewing the necessity of men for any more than &apos;casual sex&apos;, and the &apos;Hugh Hefner&apos;-like writer who turns his prodigious charms to work, in the guise of a naive astronaut, to win her love, and thus discredit her theories, would have fit Doris Day and Rock Hudson to a &apos;T&apos;. While Renée Zellweger and Ewan McGregor lack their role models&apos; charisma, they have a pleasant chemistry together, and the &apos;split-screen&apos; phone call scenes between the pair are even racier than the Day/Hudson 60s versions.\n\nIf the leads seem a bit bland, the supporting cast more than makes up for any shortcomings. In a role that SHOULD garner a &apos;Supporting Actor&apos; Oscar nomination, David Hyde Pierce takes on the part assumed by Tony Randall or Gig Young in those 60s farces, that of the put-upon, neurotic, sometimes prissy friend of the hero. He is superb, even SOUNDING like Tony Randall, and steals every scene he&apos;s in. His &apos;opposite number&apos;, friend of the heroine Sarah Paulson, while not quite at Pierce&apos;s level, is still quite funny as a chain-smoking career woman who would chuck it all for the right man. And, in a FABULOUS piece of casting, the MAN himself, Tony Randall, appears as the book publisher whose bestseller is RUINING his love life. At 83, the man can still toss off a funny line...\n\nWith a very inventive &apos;twist-within-a-twist&apos; climax, and Marc Shaiman&apos;s evocative score punctuating the proceedings, DOWN WITH LOVE is a delight!"

How can you not sniggle, laugh, guffaw and even cheer for a love-handled, smoking, suger-eating, beer-drinking, bull-charging, bar-dancing Archangel who sloops cereal and pie with his whole left-hand wrapped around a spoon-handle while outfitted in Vinnie Barbarino&apos;s middle-aged body with wings? It&apos;s one of the most ludicrous, classic, side-splitting images available on the silver screen. And if you don&apos;t &apos;get&apos; that image, here&apos;s a quarter --- go buy yourself a life.\n\nI found the supporting cast, well -- well-cast. Hurt, MacDowell, Pastorelli, Hoskins, Stapleton et al played the characters they were given to a &apos;T.&quot; And despite Travolta stealing the show, those characters are quintessential to the storyline  you&apos;ll see. Though this is a simple feel-good story (nothing complicated to follow, just out of the ordinary) with laughs, sniffles and a touch of heart, you can&apos;t get out of this without some introspection into your own life. Maybe that&apos;s why the IMDb nay-sayers of this film have such a problem with it (you poor, sad people).\n\nPlease  do yourself a favor, ignore the &apos;lifeless&apos; and treat yourself to something GOOD. Lord knows, we can&apos;t get enough of that"

Music is simply Soulful, #LoveYouZindagi and #AeZindagiGaleLagaLe is already HIT Among the Youth. Cinematography is Eye Catching. Watertight Story &amp; Screenplay. There is no dull moment throughout the flick. Fast Paced First &amp; Second Half. That&apos;s the finest part of the film. Classy Production Designing, Editing is Sharp &amp; Crispy. Climax is simply Outstanding. Dialogues are well written &amp; wonderful at many places.  Shah Rukh Khan is a breath of fresh air. Right from the first scene to his final scene. His and Alia Bhatt&apos;s chemistry was brilliant.  Story was very thought provoking.It changes the way you look at your life at your destiny.Story is pure work of class and hard work put in by Gauri Shinde. &quot;Don&apos;t let your past blackmail your present to ruin your beautiful future. SHAH RUKH&apos;s charm took the movie to a different level. This movie is not a genre of all the audiences but for the ones who love classy Movies not massy ones.\n\nPros: Shah Rukh back at his best. Great and flawless story. Cinematography is brilliant All the hard work put in by whole team\n\nCons:None that I can find, only thing is the editing could have been more better and the music could have been more good.\n\nAt the end I strongly recommend it to everyone to go and watch this movie. Its one in a million type of movie.Don&apos;t miss it. So I Rate it 8 out of 10 stars but this film is a classic.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Radio&apos; tells the true life story of a high school football coach who befriends a severely mentally retarded young man (whom they nickname &apos;Radio&apos; because he loves listening to the radio so much), lets him hang out with the team, and, thereby, changes not only the boy&apos;s life but the lives of just about everyone in the South Carolina town in which they live. When Radio&apos;s behavior on the sidelines begins to serve as a distraction during the games, some of the less sympathetic, die-hard football fans of the town make an effort to downplay his role or eliminate his presence altogether.\n\nSet in 1976, &apos;Radio&apos; is a thoroughly predictable, sentimental heart tugger that will have people either gagging on the syrup or crying in their popcorn. For all its heavy handed manipulation, however, &apos;Radio&apos; turns out to be a pretty decent little film due, primarily, to the superb performances by Ed Harris and Cube Gooding Jr., and to the fact that the movie doesn&apos;t overplay its hand as often as it might. In fact, it wisely underplays much of the conflict, allowing the moments of quiet subtlety to predominate. As played by Harris, Coach Jones is a solid, decent, caring man who can&apos;t help but give his love to a fellow human being who needs it. Harris&apos; soft-spoken strength makes us believe in the goodness of the man. The film does an effective job conveying the incredulous reactions of many of the otherwise well-meaning town folk, as even Radio&apos;s own mother asks Joe why he is doing what he&apos;s doing. The scenes between Jones and this woman, lovingly played by S. Epatha Merkerson, are some of the finest in the film. The movie also isn&apos;t afraid to confront the issue of whether the people of the town - and that includes Jones himself - aren&apos;t actually being patronizing towards Radio in their treatment of him, and whether he isn&apos;t more of a &apos;mascot&apos; for the team than a bona fide member. Gooding Jr. slips effortlessly into the role of Radio, making him a compelling figure even though he has virtually no lines of dialogue in the movie. Alfre Woodard is excellent as the caring but nervous school principal who sees Radio&apos;s presence on campus as a potential threat to student safety, but who has enough faith in Jones to give Radio a chance to prove himself. It&apos;s nice to see Debra Winger in a movie again, although her role as Jones&apos; ever-patient, ever-supportive wife, doesn&apos;t give her much room to strut her stuff as an actress. \n\nThere&apos;s no denying that &apos;Radio&apos; is a humanity-of-man type film that could easily set the teeth on edge with its Goody Two Shoes philosophy of life. Be that as it may, &apos;Radio&apos; turns out to be a warm, uplifting film that even Scrooge would probably like."

It was cool to see him do something out of Type.\n\nIt was weird laughing at people with such messed up lives but some say this is the secret to great comedy, that it comes from a dark place.

The film was directed by the talented Paul Schrader and stars Oscar Issac as the gambler. It also features Willem Dafoe in a cameo. The Dafoe character is very shallow, and we have no idea about how he became the person he was. However, the character exploration of William is much better. Two other characters are also featured; Tiffany Hadish as La Linda, the romantic interest for William, and. Tye Sheridan as Cirk (as in jerk). Too much Abu Gharib torture crap and not enough pyscho-poker. At times, vaguely reminiscent of Taxi Driver due to the driven personalities of the similar protagonists, but Taxi Driver far more effective. A decent take on the miserable, lonely, depressing, and meaningless existence of gamblers, and how casinos are not exciting and fun places to be; they are quite the opposite. Family is far more important.",

      "reviewBody": "Most of the comments here compare EdTV -- flatteringly or unflatteringly -- to The Truman Show.  This is a totally invalid comparison in my opinion, unless you intend to compare opposites.  EdTV is almost the opposite of The Truman Show.  Where The Truman Show was about TV as the ultimate deception (a man is totally shielded from the real world, and his fictionalized life is exposed without his knowledge for the amusement of the masses), EdTV is about TV as the ultimate truth-teller (a man is totally revealed to the real world, and his real life is exposed with his full knowledge for the amusement of the masses).  Perhaps they&apos;re flip sides of the same coin, but they are definitely flip sides...calling it any kind of imitation of The Truman Show misses the point of the film.  Its the antithesis of The Truman Show.\n\nAs to quality, it is generally solid if not spectacular.  There is a bit of a TV-ish quality to it...it would work just as well as a made-for-TV movie as on the big screen.  It also suffers a little from some unbelievable moments showing how Ed can&apos;t have a private conversation with anyone without a camera six inches from his face.  It&apos;s done for effect, but there&apos;s no reason the cameras couldn&apos;t have gotten the exact same picture from further away by simply zooming in.  The performances are all pretty good.  I especially liked Jenna Elfman as Ed&apos;s suddenly overexposed girlfriend.  The screenplay is witty in places, if unremarkable.\n\nAll in all, a worthwhile look at an extreme example of the voyeuristic nature of modern entertainment.  A good rental.  I give it 7 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Jason is stuck at the bottom of Crystal Lake after the events of the last movie. Luckily for him there&apos;s a telekinetic girl (Lar Park-Lincoln) who cries a lot and has Carrie fits. She inadvertently frees Jason, thinking he&apos;s her dead father! Jason immediately starts killing people, naturally. The series was clearly trying to move in a new direction here with more of a focus on the paranormal and supernatural. Terry Kiser from Weekend at Bernie&apos;s plays a shrink in this. He&apos;s better with comedy. Lar Park-Lincoln&apos;s performance consists of crying or being on the verge of crying at all times. My sister used to love this entry in the series because of the angle with the telekinetic girl and the handsome guy who looks like he belongs at a Superman audition.\n\nFirst movie in the series where Kane Hodder plays Jason. He would be the longest-running Jason, playing him for the rest of the series. Frankly, I&apos;m not a big fan of Hodder&apos;s Jason. He&apos;s too big and bulky, like a football player or pro wrestler. Plus they put him in some kind of suit where you are supposed to be able to see his exposed spine and ribcage. It&apos;s incredibly cheesy and just makes Jason cartoonish instead of intimidating.\n\nMost of the people Jason kills in this one aren&apos;t particularly annoying or bad. The first couple seemed quite nice, actually. The whole vibe to this sequel seems off but it&apos;s still a watchable movie. Not the best of the series but far from the worst. There would only be one more decent one after this then it was downhill.",

This is not the first movie that approached a ridiculous subject in such silly manner. Odds are if you hate movies that have done that in the past (ie: Dude, Where&apos;s My Car, Blades of Glory, Hot Rod, etc.) you are gonna hate this one as well. As it stands right now this movie has a 4.6 and that probably a little low due to people 1 staring it because they wanted the Saving Private Ryan of ping pong movies. This movie should probably get a rating in the 6.1-6.3 category. If you have a little time to kill, have already seen Super Bad, and want a good laugh go check it out. Otherwise wait till it comes out on DVD or just ignore it. As for those who have blasted it. Go blast a movie that actually supposed to be good and isn&apos;t as opposed to picking on the 90 lb. asthmatic kid of movies. This movie can&apos;t defend itself for being stupid because is supposed to be. If you couldn&apos;t tell that from the trailer, then odds are you haven&apos;t made it this far into my comment.",

      "reviewBody": "The most amusing humor is the one that reflects reality. Jack&apos;s interactions with the school staff and other parents, and their exaggeratedly militant &quot;faux sensitive&quot; responses, are difficult to watch because they mirror real-life situations. Each of them hides behind a shield of political correctness, using it as a weapon, which contradicts their claimed &quot;sensitivity.&quot; Jack confronts them, stating at one point, &quot;All you care about is not getting in trouble.&quot; The obnoxious 20-something who takes over their company embodies the tiresome, lazy, and arrogant boss we all fear - he has never worked hard, relying on his sense of being &quot;special&quot; to mistreat others. Unfortunately, Jack&apos;s &quot;epiphany&quot; about two-thirds of the way through spoils the entire story. His wife shuts him out, citing his &quot;anger&quot; issues. But he doesn&apos;t have anger issues. He doesn&apos;t physically harm anyone, damage property, unjustly dismiss people from their jobs, avoid work while others labor, or torment his peers or colleagues with a superior attitude. Occasionally, he may call people names and raise his voice. That&apos;s about it. Otherwise, he is the most honest, hard-working, and fair person in the entire narrative. It&apos;s disheartening that the movie takes a downturn by depicting his &quot;transformation&quot; into a diluted, weak version of himself. This is a TERRIBLE outcome, yet the film portrays it as if he has achieved some kind of successful peak.",

      "reviewBody": "A little more music and embellishing of several plot points that were passed over in the original film are what distinguishes this musical version of The Producers. It&apos;s a musical version about a film that had a plot about two men who try to create the biggest flop in the history of Broadway and a musical.\n\nTaking the places of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder as the producing partners Bialystock&amp;Bloom are Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. Both these guys are given an impossible task of repeating two classically congruent performances that Mostel and Wilder created. Even the additional bits of business just can&apos;t make me forget the original. \n\nWill Ferrall did not come over from Broadway to do the role of the hermit like Nazi living in Greenwich Village and caring for his carrier pigeons. He had to do double duty because he also took the place of beatnik method actor Dick Shawn from the original. I&apos;m not sure that combining the roles was the best thing, I&apos;m also not sure Ferrall did real justice to either try as he might on both. Kenneth Mars was the reclusive Nazi author of Springtime For Hitler. in the original. Both he and Shawn were almost as memorable as Mostel and Wilder.\n\nI do love the Mel Brooks humor, but I think he laid it on a bit thick with the gay stereotyping of Gary Beach and Roger Bart. It came this close to the good side of being offensive, but not quite.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot to like in this version of The Producers, but I think Mel should not have touched his masterpiece.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Starting out with a typical marriage counseling session, director Charlie McDowell and writer Justin Lader lull us into a movie-going comfort zone based on our experience with such Hollywood fluff as Hope Springs and Couples Retreat. All that should be said at this point is ... not so fast! \n\nA crumbling marriage and the subsequent lack of success with communication, leads therapist (Ted Danson) to recommend a weekend alone at a private country estate. The twists and turns that await Ethan (Mark Duplass) and Sophie (Elisabeth Moss), take marriage counseling to an entirely new spectrum. Sophie wants to reignite that early relationship spark and Ethan just wants things back to normal.\n\nThe setting does justice to the legend of beautiful California real estate, but things aren&apos;t all they seem as Ethan and Sophie bounce back and forth between the main house and guest house. It&apos;s in these moments where the big relationship questions are addressed ... and the script is smart, funny, creative and dark. It&apos;s not likely anyone can watch this without having some inner dialogue, and probably even some real discussion afterwards.\n\nMark Duplass (&quot;The League&quot;, Safety Not Guaranteed) and Elisabeth Moss (&quot;Mad Men&quot;) not only carry the film, but also take on significant responsibility with wide-ranging personality traits and subtle physical changes. Duplass is exceptional and easy for most guys to relate to in how he handles the challenges. While I&apos;ve never been a big fan of Ms. Moss, her performance here is quite impressive. Whether &quot;together&quot; or &quot;apart&quot;, they complement each other nicely.\n\nThe closest comparison I have for this one is Ruby Sparks (2012), but this one will have you questioning what makes a relationship work and what should we really expect in our partner. The idea of recapturing the initial spark is absurd, but that doesn&apos;t lessen the need for realistic expectations. For the first feature from director Charlie McDowell (son of Malcolm McDowell and Mary Steenburgen) and writer Justin Lader, the unique and creative approach to such a complex topic make these two people to keep an eye on.",

      "reviewBody": "In one of the most anticipated films of the Oscar season, Rob Marshall directs the adaptation of the Broadway musical, Nine. The film stars a studded-cast of A-list celebrities including Academy Award Winners Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Nicole Kidman, Sophia Loren, Oscar Nominee Kate Hudson, and Stacy Ferguson a.k.a. Fergie. What the film is proud of is ultimately its failure. \n\nMarshall, Oscar nominated for his breakthrough directorial debut Chicago, lost all the flavor and originality we once respected him for. The performances of most are right on target; get the job done, and sure to break through some awards buzz this season. The narrative by Michael Tolkin and the late Anthony Minghella is flat, unemotional, and vacant. The songs are tedious and a bit monotonous in their delivery, despite the cast surprisingly having good vocal chops. You would think that a big time musical such as Nine would have big notes that engage the viewer, and an interpretation that would move the viewer. None of those occur often enough in the film. Nine is not a failure, it just suffers major malfunctions that don&apos;t keep the machine moving. \n\nDaniel Day-Lewis helms the picture as Guido Contini, an Italian director looking for inspiration for his next film. Day-Lewis gives a solid effort which we haven&apos;t seen from him before but in comparison to his previous works in There Will Be Blood and Gangs of New York, he doesn&apos;t elevate the material as often or doesn&apos;t translate his musical numbers like he should. When he&apos;s not singing, Day-Lewis is in charge, in top form, and showing what he&apos;s always excelled at, decode a character&apos;s feelings and become an inferno of talent.\n\nMarion Cotillard is easily the most sentimental and profound player in the entire picture playing the heartrending Luisa, Guido&apos;s adulterated wife. What Cotillard has demonstrated beyond any type of acting capacity, a sexy, stylish, and devastating performance. With her two musical numbers, &quot;Take It All&quot; and &quot;My Husband Makes Movies,&quot; Cotillard improves and exalts one of the most poignant performances of the year. This is the single performance of the film that Oscar shouldn&apos;t miss out on.\n\nNicole Kidman, Oscar winning actress for The Hours, is as wasted as she is unimportant playing the beautiful Claudia, Guido&apos;s muse for his film. Kidman&apos;s one big scene of the film becomes a borefest of words that have no verbal value to the viewer or the story. Unfortunately Kidman is the forgettable cast mate that is ultimately invisible. She&apos;s unused, underwritten, and employed as movie wallpaper. For shame.\n\nJudi Dench as the costume designer Lilli has one big musical number which again is uninspired and lackluster. She has charisma in her speaking scenes and sort of upstages Day-Lewis much of the time, she eventually falls victim to a bland, insipid account.\n\nSophia Loren, the beautiful veteran Italian actress plays Mamma as in Guido&apos;s Mom, and gives a presence of royalty that the film lacks. She walks through the film with a manifestation of poise and allure. \n\nKate Hudson, as the cute Stephanie, the fashion critic for Vogue Magazine, is surprisingly fresh and fun. Her &quot;Cinema Italiano&quot; is one of the more pleasurable and enjoyable numbers in the film. It&apos;s nice to see Hudson give a bright, inventive cinematic turn in lines with her Oscar nominated work in Almost Famous.\n\nFergie is one of the sexier parts of the film as Saraghina, the lust of Guido&apos;s adolescence. Her &quot;Be Italian&quot; in terms of vocal capability is the best of the movie experience. Big notes, modern-like, and innovativeness, Fergie is one of the memorable players here but in terms of actual &quot;acting,&quot; she&apos;s never given the chance to show what she can do.\n\nPenelope Cruz, in one of her most aggressive and provocative turns yet plays the luscious Carla, Guido&apos;s married mistress. Cruz, in the film&apos;s opening number, is eager and provides hope to what seemed was going to be a promising experience. Along with Cotillard, Cruz is an Oscar worthy player. Fascinating, passionate, and enthusiastic along encompasses the traits in Ms. Cruz&apos;s arsenal.\n\nTechnically, the film sits very well. A stunning art director controlling the date and time of Marshall&apos;s film is quite good. Dion Beebe regulates our essential point of view and how dazzling it can look despite any flaws narratively. At it again, Colleen Atwood shows how she&apos;s one of the top designers in the business. Marshall in the end copycats himself, which is not a directorial style rather a Chicago-repeat without the razzle-dazzle.\n\nConsequently, Rob Marshall&apos;s Nine isn&apos;t terrible, which doesn&apos;t say much. It&apos;s passable, average, and done before. It may not have been the screen writers liability for the strikeout, it&apos;s just an un-fascinating and awkwardly weak show. Nine, the film, however, is awkwardly coy, which is not an imaginative sense that the viewer anticipated. Nine in the end, in the finale, walking out of the theater, everything you thought about it, levels out just fine, which I guess is admirable. Is it Oscar bound? Unfortunately yes.\n\n**½/****",

      "name": "A Film About the Destructiveness of Sex Obsession",
      "reviewBody": "I think most people don&apos;t understand this movie. This is not a love story, at least not in the conventional sense. &quot;9 1/2 weeks&quot; is about sexual desire and intimate sensuality run amok and becoming the monopolizing forces in a relationship, and the ultimate demise of that relationship as a result. Certainly the physical pleasures and sensuality of sex are aspects that make a relationship fulfilling and gratifying but they are not the only facets. A relationship purely based on sexual desire is doomed to failure. At first it seems like a game, but later on the intensity is too much for the relationship to withstand, largely because if love and caring are sacrificed for the sex, it will die.\n\nYou almost couldn&apos;t find more suitable casting than Mickey Roarke and Kim Bassinger. Roarke plays John, a sexually-driven finance executive who is not satisfied with winning over the woman he wants. He craves continual heightened sexual excitement from his &quot;lady friend&quot;. And he uses subtle coercion to achieve his goals. For Elizabeth, played by Bassinger, John is the ideal lover. He makes her breakfast, buys her clothes, brushes her hair. He takes care of her in an interesting role reversal. But nothing is free. In return, John wants Elizabeth to be in his complete control and engage in sensuous sex games. And each game is more intense than the last.\n\nAt first the games seem innocent enough. He likes to blindfold her and play a touchy-feely game in which he introduces objects that she feels and/or tastes. But then the requests become more intense. He wants her to enact a strip-tease, to dress in a certain way without her consent, and to receive a spanking for being a &quot;nosey parker&quot;. They have sex in the oddest of places, sometimes engaging in intimate contact in public. At first Elizabeth enjoys the attention and the excitement until she begins to lose the sense of herself as the relationship intensifies. And John eventually goes too far. \n\nAt one poignant moment in the film, Elizabeth speaks with an artist-recluse. Because her job is at an art gallery, she helps coordinate artists for exhibitions. When she finds him in a rural area, she asks him if he remembered that his exhibition is coming up. He replies that when he is hungry he remembers to eat and when he is tired he remembers to sleep. She has lost the simpler pleasures of life, and this old man reminds her of that. \n\nLate in the film there is an interesting scene where Elizabeth&apos;s former boyfriend comes to the place she works--not to see her but he is now dating one of her co-workers. He&apos;s a plain man who does not have nearly the sexual allure of Roarke. But he seems kind and honest. Liz watches her co-worker and her former boyfriend leave and there is an expression on her face that speaks volumes: maybe she misjudged him after-all. For a moment, the two stare at each other from a distance, and you get the feeling that she was the one who left him. He is not the Mr Exciting that John is, but maybe he has other qualities that John could never have.\n\nThis is quite a stunning film, certainly not for all tastes, and some of the steamy sex scenes could be misinterpreted as being only for pornographic sake. What saves it are the incredible and absolutely believable performances by the two leads, Roarke and Bassinger which strangely complement one another. Roarke plays his character right on the money, always enigmatic, never raising his voice, but always mysterious. His character is always just outside of reach. He constantly smiles, even when he is noticeable disappointed. Basinger is a perfect complement as one of the few actresses left who can be vulnerable and elicit a willingness to be under control that you don&apos;t see in many female performances anymore. Despite what may appear to be pornography, there is a point to the film I think, and that is that constant sexual control and nurturing relationships mix like oil and water. In the end you wonder if it was all a game.",

      "name": "A Return to Practical Effects",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Void&quot; has been compared, quite a bit, to John Carpenter&apos;s 1980&apos;s remake of &quot;The Thing&quot;, and understandably so. The use of practical effects in this movie are really its highest selling point. Like &quot;The Thing&quot;, this film does not shy away from showing you some extremely well crafted and effective monsters. However, to compare this film with &quot;The Thing&quot; for reasons outside of practical effects, does not make a lot of sense.\n\nIn short, &quot;The Void&quot;, is well worth a watch. If the trailer interested you, the movie will absolutely deliver. In a recent rash of indie horror films, &quot;The Void&quot; stands out for several reasons. In many of the recent indie horror films, there is usually something glaring that needs to be overlooked in order to make the film enjoyable. Whether it be poor acting, loose plot lines, or an over abundance of things that attempt to shock, many recent indie horror titles have been held back by mediocrity. &quot;The Void&quot; as a sum of its individual parts its a well crafted and enjoyable ride that I would feel comfortable recommending to most horror fans. The special effects are easily its highest selling point, but the film is held together by a decent story line and fair acting. The characters are believable for the most part, and the story does a good job explaining the necessity of the effects.\n\nWhere the film falters the most however, is in its lack of atmosphere. The film feels as if it should be claustrophobic and isolating, but for some reason, I was unable to connect with these themes. I am usually an advocate for a movie telling less to the audience, in order for the viewer to create some of the more frightening aspects in their mind, bu with this particular film, I was left wanting more exposition. Unlike the original &quot;Hellraiser&quot; film, &quot;The Void&quot; did not leave the origins of the monsters creation completely unexplained, but the origin story was a little to vague, and it made it difficult to connect as deeply to the conclusion of the film as I may have liked.\n\nOverall, &quot;The Void&quot; is a good movie to throw on for a horror movie night with some friends who enjoy some good over the top gore and monster effects.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Michael Mann sure loves his diner scenes. The scene in which Frank takes Jessie to the diner might very well be my favorite of the film, as it steadily proves that this more than just a film about heists and tough guys. James Caan is perfectly cast as Frank, and throughout the film he holds the weight of his performance up as if it were only five pounds, portraying Frank as tough, fearless and thick skinned. But in the diner, as well as in his interactions with Okla (played by Willie Nelson!!!) he is able to open us up to more. The photo Frank has in his wallet is a very strange yet alluring glimpse inside his mind and his heart that he would not otherwise show. Tuesday Weld&apos;s reactions as Jessie also help show us how he is slowly winning her over not just by being aggressive, but by showing vulnerability. From then on, I knew the film had established itself as a great one, as I now clearly understood Frank&apos;s true motivations. It proved to me that the film is just as much a character study than is a heist and gangster film. And boy, does it deliver on both fronts.",

Violence is violence everywhere.\n\nIf you compare this movie against other great Asian action movie directors, than I think it&apos;s not that special. It&apos;s well done, but it&apos;s ultimately a light movie. A bit like an Asian version of an Hollywood action movie. There are some moments though (the end comes to mind), where the movie does show some signs of self awareness. But overall, it&apos;s a fairly straightforward, over the top gangster movie.

      "reviewBody": "Biographical movies are always fascinating. If it is not something worthy, the movie would have not taken up the shape. It was a very good movie, and a very important historical subject. It has been 100 years since and now the world we live-in is much different and better. I think after thousands of years, now the women got their freedom.\n\nI thought I knew this story very well, but it was &apos;Made in Dagenham&apos; which is quite similar to this which is also based on the real. Both the stories take place 50 years apart, but this one was the beginning of a new era for women, not without sacrifices and sufferings.\n\nGreat actors, great actings, awesome storytelling, cinematography at its best, direction was amazing and the music was so pleasant, but the method of dealing was a bit gruesome, and sometimes brutal. I thought the terrorism is a new word, but this movie gives a different perspective and meaning to that.\n\nYou would definitely love this film if you respect women. All women cast movie, including the director, but for everyone. It might have begun in the UK, but the entire planet saw a drastic change and still taking place in some places. I don&apos;t see any reason why I should not recommend it to you.\n\n8/10",

It has something for everyone to connect with. Beautifully put together and performed. But be warned, this is one moving movie. Even the toughest of guys will need the Kleenex nearby. My face was wet! Just as you have managed to hold back one tear-jerker response, along comes another. A real emotional roller-coaster which leaves you in awe at the end. Best real movie I&apos;ve seen in a long time. Kevin was amazing. So was Amanda and Milo. Real characters with real feeling. You should all be so proud of this. My friend read the book and said it had the same affect. Clearly you have done the book due justice. Just Fabulous!",

      "reviewBody": "The very notion of Shaun The Sheep Movie sounds faintly ridiculous, as if the universe were playing a joke on movie-going audiences around the world. A hyper-intelligent sheep embarking on an epic adventure to save the farmer who shears off his wool every year? What utter claptrap. The film has next to no lines of intelligible dialogue and is based on a long-running TV show for kids? How ludicrous. Is anyone above the age of three actually expected to want to watch this film? And yet, there&apos;s plenty to recommend this charming, full-hearted gem from Aardman Animation - a studio so passionate and dedicated to its craft and characters that it literally animates entire worlds in exhaustingly tiny increments.\n\nEveryone in Mossy Bottom Farm, including our titular hero (given &apos;voice&apos; by Justin Fletcher), has settled into a dreary routine. One day, Shaun decides to shake things up a little. So he distracts sheepdog Bitzer and traps the Farmer (both voiced by John Sparkes) in a caravan, all in aid of allowing his entire flock to take a day off from their boring lives. But Shaun didn&apos;t account for a steep hill, a runaway caravan and a bout of amnesia. Soon, he and his buddies - with the help of Bitzer and stray pooch Slip (Tim Hands) - must hunt for the Farmer in the Big City, even as they try to keep out of the clutches of Trumper (Omid Djalili), a fearsome agent tasked with Animal Control.\n\nIt&apos;s easy to gripe about Shaun The Sheep&apos;s simple plot: this is hardly a complex film. Indeed, it lingers obstinately in the realm of entertainment for kids, even packing in the requisite learning points about friendship and not taking things for granted. The film can sometimes feel simplistic too, given its persistent lack of dialogue and its cheerfully frequent descent into slapstick comedy. There&apos;s very little of the cheeky satire here that makes Aardman&apos;s Wallace &amp; Gromit franchise such a blast.\n\nBut Shaun The Sheep Movie is delightful in so many ways that it&apos;s just easier for everyone above a certain age to give in to their inner child. The characters may be fashioned out of clay and wood and painstakingly animated at an extremely slow speed, but the film itself positively crackles with energy. The narrative pokes fun at the concepts of fashion, incarceration and going viral, even as it bounces merrily through a host of hilarious gags. The soporific effect of sheep leaping over fences is mined for plenty of laughs, while the camera checks in with a particularly crazed inmate of Animal Control and an utterly charming Baa-bershop Quintet. \n\nQuite a bit of thought has evidently been devoted to the development of the film&apos;s main characters - certainly more than you&apos;d get in some Hollywood blockbusters. Shaun is a sweetly determined hero, refusing to leave any sheep - or human, or dog - behind, even as he cleans up a mess that is (strictly speaking) of his own making. The Farmer, too, gets a storyline that spices the comedy up with a hint of drama, as he stumbles into a new career through his forgotten but deeply-ingrained skill with shearing sheep. The lack of dialogue in the film also proves to be, quite frequently, a plus. Not only does it push the story in inventive directions, it allows the incredibly expressive characters to take centre stage - their hopes, dreams and fears communicated with barely a word spoken.\n\nThis all makes for a thoroughly charming experience at the cinema - Shaun The Sheep Movie isn&apos;t likely to make you dig deep or ponder long and hard about life, but it will almost certainly entertain you in breathtaking (and breathless!) fashion. In almost every aspect - from the deft character design to its incredibly catchy soundtrack, the film radiates a sweet, optimistic charm that will win over just about everybody who gives it a chance.",

Kevin Kline is one of my favourite actors, and after seeing this, I&apos;m still firm in the belief that he can pull off any role he has a mind to. Joan Cusack&apos;s performance, while too over-the-top for some, really worked well for the part in my opinion... she and Kline both kept me laughing throughout. The supporting cast turned in nice performances as well, and Tom Selleck needs to keep that face clean-shaven more often. ^_-\n\nThis film was still quite amusing in some parts, but it seemed to indulge in a few too many stereotypes.\n\nOverall, I think the actors did the best they could with what they were given, and while it wasn&apos;t *quite* what I had hoped for, it was still good entertainment for an afternoon... if you&apos;re not too sensitive about the Heterosexual vs. Homosexual issue, then you&apos;ll probably get quite a few good laughs out of this one."

I rented it due to the &quot;horse&quot; plot and it ended up being a very important movie in my life. I was involved in some very personal problems with my family at the time. What was important to me was that even with the terrible situation Grace was in, there was a way to heal. The most important line in the movie was when Tom Booker makes the comment: &quot;Knowing it is the easy part, saying it out loud is what&apos;s difficult&quot; Oh how true this is. A lot of good thoughts in this one. It has my highest recommendation.",

      "reviewBody": "When this movie hits theaters this fall it will be setting a new standard for digital FX photography action scenes. I had a hard time telling the difference between the real stunt flying and the CGI. It almost makes George Lucas&apos;s dogfights in space look crude. (OK, maybe with the exception of that fantastic first shot in Episode 3.) But imagine that level of technological knowhow applied to a WW1 dogfight. And like the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; there is a scene here involving the German equivalent of the Death Star threatening Paris that is nothing short of spectacular. A shame, then, that the rest of the story is less than inspiring. Whatever the actual history, I didn&apos;t quite believe the subplot of the black American pilot. He seemed a cliché and just one of several stock characters. The love story ultimately goes nowhere, either, though James Franco and Jennifer Decker both turn in moving performances. As innocent and naive as Franco and his friends seem, they never get past the cardboard stage. It would&apos;ve been more interesting to me if they were a neurotic, drunken, whoring bunch of elitists, most of whom would then never get over the experience. Rather than tell that tale of a decadent, sophisticated flyboy of the Lafayette Escadrille, however, they settle here for the Disney version, appealing to the lowest common denominator and an audience of teenagers, with Franco doing a good job playing Luke Skywalker, or maybe Gary Cooper. Jean Reno seemed largely wasted. I kept hoping he&apos;d have more to do. But lest you think I had a bad time, think again. This is a movie about &quot;aeroplanes,&quot; and they are all terrific, be they replicas or virtual. And the overall production design is superb.",

Trust had me hooked from the first few minutes. The subject matter is controversial to say the least but I feel it has been handled very well here. In no way does it feel exploitative, in fact in some areas I felt it was almost like a documentary.\n\nExtremely hard to stomach in places it does not overdo the shock factor as it may have done in other hands. The cast are superb, there is not as I can see a weak link anywhere.\n\nThe only problem with this film is it&apos;s certification. Rating it R means that the people who should be watching it can&apos;t. IMHO this film should be given to every high/secondary school worldwide as Schindler&apos;s List was.\n\nIf you have kids watch this film. Them watch it with your kids!

      "reviewBody": "I was really excited to see this movie, and while I enjoyed the movie, I was ultimately left dissatisfied, because Cronenberg is capable of making better films. This movie basically explores a lot of the same themes as Crash, eXistenZ (did i spell that right?) and Dead Ringers, and sort of throws them together. I think it was miles beyond what eXistenZ was, but not as good as Dead Ringers, and nowhere near as good as Crash.\n\nThe pros: Acting is great, Scott Speedman was surprisingly really good in his performance, concept of the film is great\n\nThe mehs: Soundtrack, I feel like you could slap any of Howard Shore&apos;s Cronenberg soundtracks onto this one, and it wouldn&apos;t matter, it&apos;s there, it probably doesn&apos;t need to be though, for me it doesn&apos;t add anything, which makes me wonder if I would have enjoyed this move more if it didn&apos;t have a soundtrack...and I think I would. I think maybe going for something ambient over orchestral would have worked better as well, but I guess you can&apos;t teach an old dog new tricks. People have been talking about how gross some of the stuff is in the movie, but in all honesty, after watching it, I feel like Cronenberg and or the production company pays people to talk about how hard it is to watch, to build hype. Pretty tame in the gross out department if you ask me, which is fine, because I think all of the surgical stuff that&apos;s happening was delivered at a very appropriate level, not off putting to watch.\n\nThe cons: the costume design is hokey, Viggo Mortensen&apos;s ninja poncho hoodie thing looks silly, the set design is really boring, the design of the various apparatuses that characters are connected to (the autopsy machine, the eating chair thing, the bed) all look like cheap plastic crap, and I don&apos;t think that was intentional, the way they&apos;re presented is as elaborate pieces of technology, but they look cheap and idiotic, and it really killed any engagement that I had, it kept reminding me that I was watching a movie with bad props, I&apos;m glad he used props instead of CGI, but these just look like crap. The props and makeup in Naked Lunch worked, these look like they were props that were discarded from Naked Lunch&apos;s props department because they weren&apos;t good enough to use. Lastly the final con of the film is the script, the entire plot is fantastic, it&apos;s well thought out, but when you&apos;re dealing with complex themes and subject matter, why would you write a script that tries to explain what&apos;s going on like a 3 year old is watching the movie? The script is patronizing to the viewer, and I felt cheated when I listened to the dialogue. Characters don&apos;t need to explain to the audience what&apos;s happening when we&apos;re already watching it, most of the dialogue is a narration of the plot and the themes, and it&apos;s irritating to sit through.",

A stroke of bold genius by Michael Nyman (the brilliant composer of &quot;The Piano&quot;). The score has been nominated for several awards.\n\nHard to imagine 20th Century Fox&apos;s reaction when they saw the final film and needed to market it... But there&apos;s plenty to enjoy here. 8 out of 10!",

      "reviewBody": "In Connecticut, the widower and lonely Professor Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins) has a boring life teaching for one class only in the college and trying to learn how to play piano despite not having the necessary musical talent. Walter is assigned to attend a conference about Global Policy and Development in the New York University and give a lecture about a paper that he is coauthor. When he arrives in his apartment in New York, he finds the Syrian musician Tarek Khalil (Haaz Sleiman) and the Senegalese street vendor Zainab (Danai Gurira) living there. He sympathizes with the situation of the illegal immigrants and invites the couple to stay with him. Tarek invites him to go to his gig in the Jules Live Jazz and Walter is fascinated with his African drum; then Tarek offers to teach Walter to play the drum. However, after an incident in the subway, Tarek is arrested by the police and sent to a detention center of immigrants. Walter hires a lawyer to defend Tarek and out of the blue, Tarek&apos;s mother Mouna Khalil (Hiam Abbass) appears in Walter&apos;s apartment coming from Michigan; he invites her to stay in Tarek&apos;s room and while trying to release Tarek, Walter and Mouna get close to each other and he finds a reason to live an exciting life again.\n\n&quot;The Visitor&quot; is a touching and realistic tale of friendship and self- discovery in a world of intolerance. It is ironic to see the poster &quot;Immigrants – The Strength of America&quot; and sad to see the arrogance of the officers responsible for the security. The story is supported by an excellent screenplay; a simple and effective direction of Thomas McCarthy, who is also the writer; and magnificent performances of the cast. The always awesome Richard Jenkins, who plays a middle-aged intellectual that lives a senseless life after the death of his wife that finds a reason to live with music, the elegant Hiam Abbass that helps Walter to find the meaning of life together with her son, performed by the unknown Haaz Sleiman have an amazing work. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Visitante&quot; (&quot;The Visitor&quot;)",

I was shocked to find not only a NOT bad movie. and not only an &quot;OK&quot; movie, but what, for me, was a really great movie! Of course I am a solid Sandra Bullock fan. I thought this movie took some interesting elements (Thomas Hayden Church&apos;s characters, for example, are usually so smarmy and sleazy they are unpleasant to see, especially given that he is such a good actor, he pulls the worst out of his characters), and played them together very well.\n\nFortunately, we don&apos;t all admire or like the same things in the opposite sex. What many often cluck over in celebrity ladies often leaves me cold, feeling as if I had brushed up against a self-absorbed block of ice. Bullock&apos;s on-screen persona is always a warm, earthy, personable sort. Matey. Chummy. It&apos;s the films, of course, so her traits are artificially heightened, but I LIKE those kinds of women in the real world. From all that I hear and have seen over the years, Bullock seems to be the real deal--- her on-screen persona is not terribly far from her real life personality. Whatever... but the point is that she brings a loveliness and kindness to her roles that I enjoy.\n\nThe critics have been unfairly beating up on this movie, I think. Granted, it&apos;s a rom-com, and a bit silly, but if I wanted hard-core reality, or gritty tragedy, I&apos;d watch the news, or &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot; or something. I&apos;d stay home and stare at my friends, or in the mirror, for free. I want to be delighted and uplifted at the cinema, and this film did exactly that. Hurray for Sandra Bullock and the &quot;All About Steve&quot; production team!",

      "reviewBody": "The Reaping is one of the many high budget horror movies, doing their best to &quot;resurrect&quot; the genre. Although being watchable and even creative at times, it fails to complete the mission.\n\nKatherine Winter is sent to a small town with the task of solving the death of a boy. She soon finds out the river, the boy&apos;s body has been found, is red. Locals claim it&apos;s human blood, but Katherine refuses to believe.\n\nStephen Hopkins, a popular director, makes another movie that is almost successful, but couple of wrong decisions affect the overall result. I really can&apos;t say I was disappointed. For my surprise, Swank is not a miscast. She does a decent, believable performance. The film&apos;s major mistakes involve needless plot details that could easily annoy the viewer.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of the film, clichés take over the action. Most of the plot ending becomes predictable. Pointless, long scenes of flashbacks, romances and dialogs contradicts the general idea of the film. The second act is almost not horror, but a rather dramatic ride through Katherine&apos;s past. It&apos;s obvious that the movie depends too much on good acting moments. Something that is not typical for horror and so, I was normally upset by the emptiness of some scenes. Emptiness, that nearly made me fall asleep.\n\nHopkins&apos;s movie has the premises. It isn&apos;t only the high-budget and big names to help the movie reach the theaters. The story involves element from the religion which appears to be a really big cliché these days. However, the structure of the film remains balanced thanks to the good writing. The idea of Katherine&apos;s personal nightmares, being a barrier between reality and illusion fits perfectly into the plot. \n\nThere are also some great visuals that recreate a feeling of realistic terror.\n\nThe Reaping could have been better, but still, it deserves a look. There are some impressive scenes, I&apos;m sure all whimsical horror fans will like.",

      "reviewBody": "Never have I been so uncomfortable so long a period of time. Normally movies have a scene that shifts into the distressing/uncomfortable and you&apos;re like &quot;wow, what a great scene.&quot;\n\nThat&apos;s the whole movie. Except for about 3 light moments scattered throughout the subject matter of conversion therapy and the environment our protagonist Jared is literally TRAPPED in is awful. The homophobia and control that the Love In Action conversion program enforces over the poor souls inducted into this brainwashing camp becomes increasingly extreme. The way it causes distress and breaks people is shown differently through the various side characters and none of it is good. This is a tragic story of the real abuse of LGBT people happening in the US (and gay conversion therapy isn&apos;t explicitly banned everywhere in Aus either).\n\nI was on the edge of my seat, deeply breathing, sighing, putting my hands to my face in awe and distress, the whole way through. Just when I thought this movie couldn&apos;t get more uncomfortable it finds a new height.\n\nIt achieves all this through plot and intimate performances. Everything else is so stripped back and naturalistic. There&apos;s barely any music, or at least not very noticeable background music (with the exception of the song Revelation by Troye Sivan/Jonsi, which will likely vie for a nomination for best original song). It looks like they almost didn&apos;t have a lighting crew for more of the film, instead relying on house lighting for a dark, moody, or contrasting aesthetic. The whole thing feels not like a stylistic piece of cinema, but a realistic look at a person&apos;s life. Which is the point given it is inspired by the real experiences of someone who suffered through the abuse of conversion therapy. This film is so well put together.\n\nI never want to watch it again. Which is weird for a film I love so much. But this movie is harrowing. It haunts me. I don&apos;t get very emotional over film but this subject and execution was just so deeply uncomfortable for such a long period of time that I don&apos;t feel the need to ever subject myself to that again. Which is a great recommendation if you want something to make you feel sad/distressed for nearly 2 hours straight.",

      "reviewBody": "Every 1000 years a child is born who can wield the power of two halves of a supernatural medallion, which can bestow superhuman strength and immortality, as well as take life away. Snakehead (Julian Sands), your typical crook with world domination ambitions, has discovered the identity of a modern-day chosen child, and pursues him. Meanwhile, Hong Kong police detective Eddie Yang (Jackie Chan) and Interpol agents Arthur Watson (Lee Evans) and Nicole James (Claire Forlani) have been pursuing Snakehead because of his criminal activities, and stumble into the grander scheme.\n\nWhile The Medallion is certainly not a film without flaws, it is satisfying on the whole if you approach it as a comic book/cartoon-styled Jackie Chan actioner. The film combines even more genres than that, actually, and there are times when it seems almost to be a spoof of James Bond-styled thrillers. There are also more straightforward comedy elements--especially when Evans is on screen, the film almost becomes a slapstick farce--there are Matrix-styled fantasy/action aspects, and there is a romance subplot. On top of all of that, The Medallion moves very quickly. Director Gordon Chan packs a lot of information into the film and barely pauses for a breath--if you blink, you&apos;re likely to miss some bit of crucial action, a plot point, or a joke.\n\nIn short, it&apos;s a complex stew of different genres, with a mixture of adult themes and childlike lightheartedness, wrapped in a dense mythology of fantasy and served at a non-stop, breakneck pace. Undoubtedly, those qualities will turn off a great deal of viewers, whether because they hate MTV/attention-deficit-disorder-styled editing, genre hopping or a lack of real-world believability. I don&apos;t mind any of those qualities, and in fact I tend to prefer films that forgo realism.\n\nI only had two small complaints about The Medallion. One, it took me a few scenes to get up to speed with the film, both plot-wise and in terms of style. Once I got into the groove, though, I didn&apos;t want the film to stop--enough that my second complaint is that the film was too short (and in general, I strongly dislike the fact that most films seem to be forced by studios to end within 90 minutes). I wanted to see more of these characters, especially Evans, who stole most of the scenes he appeared in. Jackie Chan fans seeking a return to films that are solely kung fu-oriented will likely be disappointed, but if you have broader tastes, The Medallion might hit the spot. An 8 out of 10 from me.",

It&apos;s a light, fun entertaining comedy, as focused on friendship as romance. Of course Noah is not a &apos;great ak-torrr&apos; (certainly not at this stage) but he does what he&apos;s supposed to do perfectly here - which is to be gorgeous and charming and funny. If that&apos;s not what you&apos;re after, then this is not the movie for you.\n\nOverall this is a nice, comforting, escapist way to spend 90 minutes.

      "reviewBody": "A film crew documents the activities of psychopathic professional killer Benoit (Benoît Poelvoorde).\n\nMan Bites Dog is, to begin with, a pitch black comedy in which the absurdity of a documentary team recording a killer at work provides the uncomfortable humour. Benoit&apos;s actions are reprehensible, but too ridiculous not to find amusing, the killer starting the month by killing a postman, then preying on gullible OAPs from whom he steals their life savings (always creative in his work, Benoit literally scares one old dear to death). Benoit talks to the camera about his work, discussing his methods and techniques, whilst lapsing into moments of poetry and artistic reflection.\n\nThis somewhat whimsical approach doesn&apos;t prepare the viewer for the more harrowing content in the latter half of the movie, which provides an emotional punch that really drives home the horror of its subject&apos;s lifestyle. When Benoit kills a family, including a young boy, the grim reality hits home, and is compounded by the subsequent gruelling gang rape, murder and mutilation of a woman, the crew of the documentary not just recording the act but participating in it as well. This shift in tone from black comedy to genuinely disturbing shockumentary continues as Benoit displays his dangerous unpredictability by suddenly executing a guest at his dinner table. The end of the film sees the psychopath&apos;s loved ones brutally murdered by his rivals, who then turn their attention to Benoit and his film crew.\n\nAdmittedly, at times, Man Bites Dog can be an overly talky affair, both ponderous and a tad pretentious (presumably deliberately so), but the more shocking scenes guarantee that the film will stick with you long after the credits have rolled.\n\n7/10. For fans of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Natural Born Killers and The Blair Witch Project (which surely &apos;borrowed&apos; its ending from Man Bites Dog).",

      "reviewBody": "A straight up western starring Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green, Jeffery Dean Morgan, and even Eric Cantona. Danish production, shot in South Africa, it looked convincingly American west. It&apos;s very old school in its story, good guy vs bad guy, revenge, gun fights, the whole nine yards. And it&apos;s a pretty fine movie too.\n\nDanish guy waits for his wife and son to arrive in America to start new lives, but bad guys are going to spoil their plan. There&apos;s no way he&apos;s going to let them bad guys go, after toiling for 7 years to start a new life only to see it destroyed as soon as his family arrives. And did I mention he fought wars in the Danish army before he moved to America? Oh yeah, this Dane know how to shoot straight too.\n\nYou really do get the feeling that this guy wants no trouble and just wants to get on with his life, but it&apos;s trouble that comes looking for him. A lot of new westerns tend to be &quot;different&quot; and avoid the straight up good vs bad revenge trope because it&apos;s been done to death during the genre&apos;s heyday. But I think it&apos;s a good time revisit that trope with today&apos;s new talent and technology. The story may be cliché, but everything else feels fresh. The best western I&apos;ve watched in a long time.",

      "reviewBody": "Meet Dave is the story of a crew of miniature people inhabiting a big robot who has come to Earth on a mission to save his people. Eddie Murphy plays the Captain of the vessel and the outward version of the vessel which as automaton has limited capacity for emotion. However after he is damaged in a collision with a vehicle he decides to attempt to learn more about these earth people, spending time with Gina who ran him over and her son Josh, who worries that he isn&apos;t a hero like his late father. As you can tell from what&apos;s been written so far, this is no kitchen sink drama but a light-hearted Disney-esquire comedy.\n\nMeet Dave is a fun family film that doesn&apos;t challenge us too much and has it&apos;s heart in the right place. There is plenty of toilet humour which kids always love and some genuinely funny moments throughout, I laughed, the audience laughed. We did not pelt the screen in outrage and nor did we sit there in silence for 2 hours as we did with the film I mentioned to start with. The film is like a cross between &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; and &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; and while the humour is more akin to the latter &quot;Dolittle&quot; this is still a fun family film. So why three or less? \n\nI think that for many film reviewers that sit through and be nice to the usual tripe that passes for entertainment over this season there has to be a villain, a film that they slate that then bombs as a result, and sadly this is that film. I also suspect that there is also an element of &quot;compromise movie on a date&quot; disappointment and maybe even a few &quot;The film I wanted to see was full and I have to sit through this&quot; resentments going on. Having seen some truly terrible mediocre films that critics rave about like &quot;Charlie&apos;s Angels&quot; and &quot;Forty days and forty nights&quot; these films that no critic has the b*lls to slag off for fear they won&apos;t be invited to more screenings, well boo hoo! I have no cross to bear in that department and this is a film that is funny when it wants to be, it means well, and, whilst it is a tad predictable, the same age group of kids that liked &quot;Dr Dolittle&quot; will certainly like this, especially appropriate for younger children who may find &quot;WALL-E&quot; hard going, bearing in mind it is great for adults and older children, but not necessarily very young kids. P\n\nCritics are just jumping on the bandwagon to attack this film, it really isn&apos;t as bad as the examples I&apos;ve mentioned. The only drawback in this film is that the effects aren&apos;t particularly great at a number of points but better to have a film that&apos;s okay with poor effects than poor with okay effects. \n\nIf your family enjoyed Firehouse Dog, and the silly humour of that, chances are they&apos;ll like this.\n\nFamily Fun",

      "reviewBody": "I am a single, 67 year old retiree, who has been married and divorced twice; and this movie really touched me. It acted as a sort of cinematic mirror to prompt me to reflect upon the many daily choices, or even finer gradations of volition, that make up a healthy or dysfunctional marriage or relationship of any kind. The movie was about how we create our own heaven or hell, in the house, in the kitchen, in the bedroom, and in life. We lose our grip on our passionate love affairs almost the way that dust slowly collects on the floor. Didn&apos;t I just vacuum that dust yesterday? That is how a marriage can ossify, degrade itself, as if consciousness itself were shot full of some sort of novocaine by sneaky subtle injections over the years, one feeling at a time numbed.\n\nMeryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carrell are excellent and break new emotional and acting ground for all three master actors.\n\nThe movie made me think about my entire life, and it made me reflect upon my parents&apos; marriage, too.\n\nTommy Lee Jones&apos; portrayal of Arnold, a man who has been an accountant so long he can simply function on automatic with his customers, not really giving his passionate self to his business- or his marriage, ran the gamut from acceptance of various ruts to various kinds of rage, embarrassment, and stubbornness, refusal to drop his pride, or make compromises that would have been in the best interests of himself, his wife and the marriage.\n\nThe camera does not editorialize. It shows Arnold falling asleep watching golf instruction on television. The camera directly above the frying pan and close up, depicts Meryl Streep&apos;s Kay, sizzling a strip of bacon and one sunny side up egg for Arnold every day, day after day. He eats his breakfast with his back to her as he reads the paper, then gets up, every day, and gives her a peck on the check without even making eye contact, and he&apos;s off to work again- like an unemotional little engine that could.\n\nWhen Sisyphus pushed that boulder up to the top of the hill, his punishment by the gods, he had to watch it roll back down to the bottom of the hill whereupon, he repeated this process - for eternity. But Sisyphus smiled - at least according to Albert Camus, he smiled. It occurred to me that relationships and marriages devolve into accommodations, and that passion, like air being spent out the tiny leaks in a worn tire, can evanesce before either party truly, deeply realizes what they are doing, what they have done. The smiles in this movie are forced, automatic, defensive, painful. Boulders are not openly acknowledged.\n\nIn this movie, every scene is slightly underplayed. No line or gesture is over the top. Almost every word of dialogue is realistic. I never felt that I was being lectured or preached to. I did think that the background music was too intrusive several times, however, almost as if someone did not trust Meryl Streep to carry the emotional load of the scene - an error of judgement. This movie needed no such authorial or directorial intrusion - That is my only criticism.\n\n&quot;Hope Springs&quot; is a movie about the ingredients of happiness or lack of same, and the finesse of the actors, the director, the cinematographer and the editors is magnificent. They never stooped to dwell on any sort of cliché dialogue or acting flourishes. It was believable.\n\nI felt that the movie really opened up my life. I wish I had seen it 45 years ago when I married for the first time. It is that good.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie came as a surprise to me. When it was first released it was praised by most of the Norwegian film critics as a very good film, some even went as far as calling it a masterpiece.\n\nBut this happens quite often with Norwegian films, our critics tend to give domestic films a higher score than usual. One critic in this case even admitted to have done so in her own review. She gave the movie 10/10 and called it a masterpiece &quot;Seen with Norwegian eyes&quot;, but not that impressive seen with international eyes.\n\nNow i hate this kind of criticism, i think that the nationality of the product. if it be music, film, games, painting or any other form of art, the criticism should be based on the end product as it stands. Though i also can understand that some get more emotional when they see their own language spoken in a film like this.\n\nAnd by that i mean this. Norway does not make that many movies that has millions of dollars of special effects in them, that is rare. And here they spent over half the film budget on making the wave, which has like 2 minutes of screen time in total. And yes it does look quite impressive, i have to say.\n\nI know a few people that has worked on making this wave and i remember i told them, that this is the one thing they cannot fail. If the wave does not look impressive, they can just give up and go home. Now i don&apos;t think my words had any impact on the production of the wave, just to clear that up :).\n\nAnyways i did not know much about the story, only the obvious things. So i went into seeing this film with an open mind.\n\nAnd here comes what is the best thing about this film. The buildup. Oh boy is this film impressively built up to the climax, oh yes it is. Actually there has been years since i have seen such a perfectly orchestrated start of a film. It spends just enough time with the lead actors and actresses to spark an interest in them, and then avoids it becoming boring and unnecessary, and also to finally show what this film is all about.\n\nThen the climax itself is done very well. Actually i was very impressed indeed when the mountain burst and went into the water. Up till this point i almost could not believe what i saw, i was actually looking at something extraordinary. And that, felt really good. But, then comes the aftermath.\n\nNow I&apos;m not going to spoil anything here, but i will say this. The movie slowly gets weaker and weaker the closer to end we approach. The acting is above decent at all times, but the storytelling plummets in the last 30 minutes or so. They just have to add something to the film, and what they add is the most predictable of all things, family in danger.\n\nAnd then on top of that they just borrow scenes from other movies, like the abyss, and portray them almost identical to the original scenes from those other movies. That is a shame. I wished they had spent some extra time coming up with something original. So the movie had something to deliver after the wave.\n\nBut sadly it does not. Had i stopped watching this film 25 minutes before the end, the movie would have felt like a 9/10. Impressive indeed. But the ending, as cliché as it is, does not par with the rest of the film, and thus brings the whole experience down.\n\nTo wrap it up i got to say, I&apos;m going to watch the beginning of this film until the climax, many many times over the next few years, that is where they nailed it, and where they showed us it&apos;s still hope for action films made in my country.\n\nAnd Ane Dahl Torp is looking better and better the older she gets, which is even more impressive. And she does one of her best performances.\n\nKristoffer Joner also delivers a steady and really good performance.\n\nVerdict: 7/10 - Quite good\n\nFirst 50 minutes: 9/10 - Very good. (I just had to add that).",

      "reviewBody": "I had read the story of Jim White and the McFarland cross country team long before the movie came out. I was glad to see it made into a feature film, but Disney&apos;s heavy hands keep it from being fully satisfying.\n\nMost of the actors playing larger roles acquit themselves well. Yes, Kevin Costner is his overly familiar world-weary self, but there&apos;s always a certain charm in seeing him inhabit that role. Many of the young men portraying McFarland&apos;s runners are both charming and believable, and some of the quirky townspeople (such as the mother of three runners and the owner of the local variety store) add nice depth to the story.\n\nIn addition, the scenery is interesting, from the running trails to the fields where the McFarland runners pick crops.\n\nOne real turnoff was when, repeatedly, opposing runners were shown talking smack before the start of races, and opposing coaches made snarky comments about the McFarland team. I&apos;ve coached youth sports for many years and am accustomed to seeing much better sportsmanship than that. The movie makers apparently needed to set up cartoonish villains so that the audience would root even harder for the good guys.\n\nAnother clunker came at the first race, the &quot;Palo Alto Invitational.&quot; The race director was surprised when McFarland showed up - but if it was an &quot;invitational,&quot; then either they&apos;d been invited (so he shouldn&apos;t have been surprised) or they hadn&apos;t been (in which case they had no business going to the race).\n\nThis was a generally pleasant two hours, and it was good to know that the basic heartwarming events took place in real life. Could have been better (or at least less bad in some parts), but it was OK. I recommend you find the story &quot;Running for Their Lives&quot; by Gary Smith, the captivating real-life tale of Jim White and McFarland (told as only the brilliant Smith could).",

      "reviewBody": "The pair to compartmentalize their personal and work lives to some extent, but all hope of keeping work and love separate goes wrong when she receives a promotion he thought he was going to get. This is not the erotic thriller Netflix&apos;s algorithm so desperately would like it to be. There is sex, yes, and a psychological duel, but not so much perverse desire. It&apos;s ultimately an ugly film. Fair Play is about the sort of guy a lot of women are uncomfortably familiar with - the one who&apos;s perfect until he&apos;s not, who&apos;s an ally as long as he stays in power. It&apos;s about the sort of woman other women dread to become, the one who realises her own power is illusory only when it&apos;s far too late. Both the lead actors deliver good performances but in my opinion you don&apos;t know where the whole story is going..",

      "reviewBody": "Another critic discussing this film accurately mentioned &quot;being shamefully ignored&quot; as an injustice this 1985 William-Friedkin masterpiece suffered upon its release. And it was not only the critics who failed to notice its worth. For some reason, the public stayed away in droves as well, this as myself and my friend were practically organizing tours to the theater, introducing people to the film who, weened on &quot;48 Hours&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and yet to experience the Abbott &amp; Costello hijinks of the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series, had little concept of what a below-the-belt, impeccably crafted cop movie could be. Or would turn into.\n\nThose who&apos;ve seen Friedkin&apos;s earlier genre entry &quot;The French Connection&quot; shouldn&apos;t be caught off guard by his often ruthless tactics here, as he&apos;s back in the familiar territory of cops and criminals.  Nor should those who survived his muscular &quot;Sorcerer&quot;--another unsung hero of an action piece--be unprepared for the director&apos;s inability to hide the more challenging (and dreadful) sides of male conflict. Even the disturbing &quot;Cruising&quot;, where no attempts were made by the film to explain its ugly corkscrew of a story, all the while summoning an atmosphere thick with dread, still suspenseful, but full of plot holes conveniently filled with leather jackets and the scariest Village-People-on-PCP-soundtrack to date, is just another Friedkin descent into Hell. The details always more than part of a whole.\n\nIt may show the surface of a genre flick, but beneath the pulsing Wang Chung soundtrack and 80s-reflective duds (no Members Only jackets appear, luckily) there is as lean and mean and taut a suspense thriller as even Don Siegel could deliver in his prime. And with an outstanding, hyper-realistic cast of then unknowns--including Chicago theater alumni  William Pederson, pre-&quot;CSI&quot; and with even more cock to his walk, swaggering through his pursuit of a damaged counterfeiter, Willem Dafoe--the screws tighten with each and every action sequence, climaxing the building mayhem with a cathartic, freeway massacre of automotive chaos on the same scale as a &quot;Mad Max&quot; movie.\n\nThe characters ar caustic, the betrayals extremely violent, the music pounding, the ending, in particular, is a departure from the Gerald Petievich novel, the author, himself, a retired U.S. Treasury agent writing an even bleaker resolution to the problem of two unstable detectives at odds with each other, losing their sanity, and finding no comfort in their escalating criminal misbehavior. &quot;To Live And Die In LA&quot; marks a significant and welcome departure within such an oversaturated genre, the buddy cop movie. It refuses to soften its blows or coddle its audience, showing instead dangerous, volatile situations being taken serious. Brutally serious.\n\nNonetheless, for all its nihilistic tone, captured in parched images of a city populated by thugs, thieves, and sociopathic criminals, &quot;To Live And Die In LA&quot; is like a breath of fresh smog."

      "reviewBody": "A Solid Refreshing Script with Brilliant direction, Hugh jackman gave An Award-winning performance. My rating 8/10.\n\nBad Education, movie Based on a true story of America&apos;s largest school theft, a scandal of 11 million dollars from Roslyn school district. Prime suspects Frank Tassone, Pam Gluckin played by Hugh jackman and Allision Gluckin respectively. Frank Tassone, superintendent of Roslyn district schools who genuinely cares about students, does what&apos;s best for their students, remembers everyone&apos;s name, and overly concerned about his physical appearance. Pam Glukin is a hardworking, trusted individual. Everything goes smoothly until a student investigates for funds for her school article.\n\nBad Education is absolutely captivating, for some the first 30 min might seem a little boring, in fact, nothing happens, we don&apos;t know what&apos;s happening it just builds characters and sets environment, after that movie jumps, instantly hooks until the end of the movie, we see another side of the characters, unfolding the story through student journalist. The screenplay how of the story unravels interestingly wrote by Mike Makowsky. After seeing the movie Surprised to know this is an only second directorial film by Cory Finley, did a good job.\n\nHugh jackman Easily the best part of the movie, with his charisma, deep acting, facial expressions, as the movie progresses he changes shades of character really given a masterclass acting. Not only in the movie in real Hugh jackman worked as a teacher, and also remembers his student&apos;s name, as we all know how nice is this guy. For me, this is the best acting of Hugh after Les Miserables ( 2012), Prisoners (2013). Alison Janney&apos;s performance was amazing.\n\nVerdict - A character study of how these two individuals who are reasonably good people, did a bad thing and broke the trust of people brilliantly written and directed. Terrific performance By Hugh Jackman.\n\nBad Education (2020), Drama/biography/thriller Directed By Cory Finley, screenplay - Mike Makowsky, he was in middle school in the Roslyn school district during this true scandal took place. Cast - Hugh jackman, Alison Janney, Geraldine Viswanathan.\n\n Thanks for reading🙃",

With its strong performances, atmospheric cinematography, and a compelling blend of genres, the movie stands out as a notable entry in the post-apocalyptic and horror genres. If you enjoy character-driven stories set in dystopian settings, &quot;Stake Land&quot; is definitely worth a watch.\n\nThe film&apos;s atmosphere is bleak and haunting, capturing a sense of desolation and hopelessness. The cinematography effectively captures the desolate landscapes, abandoned towns, and darkened forests, further enhancing the post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The sparse use of music and sound design contributes to the overall sense of unease, creating a tense and foreboding ambiance throughout the film.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is an efficient thriller from Spain.  It deals with the popular urban legend of &quot;snuff&quot; films (films which depict a real-life murder committed purely for the sake of the film).\n\nThe plot involves a young film student Angela (Ana Terrant) who is doing a thesis on cinematic violence.  To research her thesis she seeks out the most extreme violence films she can find and accidentally stumbles upon a snuff film depicting the torture and murder of a fellow student from her university.  She soon starts investigating the film.\n\nThe film is well-made and well-acted with several effective scares and twists.  It&apos;s main message is that the people who watch violent films are in some way accomplices to the violent acts that they watch.  This is an old point that has been made several times before.  It also deals with the attraction of the forbidden.  For example, in the opening scene, Angela goes to see a dead body on a railway track, partly because she has been told not to.  Just when she, and the audience, are about to see the body she is stopped.  In another scene, Angela is looking away from the snuff film but takes a quick look when she is told not to."

Along with black holes, quarks, and the meaning of life, the greatest mystery of the universe is why Martin Lawrence has a career: The guy is not only not funny, but manages to be truly pitiable -- shucking and jiving like an nineteenth century minstrel. I&apos;m surprised the NAACP doesn&apos;t protest his performances, or this movie for that matter.\n\n It&apos;s hard to find a redeeming virtue in this movie -- the script seems to have been lost by all indications, the &quot;acting&quot;, even using the word in quotation marks gives too much credit, is lousy; and the sets look like they were worked up in a high school basement for a student production.\n\n I&apos;m not sure what audience the makers were going for; Martin Lawrence is often marketed to black audiences, but in this movie he and the love interest are the only blacks in the movie.  Of course all the whites are depicted as complete idiots, but Lawrence out-idiots them all.\n\n Another example of Hollywood&apos;s contempt for the movie going public.  They think they can trowel out any sort of bilge and make money.  Let&apos;s hope they wake up soon, and if they&apos;re  going to give us silly movies, make them funny."

Remi is artistic. He draws and plays the oboe. Leo is athletic. He plays ice hockey. They have fun together and have frequent sleepovers. When they are put in the same class at school, their closeness is noticed by their fellow pubescent classmates, who ask them if they&apos;re &quot;a couple.&quot; And thus begins a dramatic change in the boys&apos; friendship. This is a very sensitive film with fine naturalistic performances by a cast that makes it seem at times that we&apos;re watching a documentary. Especially impressive are child actor Eden Dambrine as Leo and Emile Dequenne as Remi&apos;s mother. It&apos;s an odd film in that a lot of details, as far as the events are concerned, are missing. There are a lot of unanswered questions. But the emotions are vivid and extremely detailed. This is a sad yet provocative film that is well worth seeing.",

      "name": "A quite watchable remake, although it&apos;s a far cry from the original",
      "reviewBody": "This English-language remake of the excellent DISTRICT 13 was once again made by the French, albeit shot in Canada this time around. It&apos;s pretty much a scene-for-scene remake of the original, although inevitably not as good for reasons which we shall come to. It&apos;s only as the running time goes on that crucial differences to the original come to light and unfortunately they&apos;re not improvements.\n\nFirst, let&apos;s get the good stuff listed. This is a short, snappy, action thriller, with plenty of shoot-outs and fight scenes to recommend it. The framing is often good and there&apos;s a fine sense of setting in the grubby, run-down locations. One of the highlights is the return of David Belle, playing the same character as he did in the original; it&apos;s just an annoyance that they decided to dub him rather than have him use his French accented English.\n\nPaul Walker is an odd but obvious choice for Cyril Raffaelli&apos;s character in the original, but he&apos;s no martial artist so the martial arts fights have been replaced by fist fights and a greater emphasis on car chases. Catalina Denis and Ayisha Issa are the requisite scantily-clad women who hang around to show off their bodies and little more is required of them than that.\n\nThe problems are slight at first but begin to mount up as the narrative progresses. First off, the editing is horrendous. The early Parkour scenes are ruined by the refusal to shoot the stunts in single, fluid takes; there&apos;s always a dodgy edit halfway through, cutting to a different angle and lessening the impact. Sometimes one of Belle&apos;s jumps has three or four edits in it which ruins the whole flow of the thing. BRICK MANSIONS does a lot right, but it gets this crucial editing oh so wrong. I remember in the old days of Jackie Chan&apos;s 1980s movies that they sometimes wanted to capture a stunt from different angles, so they would just replay it, which was a much better way of doing it.\n\nThe second problem is RZA, playing the drug dealer villain of the piece. RZA is one of those guys who really loves himself and the film-makers seem to love him too, so there&apos;s an unbelievable twist at the end which has to be seen to be believed. The ending is frankly laughable in this respect, and a far cry from the power of the original movie. It&apos;s the epitome of sanitised, PG-13 entertainment, and I could cry. At least the rest of the film is in the right spirit, so it&apos;s only the ending where it falls apart.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen this movie before; it&apos;s called Ad Astra. Ambitious, but emotionally absent(and inconsiderate, I guess) husband leaves perfect wife behind to go on vital space mission. In both movies, the man is plagued by memories of a deeply flawed father, leaving them emotionally scarred and unable to reciprocate their perfect wives&apos; love.\n\nWhile in Ad Astra, Brad Pitt&apos;s character discovers his shortcomings pieces at a time: though memory, experience, and various encounters - here, they forgo all nuance. We simply have a spider companion who directly and endlessly tells Adam Sandler what an ass he is to his wife. But both movies share one emotional theme: fathers suck and their sons are not much better. Relationships are all about men needing to open up more. This is not so bad by itself. But I&apos;ve seen this in so many movies and TV shows by now it&apos;s starting to get tiresome. With all the fancy camera-work, heavy performances, and ambient music, this story still just beats you over the head with it&apos;s message without offering anything other than an overused cliché.\n\nOther movies in the past have a truly more nuanced approach. Try Solaris(either version), for example. I appreciate the production of this film, really. It&apos;s just that this come off as a feminist fantasy rather than good science fiction.",

      "reviewBody": "Roman Polanski again explores the depths of the human psyche in Bitter Moon, a magnificent epic tale of obsessive lust and the oh-so-familiar winding course of a passionate romance gone sour.\n\nBitter Moon centers around a familiar Polanski theme, that we are capable of being both torturer and victim, and usually both simultaneously.  For anyone who doubts the validity of much of the past century of French intellectual thought, from the likes of Andre Gide, Foucault, and others, see this movie. For anyone who has been in a painful twisted relationship, see this movie. You will understand it.  Some of it might be hard to stomach but that is the nature of truly great filmmaking.\n\nA beautifully crafted movie, almost lyrical at times, Bitter moon is set in contemporary Paris but is told in a series of long complex flashbacks superbly narrated by Oscar (a terrific Peter Coyote) to Nigel (Hugh Grant as the usual British prat), both passengers on a  cruise ship to India.  Nigel and his wife Fiona, played by Kirsten Scott-Thomas, are on a holiday to enliven a stable but stale marriage.  The couples become embroiled through the lurid tale of Oscar and Mimi&apos;s (Emmanuelle Seigner) love affair. Emmanuelle, Polanski&apos;s real-life wife, is superb and her incredible performance takes her from sumptuous beauty to complete wreck, a performance that deserves far more praise than was received.  The lack of attention to her performance in this movie is no doubt due to the notoriety in the puritanical American press of her husband.\n\nAs a whole, Bitter Moon may not be Polanski&apos;s best film but some periods of the movie represent his very best work.  Throughout, limits are pushed to the brink of tastelessness but Polanski masterfully pulls back just in time. The direction is complex and highly sophisticated and the movie arouses a range of emotions from dread to empathy to disgust to hilarity.  The story line is far too complicated to synopsize appropriately in this review. Bitter moon is a great film, one of this reviewer&apos;s top 10 for the 1990s. Another must see!  A word of caution, however, Bitter Moon is not a good date movie."

Leonard had a great disappointment with his fiancée and after a psychological treatment, he is not stable. During the night, he meets Sandra Cohen (Vinessa Shaw) in a dinner party promoted by his family to the family of Michael Cohen (Bob Ari), who wants a partnership with his father in his dry cleaning business. Later Leonard meets his new neighbor Michelle Rausch (Gwyneth Paltrow) and he immediately feels attracted to her. Leonard and Sandra have a love affair with each other, and Sandra feels in love with him. But Leonard is in love with Michelle that is in love with her married lover Ronald Blatt (Elias Koteas) that does not leave his wife and children to stay with her. How will this quartet of unrequited loves end?\n\n&quot;Two Lovers&quot; is a pleasant romance slightly inspired in the novel &quot;White Night&quot; by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Joaquin Phoenix and Gwyneth Paltrow have great chemistry and magnificent performances and are the reason why &quot;Two Lovers&quot; works so well. The supporting cast with Isabella Rossellini and Vinessa Shaw among others great actors and actresses in another plus in this film. It is impressive how time goes by and now Isabella Rossellini performs the mother of Joaquin Phoenix´s character. The plot does not have any plot point or surprising development and indeed it is quite predictable, but &quot;Two Lovers&quot; is worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Amantes&quot; (&quot;Lovers&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "I knew for the trailer that this film was going to be a bit generic but I suppose I was hoping it wouldn&apos;t be that generic. As someone who grew up on Indiana Jones, loves Uncharted and has a soft spot for National Treasure this felt very familiar but not in a knowing way because there&apos;s nothing this movie does with the established formula that feels remotely unique. Guy Ritchie doesn&apos;t bring any of his signature energy to this movie and it&apos;s starting to feel like his tendency to put out as many films as possible over the last few years is starting to come back to bite him. Fountain of Youth just feels flat in every way and it ends up feeling like something made for streaming. John Krasinski&apos;s a badass and Natalie Portman is charming but it kind of just feels like the script is trying too hard to make them overly likeable and it actually felt a bit annoying after a while. The film starts out a quick pace but starts to drag on in the second half and the climax in particular was a bit of a slog to get through. There&apos;s a lot of talented people involved in this movie but I&apos;m not really sure what drew them to it in the first place. It just oozes mediocrity and as someone who&apos;s a big Guy Ritchie fan I&apos;d like to see him get a bit more selective with his projects.",

It starts off with a family, an ice cream van and an incredibly creepy house. Looked to me like it could be a Rob Zombie movie, and funnily enough within minutes one of the characters remarks that the house looks like it could belong to Mr Z! Now I am a fan of Rob Z but Incident was more polished than any of his movies. If found Incident to be visually superb, the creepy house in question, crammed with dolls, is amazing. The film is genuinely frightening with some good jump scares. It&apos;s brutal, twisted and dark. There are some great twists and the plot never slows down, it held my attention throughout. Camera work, musical score and acting are all excellent. The only two things that I didn&apos;t like was the use of some CGI and, without giving away spoilers, I felt that the end was a bit too easy and slightly unsatisfying. After such a thrilling ride I felt that it could have been better. Overall, another class effort from Monsieur Laugier. I shall look forward to watching this again, best film that I have seen so far this year.",

      "reviewBody": "Johnny, Sarah and their young daughters Christy and Ariel move to New York from Ireland. With barely any money they find an apartment in a run-down building that is overrun with drug addicts. Johnny, an actor, struggles to get a role and the family eke out an existence. Also hanging over them is the death of their son, Frankie. Then one day the little girls meet and befriend the mysterious, solitary neighbour, Mateo.\n\nWritten and directed by Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot, In The Name Of The Father), the movie is a bitter-sweet experience. The trials and tribulations of an immigrant family struggling to make ends meet, mixed with the recent tragedy in their history and the complexity of the Mateo situation make for an emotional journey. The daughters also provide a sweet, innocent perspective to proceedings.\n\nYet it all feels underdone. The family&apos;s situation is not as grittily shown as we imagine it should be. The basic summary of this movie reminded me of another Irish movie, Angela&apos;s Ashes, and that was a harrowing journey, where no positive outcomes are assured, making for an incredibly interesting and engaging experience. This movie is too neat and non-confrontational to feel like there are any really negative plot developments ahead.\n\nIn addition, certain key aspects are not developed very well. We never really get to know Mateo well enough to feel totally engaged by his character. Even the Frankie story, possibly the most emotional aspect to the movie, feels it is in there to demand our emotional energy rather than earn it, and the conclusion to that feels a bit clumsy.\n\nCan&apos;t fault the performances though. Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton put in solid performances as Johnny and Sarah, as does Djimon Hounsou as Mateo and Sarah and Emma Bolger steal the show as Christy and Ariel.\n\nOverall: an interesting, emotional movie but far from perfect.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t use the word &quot;masterpiece&quot; often when reviewing a film but for &quot;Whale Rider,&quot; it&apos;s an inadequate accolade. This is one of the most moving, beautiful and powerful films I have seen in years.\n\nScreenplay author and director Niki Caro faithfully translated Witi Ihimaera&apos;s novel of the same name, a poignant and sometimes sad but ultimately uplifting story of New Zealand Maoris seeking, with the leadership of a difficult, stubborn and often harsh elder to sustain their peoples&apos; values and customs.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand are both encountering, in politics and in culture (and often the two are inextricably linked), their shared heritage of white oppression of native peoples. Much of this history is unknown to Americans and Europeans who view Australia through a bird&apos;s eye picture of the Sydney Opera House and New Zealand with even fewer associational icons.\n\nRecently, &quot;Rabbitproof Fence&quot; painfully depicted the policy of Australia to force lighter skin aborigines into &quot;schools&quot; where they would be nurtured to become &quot;semi-whites&quot; and then married to those of similar skin tone. The object was to bleach the blackness out of Australia and the horrors of this incarnation of cultural and anthropological genocide are on full display in that film.\n\n&quot;Whale Rider&quot; takes a different and, in the end, perhaps a more powerful approach. There are virtually no whites in the film and only children&apos;s t-shirts and some music blasting from a boombox suggests the encroaching force of the controlling majority.\n\nThe cast is unknown to Americans and their names can be found on the IMDb homepage for the film. The lead actress, however, must be named. In the role of &quot;Pai,&quot; a young girl whose mother dies at her birth along with her twin brother, is the extraordinary Keisha Castle-Hughes. She imbues every scene with a commanding and inviting vitality. Hers is an Academy Award (and any other major award) performance.\n\nPai&apos;s father left New Zealand for Europe, there to create and sell Maori crafts. She lives with her grandmother and grandfather, the latter some sort of unelected chieftain of the oceanside community. Bitter that no male heir will succeed him and alternately cruel and loving to his reluctantly acknowledged granddaughter, Koro starts a school to supplement the young boys&apos; secular education with inculcation of the ways of the Maori. Pai wishes to join as an equal and is firmly, indeed harshly rebuffed at every turn.\n\nIf the Maori language has the phrase &quot;You go, girl!,&quot; then it be directed towards the indefatigable but not arrogant Pai. It would have been easy to make her the kind of thoughtless rebel that nature often programs teenagers to be. The depth of her character resides in her simultaneous quest for equality and her understanding of her grandfather&apos;s unyielding attachment to patriarchal values. Pai&apos;s close relationship with her grandmother, a woman living a life universally recognizable to Americans, provides warmth and support and do some of her other relationships.\n\nThe story unfolds seamlessly with Maori music and rituals bridging the spoken dialogue (mostly in English, some in Maori with subtitles).\n\nPartly a straight tale, partly a gripping mystical fable, &quot;Whale Rider&quot; never becomes saccharine.\n\nThe music and Maori songs complement but do not compete with the dialogue, a welcome change from many movies today. The land and the ocean are rawly gorgeous.\n\nAs in Australia, relations today between New Zealand&apos;s indigenous people and the descendants of their vanquishers are sometimes tense. There are open wounds from continuing political collisions over land and culture. The Maoris are not a monolith and internal dissension is active. Serious attempts to sustain Maori values and culture in the face of assimilative pressures meet with varied degrees of success (in Koro&apos;s Maori school the kids wear t-shirts with rock themes and one has a shirt advertising an upstate New York resort area if I saw correctly). New Zealand&apos;s most internationally renowned Maori is the opera diva Kiri te Kanawa who is now dedicated to Maori cultural restoration projects. &quot;Whale Rider&quot; can only give a boost to such efforts which, as this film shows, makes not only New Zealand but the world richer.\n\nThis is a film I will acquire on DVD as soon as it is available.\n\n10/10.",

You are better off seeing this film &quot;cold&quot; knowing neither the plot nor the players. It does tend to get a bit goarey towards the end, but not without reason. A well written, superbly acted (especially by the two leads) and expertly directed work that makes you continue to believe that cinema can still be political and make important points without hitting you over the head with a blunt instrument. My only minor crib would be the accents which can be difficult to decipher or in Tatou&apos;s case slightly off (her character is supposed to be Turkish but the accent is more Eastern European)."

We loved the other 2 movies and had to finish the trilogy! This one could be titled Santa gets a midlife crisis--the plot is based on Scott&apos;s frustration over having so many responsibilities and not enough time with his family. There are some disappointments; of course, Bernard isn&apos;t in it and we all love him; just one line with no explanation tells us he must be gone. Also, Santa doesn&apos;t seem himself; yes, he&apos;s frustrated, but you don&apos;t see the excitement he had before. And,the plot gets resolved so close to the ending that you still haven&apos;t processed it, and the credits are rolling! But if you liked the other movies, go see this one; it&apos;s not as action packed, it&apos;s a little sappy, but it&apos;s clean fun and you&apos;ll laugh if you let yourself! \n\nJust remember that it&apos;s not Shakespeare, it&apos;s just a Christmas movie. Go and have some fun! Enjoy the Canada subplot, eh?"

      "reviewBody": "The first point that bears emphasis about the 1998 film adaptation of Victor Hugo&apos;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot; is that it is highly abridged. Even more abridged than abridged versions of the novel and even more abridged than the story used for the popular musical. Characters such as Éponine and Gavroche are absent from this adaptation. This will offend those looking for a closer adaptation of Hugo&apos;s novel, but it does not bother me that this film focuses on the story of Valjean, Javert, Fantine, Cosette and Marius. The basic story for those unfamiliar with it, takes place in 19th century France and follows a poor thief, Jean Valjean, who is relentlessly pursued by Inspector Javert, even after reforming his ways.\n\nLiam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush are excellent as the reformed and generous ex-convict and his relentless pursuer. The rest of the performances are commendable as well, particularly from Uma Thurman as Fantine, Claire Danes as Cosette and Hans Matheson as Marius. Claire Danes, in addition to giving a solid performance, seems to fit well with the iconic image of Cosette that has come to represent musical productions of the story.\n\nVisually this film is impressive as well with sweeping representations of Paris, Vigo and other locations and appropriate costumes. Basil Poledouris&apos; score was also fitting for the story. The story, though abridged, still effectively gives us the touching tale of the plight of the poor in France, a reformed and ceaselessly generous convict, an overzealous inspector and those around them. I always enjoyed the clash of ideals and cat and mouse game between a reformed criminal and a man who clings to the ideal that no criminal can ever be reformed. This version of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; is recommended for those that are not uncomfortable with heavy abridgements to Hugo&apos;s classic novel.",

      "reviewBody": "As with Mr Nice Guy,this Jackie Chan vehicle is basically a Hong Kong production filmed in English with mostly western actors. It&apos;s actually an odd Chan film in some respects. For a start,the first third of the film hardly seems like a Chan film at all,apart from a few comic bits of business {Chan chased up a tree by a lion}which are mostly cut from the US version anyway. Even in shortened form,and with some good desert photography,the whole &apos;Chan finds himself among desert tribesmen&apos; subplot seems an unnecessarily laborious way of getting into the amnesia story that becomes the main thrust of the story.\n\nNevertheless,after this the film becomes solid Chan fare with the same fast pacing of Mr Nice Guy. There&apos;s a great car chase and while the fights are quite short {as with most recent Chan films,he spends a lot of time running away from opponents},it&apos;s good to see Chan bashed about a bit-he looks very vulnerable in this film. Of course the acting is weak and some of the dialogue laughable {I&apos;m not sure I agree with the reviewer here who says it was intentionally comic,but opinions differ!},while the intrigue of the amnesia/spy plot just becomes an excuse for the usual chasing around. However,one can almost forgive all this when the climax features a great fight on top of a skyscraper followed quite simply one of the most awesome and downright foolhardy stunts Chan has done. I won&apos;t describe it in detail,just see for yourself! You WILL be amazed.\n\nThere is a sense with Who Am I that the filmmakers attempted to tell a fairly complex story and then realised they were making a Jackie Chan movie and changed it accordingly,leaving a fair bit of confusion. Interestingly,Chan&apos;s original cut was around 3 hours long,and maybe that made more sense and balanced the two elements of the film better. Still,there&apos;s a lot of fun to be had here nevertherless. And just listen to Chan rap the part English,part Chinese theme song during the end credits."

      "reviewBody": "This adaptation of Janet Evanivich&apos;s book is well done and a lot of fun. Katherine Heigl is excellent in the role of Stephanie Plum. Apparently the author considered Katherine perfect for this role after seeing her in another movie. I&apos;m so glad it was directed by a woman and combines the chick flick aspect with the mystery/bounty hunter storyline. Women&apos;s dates will be well rewarded, by Heigl&apos;s charm and beauty, for being along for the ride.\n\nHeigl proves again what she showed in her television work in Grey&apos;s Anatomy and Roswell, that she&apos;s an excellent and versatile actress. She displays the vulnerability combined with toughness and a certain likable gullibility that are exactly as the book portrays the main character.\n\nThe movie is only 91 minutes long. Since the book and the movie depend more on the fun of getting to know the characters, including the first-person narrator, Stephanie Plum, it would have been so easy, and would have made it much better IMO, to include more scenes with the family, especially Grandma Mazur (Debbie Reynolds!), and with Lula (Sherri Shepherd is also wonderful). As it is, the &quot;action&quot; plot takes over in the second half, and it left me wishing for more of the fun character interactions.\n\nPlum, Morelli and Ranger are really well portrayed and quite a lot like I imagined them while reading the book. This is light entertainment with a few quirks and unpredictable points of view, like the book, and overall a very enjoyable hour and a half.",

      "reviewBody": "Rising like a phoenix from the ashes, D2 spreads its wings and soars to new heights of artistic merit.  D2 is the rarest of sequels, a sequel that is truly better than the original.  All of the jagged edges in the original film&apos;s plot have been streamlined, and the new ground being broken, (Self-Doubt, Conquering your fears, Sexual Identity) fit in seamlessly, giving this film a more robust feel, similar to that of Chunky Soup.  Emilio Estevez (In his star-making role) plays coach Bombay with a smoldering fury that makes it very clear that he is Martin Sheen&apos;s favorite son.  The rest of the cast is equally brilliant, especially the ducks themselves, whose performances are so real, you cant help believing that they are truly kids.  The direction is bold yet beautiful, and instantly recalls that of the early german surrealists.  The electronic score by Goblin is eerily effective in creating suspense in both the game and locker room scenes, and lets the viewer know that this isnt a game anymore, and that national pride is on the line.  A masterpiece of baroque visuals and dry wit, D2 is a most worthy rental upon your next excursion to the video store."

      "reviewBody": "I hadn&apos;t even heard about this 2019 movie titled &quot;Synchronic&quot; before now in 2021, as I had the chance to sit down and watch it. I read the synopsis for the movie and it sounded like it could be something worthwhile watching. So I gave the movie a chance.\n\nAnd yeah, &quot;Synchronic&quot; definitely was watchable, but it wasn&apos;t an impressive movie. The storyline was just way too generic and predictable. It felt like writer Justin Benson was opting for the easiest way for constructing a storyline for the movie. Everything was just so linear and running on auto-pilot. So I can&apos;t really claim to have been blown away by the storyline told in &quot;Synchronic&quot;.\n\nActually I would say that the movie&apos;s directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead set up a whole lot of things that had potential, but ultimately they failed to bring them to fruition, and it just felt half-hearted. There definitely was potential to be found in the movie, but it was just wasted as nothing felt thoroughly explored, explained or exposed.\n\nThe acting in the movie was good, but the actors and actresses just didn&apos;t have an overwhelming amount of material to work with, so it felt like it was semi-hindered performances.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Synchronic&quot; lands on a very bland and mediocre five out of ten stars. The movie is good enough for a single viewing, if you enjoy linear sci-fi movies. But the contents of the storyline just were far too feeble to support more than a single viewing. &quot;Synchronic&quot; came and went without leaving much of any ripples in the fabric of time and space.",

It seems to me that, precisely because of Dugan&apos;s lack of control, these two guys gave free rein to all of their improvisational instincts and they save the film from being a complete mess. They are sensational. Jack Black&apos;s constant mimicing of Neil Diamond&apos;s habit of singing &quot;come on now yaaahaaa&quot; when he does Holly Holy is insidious and sticks in your head long after the film has finished.\n\nAmanda Peet and Amanda Detmer are sex on legs here. Their parts are badly written but who cares when they look this good! Even Neil Diamond shows he is a trouper by showing up for a cameo in a film that, essentially, pokes gentle fun at how uncool his stage persona is perceived to be.\n\nThis is just great ...9/10"

      "reviewBody": "As others have commented, this is certainly light entertainment, not heavy on elaborate plot lines. I actually saw this movie today on a flight from Japan, and found it delightful. It certainly is a film that was pitched to a French Audience, tossing in simplified bits of Japanese pop culture (Witness: I have never encountered so many Japanese that could speak French, as in this movie). Nevertheless this is what I liked about the movie:\n\n 1. The interplay between Fiorentino (Jean Reno) and his sidekick Momo (Michel Muller) was consistently humorous throughout, with Muller delivering the punchline, and nearly upstaging Reno throughout. My favorite scene is when Fiorentino is eating generous gobs of Wasabi (hence the name of the film), and Momo, not wanting to be outdone by his mentor, nearly gags to death on the stuff. I was laughing out loud -- maybe because it reminds me too vividly of the first time I ever ate sushi, and nearly died doing the same thing as Momo!!\n\n2. Ryoko Hirosue, who plays Yumi, the previously unknown daughter to Fiorentini, is one of the current hot young faces in Japan, and has appeared in many TV dramas and movies. She certainly provides all the eye candy I could ever wish for in this film. But I must admit a certain new found-respect for her acting abilities, as she pulled off her lines in French flawlessly, while maintaining her trademark cuteness and capturing the carefree attitude of today&apos;s Japanese youth. She provided a foil of a different sort for Reno, her bright colors (pink hair, pink everything) offering a striking contrast to Reno&apos;s darker, demure look.\n\n The Yakuza were portrayed as mindless goons in this film, and there are certainly better films out there if you want to know more about Yakuza, but it appeared that they played their role, which was to showcase Reno&apos;s machismo, in a humorous way, something along the lines of Jackie Chan films -- they are more like props in the film than anything else.\n\n All in all, I was entertained by this film, which is all I was looking for during my 11 hours crossing the Pacific."

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Beach Boys fans may struggle a bit with this one since the light-hearted, airy feel to the &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot; music of the band is mostly absent. Instead, director Bill Pohlad pulls back the curtain on the emotional and mental struggles of visionary songwriter Brian Wilson  the band&apos;s creative force.\n\nIn an unusual artistic approach, Paul Dano plays Brian from the 1960&apos;s period that resulted in the revolutionary Pet Sounds album and the ongoing battle with his domineering father; while John Cusack plays Brian from the late 1980&apos;s - his most creatively bankrupt period and the subsequent debilitating influence of quackster psychologist Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti).\n\nThe two periods are blended together as we (and Brian) bounce back and forth between the struggle of a budding musical genius working to release the sounds in his head, and a middle aged man so heavily medicated that speaking, eating and even getting out of bed are such overwhelming obstacles that music rarely registers. It&apos;s during the latter period that Brian is truly at the mercy of Dr. Eugene Landy. Giamatti sports a floppy wig and proceeds to rage at Brian while trying to charm Melinda (Elizabeth Banks), Brian&apos;s new romantic interest. Knowing this disgusting period was part of Brian&apos;s life only adds to the anger and frustration we feel  not just as fans, but as human beings.\n\nWhat sets this biopic apart is actually the performance of Dano and the peek inside the process of Brian&apos;s genius. Watching Brian work the musicians and mold the music on the fly is breath-taking, even though we see the challenges of his early mental issues. It&apos;s a joy to see a tribute to the studio session players known as &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;  themselves the subject of a recent stellar documentary. It&apos;s during this period that the Wilson brothers&apos; father (played by Bill Camp) constantly derides Brian and his &quot;new&quot; music. There is also some insight into the Brian vs Mike Love battles – Brian exploring his creative music, while Mike just wants to keep cashing in with their expected &quot;fun&quot; style.\n\nSome may find the two-headed approach to be distracting, but it drives home the point of what a different man he was in comparing the mid-1960&apos;s to the late 1980&apos;s. Mostly, I found the 1960&apos;s portion to be an insight into what we hear from so many geniuses, regardless of their specialty. Brian says it&apos;s like &quot;Someone is inside me. Not me.&quot; His struggles are non-relatable to others – even his brothers, and especially his dad. What is mostly a look at the darkness behind the &quot;sunny&quot; music, does come with real life redemption courtesy of Melinda&apos;s strength  and witnessed in the video shown over the closing credits.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Tigerland&quot; takes place in the autumn of 1971, when the Army was intent on turning young men into fighting units. One of the guys stationed at Fort Polk is the sensitive Paxton (Matthew Davis), who has literary aspirations. He meets a headstrong character named Bozz (Colin Farrell), who&apos;s a born rebel; Bozz has charisma to burn and genuine leadership abilities, but he&apos;s also the type to tend to shun responsibility. However, Bozz ends up becoming the guide for a troublesome platoon, and his men must rely on him to get through their rigorous training. The title location is a hellish training ground that will be their last stop before they are actually shipped off to Vietnam.\n\nDirector Joel Schumacher gets a fair amount of flak for some of his films, especially his two entries in the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise, but proof that he WAS a highly capable filmmaker can be shown with this arresting little drama. It boasts no big stars of the time, but does feature some top character actors, and some stars-to-be (Michael Shannon also turns up briefly, showing the men the finer points of torturing the enemy). Tension and conflict arise from the presence of the unstable Wilson (Shea Whigham), who ends up with a real chip on his shoulder when it comes to Bozz. Also among the cast are other familiar faces like Cole Hauser, Clifton Collins Jr., Tom Guiry, and Nick Searcy. But it is Farrell, unsurprisingly, who gives &quot;Tigerland&quot; its principal value, playing a guy who may rock the boat, yet is not without some integrity, and the willingness to help out fellow soldiers who need the assistance.\n\n&quot;Tigerland&quot; showcases efficient, solid storytelling, and has some great atmosphere. It does indeed feel reasonably realistic, and it interestingly ends in a more low-key manner than viewers may expect. It features some tunes of the era on the soundtrack, but doesn&apos;t go overboard in trying to evoke the period. Nathan Larsons&apos; score is also used sparingly.\n\nThis one is definitely worth a viewing if you haven&apos;t already seen it.\n\nEight out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Terrence Howard plays a Memphis pimp who decides to give hardcore rapping a shot in this arresting, gritty drama. Howard plays DJay, who pimps girls out of his beat-up Chevy Nova. When he comes into the possession of an electronic keyboard, DJay plays around with it and finds he has a talent for writing and performing hard, violent lyrics.\n\nOn its face, this seems like a typical &quot;man rises from the ashes of his hardscrabble life to experience success and then watches it all crash down around him&quot; kind of movie. It&apos;s not a movie about suffering, success, and redemption, in other words. But it&apos;s not as predictable as it may seem at first blush, and Howard is not your typical actor, by any shot.\n\nDJay lives with his small stable of prostitutes in a tumble-down shack in the Memphis ghetto. As pimps go, he&apos;s not exactly Donald Trump. Some dance for an exotic club during the day and hook at night; some hook all day. But the money&apos;s not rolling in for DJay, who remains somewhat confident that he&apos;ll someday come out ahead. When he obtains the keyboard, inspiration strikes, and a chance encounter with an old classmate (Anthony Anderson) who&apos;s now a producer (of sorts) gives DJay the opportunity to jump out of the rotten life he&apos;s carved for himself.\n\nThis never feels like a typical rise-and-fall story, and that&apos;s thanks in no small part to the powerful performance by Howard, who&apos;s much better here than in the critically lauded (by some) Crash. Appearing with Howard in Crash was Ludicrous, who also has a big role in Hustle and Flow - hey, some rappers are very good actors, it turns out. Howard, aided by a crisp script from Craig Brewer, who also directed, never portrays DJay as simply a nice guy with some flaws, someone who&apos;s been handed a bad hand and is making the best of it. It&apos;s clear that DJay&apos;s made all of his own choices, and the situation he finds himself in - depending on hookers for his livelihood - is of his own doing.\n\nBut neither does the script show DJay as being entirely bad, either, as evidenced by some surprisingly tender, moving scenes between DJay and Key (Anderson) and DJay and Shug, his pregnant woman. These scenes don&apos;t come off as stilted or insincere, and that&apos;s thanks especially to Howard&apos;s strong performance. True, too, are the scenes in which DJay lays down a rap track in his home; you can feel the rage seeping through your television.\n\nThis movie might be a difficult sell to those who have trouble relating to the environment and atmosphere in which DJay operates. Undoubtedly those who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks will recognize aspects of their own lives, identifying strongly with one or more of the characters. But even those of us who have never lived in squalor, who&apos;ve generally had advantages that others do not, can appreciate the intense, gray world in which DJay and his associates live. Had this been a simple, typical biography of a musician from the mean streets, it wouldn&apos;t have had near the effectiveness, the passion of Hustle and Flow. The movie intrigues you, makes you want to know what happens to DJay, even when it&apos;s obvious he&apos;s a bit of a jerk. But because he&apos;s not a stupid man, his actions cannot be painted as simply good or simply bad. Howard, in particular, is well deserving of his critical accolades here.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a good war thriller with lots of action, impressive scenes and strong violence. A gripping and exciting story that keeps you tense throughout the entire film. Thriller with noisy action, shootouts, excessively shaky camera in some places and the special effects are quite brilliant. After sabotaging an Iranian nuclear reactor, Agent Tom Harris: Gerard Butler discovers that his identity has been revealed by a detained journalist, Nina Toussaint-White, and that the CIA&apos;s involvement in the destruction of the nuclear reactor has been made public. Gerard Butler plays Tom Harris, and his partner in the film, Oliver, is performed by Tom Harries. Harris has 30 hours to get to the airport in Kandahar, Afghanistan, along with his translator Mohammad &apos;Mo&apos; Doud: Navid Negahban. To fight the tumultuous escape, he reteams with mercurial and skilled operative Roman Chalmers: Travis Fimmel. The only thing more dangerous than the mission is escape!\n\nThis exciting film contains loudy action, full of suspense, tension, crossfire, chases and adrenaline. Financed by the head of the &quot;John Wick&quot; saga, as producer Alan Siegel explains: &quot;Not everything revolves around shooting and chases: the key is humanity&quot;, so the most dangerous thing is not the mission, it is the escape... and that is what the character of Gerard Butler, (The Pilot, 300), who is the true protagonist of this intricate and fast-paced action thriller, is very clear about.\n\nOperation Kandahar (2023) contains colorful cinematography by cameraman David Buckley filmed in several locations: Al-&apos;Ula, Saudi Arabia, and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As well as a moving and intriguing musical score by composer MacGregor. The film was competently directed by Ric Roman Waugh and filmed from December 2, 2021 to January 28, 2022. Roman has a long career as a stuntman and later became a prestigious writer and filmmaker. Waugh is a good director and writer, known for National Champions, Shot Caller (2017), Target: Washington D. C. or Angel Has Fallen (2019), Greenland (2020), In the Shadows and especially for his first big hit, Felon. He has been married to Tanya Ballinger, who often appears in his films. Rating: 6.5/10. It&apos;s worth seeing. Better than average. Essential and indispensable viewing for Gerard Butler fans and action thriller enthusiasts.",

      "reviewBody": "Single White Female is directed by Barbet Schroeder and adapted to screenplay by Don Roos from the novel &quot;SWF Seeks Same&quot; written by John Lutz. It stars Bridget Fonda, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Steven Weber, Peter Friedman and Stephen Tobolowsky. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Luciano Tovoli.\n\nWhen it&apos;s revealed that her partner Sam (Weber) has been cheating on her with his ex-wife, Allie Jones (Fonda) kicks him out of the apartment and advertises for a female roommate. She chooses Hedra Carlson (Leigh), who on the surface seems to be the perfect roommate. Smoothly helping Allie through her crisis, a real friendship is formed, but it&apos;s not long before Hedra starts to exhibit some dark behaviour patterns..\n\nThe early 90s saw the &quot;Woman from Hell&quot; back in vogue in mainstream cinema. After the success and publicity of Fatal Attraction (1987), there was a period where you feel that sensible film makers wisely chose to let that particular film disappear from the film lovers memory banks. As it happens, they must have collectively chose 5 years as the cooling off period. For 1992 saw a wave of mad female on the loose pictures released. Led by the publicity gobbling Basic Instinct, films such as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Single White Female put bums on cinema seats and reopened the &quot;Mad Bitch&quot; sub-genre. Of the three, Single White Female grossed the least, which is strange since it&apos;s a better movie than the other two.\n\nSchroeder&apos;s (Barfly/Reversal of Fortune) movie isn&apos;t a complete success, there&apos;s not enough development of the main characters and there&apos;s some unintentionally funny moments. But when it&apos;s good it&apos;s real good. Reeling off a number of memorable and often chilling scenes, film is further boosted by the psychological smarts in Roos&apos; (Boys on the Side) screenplay. It helps that Schroeder has a knack for pacing, too, where he neatly simmers the plot until the spill over for the big finale. No disappointment there either, a good combination of genre staples is enhanced in impact by some unexpected character developments, and there&apos;s moments of genuine suspense to lure the viewer to the edge of their seat. \n\nIt&apos;s also stylishly shot by Schroeder and Tovoli (Suspiria/Tenebrae). Allie&apos;s Upper West Side apartment is imposing and expansive, with high ceilings, old time plumbing, a clunky lift and a dingy laundry in the basement. It&apos;s a different set-up for such a thriller, no picket fence harmony house or beach side residence, this is bustling New York, big spaces, but as it turns out, that means no hiding place. The boys behind the cameras get the maximum they can from the locale by blending imposing and ominous with grainy veneer and filtered light. On the acting front, the girls put great effort into making their thinly developed characters work, with Leigh doing a good line in progressive instability. While Friedman, Weber and a wonderfully naughty Tobolowsky, make the most of their secondary roles. \n\nOne or two obvious flaws aside, this still rounds out as a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. 7.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Stree 2 is a decent sequel which does a good job of stitching the Maddock Supernatural Universe together and carve out the path for Vampires of Vijay Nagar, Bhediya 2 and Stree 3 over the next 2 years. The movie has its moments......some really funny but a few that dont land well and some pretty effective jump scares. The actors are as likable as they were in the first movie and the story flows well from the first part through the 2nd to the next one. Overall it is a good watch....but not as good as the first part.\n\nThe performances are good especially Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi and Abhishek Banerjee. Decent VFX and action. Some scenes and dialogs are really funny especially when delivered by these three. The cameos are pretty good. Akshay is weird, quirky and funny in his scene but didnt feel very menacing in the post credit sequence. Varun&apos;s character is well integrated in the movie and has a good entry scene but could have been utilized more effectively. His character lacks the punch and power of his first movie.\n\nThe run time of the movie is a bit long at 149 mins and would have benefited from a leaner and crisper production. The movie doesn&apos;t get boring but a tighter second half would have definitely lifted it up to the next level. If you liked Stree then you will enjoy Stree 2. However if Stree was not to your liking then Stree 2 is definitely not your cup of tea. It is a fun watch 7/10.",

I especially liked how James Purefoy expressed the dark of his character.\n\nThe fighting scenes are realistic, brutal and very convincing, and it is a real drawback that the chaotic camera movement spoiled that which is best in this movie.\n\nIf you like raw medieval action, violence and gore, then this is the movie for you.",

It is a joy watching these two outstanding thespians at work. It is amazing the intensity and depth they bring to their performances. They bring these tortured characters to life and you feel their pain. When I was getting ready to write this review, my first instinct was to say that there wasn&apos;t a really likable character in the film. That instinct was wrong. Its not that the characters aren&apos;t likable, its just that they are flawed and in deep emotional pain because one man didn&apos;t do his job as a responsible husband and father and the pain he caused lives after his death. This is a very dark film, very depressing, gritty and true to life. No &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; happy endings here folks. Surprisingly, I think it makes it a better movie. The only major beef I have with this film is the character of the boy Josh. He is without a doubt the most appalling child character since Wesley on Mister Belvedere. I kept wanting one of the adults to give him a good smack in his little fresh, dirty mouth. I always hate it in movies when they show smart aleck kids who talk to adults more strongly then real life kids would dare do!"

      "reviewBody": "Yesterday i saw this beautiful movie about life, love and death. After half an hour i had the feeling i was looking to a amazingly well balanced and touching film. Every scene, switches in time, music and countryside setting, the actors, the Flemish language ... it all seems to fit together. All credits for that, because the content is rather heavy: the life of the the two leading persons turns completely upside down when their child becomes very ill. The good thing is that - despite the dramatic events - the film doesn&apos;t become sentimental at all. The enormous grief is shown beautiful in small details like a bent hand (in the song if i needed you) or the facial expressions of the main actors. Amazing (and yet, easy to believe) how two people can react so different on a tragic event like losing your child.",

      "reviewBody": "Personally speaking, I don&apos;t quite know what to make of this picture. I saw it again on late night cable the other night and I was laughing hysterically throughout. Wesley and Woody play two brothers (!) who work as transit cops. Woody&apos;s a gambling junkie with a huge debt on his back while Wesley plays the straight man who&apos;s getting a little tired of constantly having to bail his brother out. Desperate, Woody plans to hijack the Money Train that rides along to each station, collecting the night&apos;s collections. Folks, believe me when I tell you that it actually gets more ridiculous. Add to the mix a pyromaniac token booth bandit, a pre-lobotomy Jennifer Lopez, Robert Blake in a performance so hammy that you can almost smell the bacon coming from your tv, action sequences that are unabashedly ridiculous and you have yourself... Money Train. My favorite moment comes when Robert Blake, after having been informed of the possibility of civilian casualties if the hijacked Money Train continues to speed ahead on the local line, responds with the now-classic line, &quot;That&apos;s what we live with.&quot; I was laughing so hard that tears were squirting out of my eyes. This movie is utterly ridiculous yet strangely riveting. Wesley Snipes plays his usual cocky, confident self and it seems to me that he won&apos;t accept a role these days unless he gets to kick someone in the face. Woody Harrelson looks like he smoked one too many blunts in this one. I actually prefer his character here over Wesley&apos;s and that&apos;s not saying much. Jennifer Lopez looks damn good but I can&apos;t help but think how stupid she is in real life. I really don&apos;t know where else to go with this review other than to recommend watching it. You might like it but not because it&apos;s quality stuff but because it&apos;ll cheer you up, it&apos;s so bad. Actual rating ** out of ***** but on the laugh-o-meter I&apos;ll give it a full **** out of *****."

      "reviewBody": "The Sessions brings to the screen the last years in the life of Marc O&apos;Brien, a polio patient who decides to lose his virginity at age 38. To do that, he gets the approval from his priest, and hires a sex surrogate who will guide him in the ways of love. So far, a little unusual maybe but nothing that would make you go &quot;why should I watch this?&quot;. You should for two reasons: the first one is the acting, starting with the criminally underrated performance of John Hawkes, who gives tremendous emotional depth to his character, a man prostrated for the rest of his life who manages to charm everyone around him, including the audience. Everyone else involved give very low-key, realistic and heartfelt performances: Helen Hunt and William H. Macy especially, but also the rest of the supporting cast. The acting is so good that at one point I forgot I was watching a movie and felt like I was listening to real people going through their experiences.\n\nThe second reason is the story itself. I did some research on line about the life of the real Marc O&apos;Brien and the film is pretty accurate and consistent with the facts; Marc&apos;s life is nothing short of extraordinary, especially if you consider that the film is based on an article of his that he had to type with a pen in his mouth. The people he met, the relationships he formed and how he formed them, all that is part of a very uplifting story which truly happened and is not adorned to make it more Hollywood-esque.\n\nAll of the above elements make for a very satisfying movie-going experience which I can&apos;t recommend highly enough. Everyone I know who&apos;s seen the movie has shared my feelings and it&apos;s exactly what I&apos;m trying to convey to you: go see it and you won&apos;t regret it.",

      "reviewBody": "This film reminded me of those cop films from the late 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s like &quot;The Seven Ups&quot; and &quot;The French Connection&quot; but this film is really dark and dirty. One thing that stands out is the cinematography that I&apos;ll describe later. Film opens with a cop chasing a suspect into a park and when shots are fired at one another a pregnant woman gets hit. Month&apos;s later the force wants him back to work with an older cop and investigate a cop killing. Jason Patric and Ray Liotta star in this film and its directed by Joe Carnahan who employs a very good visual style to an already familiar story. The film has a dark and gritty look about it that suggests a touch of &quot;Film Noir&quot;. One scene in particular stands out and its the one where Patric and Liotta are in a cafe having coffee and talking. The scene is dimly lit with both characters seemingly in shadows. It suggests that both are shadowy figures and have something to hide. Carnahan creates a dark mood for the film that I found very effective. Nothing seems forced here and it creates an indelible aura of bleakness. These are the streets that these cops work in everyday and you can understand some of the personality flaws of the characters. Ray Liotta stands out here and its the type of performance that reminds us why Scorsese cast him in &quot;Goodfellas&quot; in the first place. He gained 25 pounds for the role and along with Tom Cruise and a host of others helped produce this film. All the hard work paid off and I hope studios remember him with more work. He&apos;s always been a terrific actor and its hard to forget those eyes of his when he sinks his teeth into a role like this. They&apos;re was some talk of him being nominated for an Academy award in the supporting category which would be wrong. Both he and Patric are in the film about the same amount of time. They are both starring roles and its not a supporting performance. Some people complained of the dark edge and mood of the film but thats exactly what I liked about it. Well photographed and very well acted, this is a solid cop film that people should check out.",

I do wish Estella Warren had more to do in this film, because she is just LUSH! and one of my favourite models.  But it seems as though she has just been put in the film for the eye-candy, which is great but she needs to do more because she deserves a better chance to really make it as an actress. But overall it is quite entertaining with the racing scenes and the variety of locations they go to. Maybe it would&apos;ve been better if it took itself less seriously. A masterpiece it aint, but better than i expected and easy to watch. I say to all the people who are trashing this film, you are entitled to your opinion and so am i. My opinion is that you are a bunch of SNOBS!! Admit it, you are!\n\nRating- 8 out of 10"

      "reviewBody": "_Searching for Bobby Fischer_ is possessive of a certain wonderful insight; it is a film that offers no heart-warming premeses and still manages to ease the soul.\n\nThe characters dwell in an utterly contemporary world; you will find no neighbors hauling in bags of money, chiming churchbells, perfect families, or million-dollar smiles anywhere in the film.  At the same time, this world of this film exhibits a resilience against its crueler realities that most of the art of the twentieth century eschewed in favor of probing the darkness of existence.  Yes, the main characters are prosperous, but the spectre of Fischer hangs over the world as a daunting warning of things to come.  The mood of the piece, enhanced by the excellent cinematography, sets the film up to succeed wonderfully, and the actors and text deliver.\n\nOne of the things I like the most about this movie, superficially, is that it does not insult the game of chess as it depicts it.  The depiction of the chess world is insightful and accurate, from the sharp division between granite-hewn chess scholars and colorful tactical wizards to the truly unequaled awe and gravity accompanying the notion of the Grandmaster. Perhaps these are things that can only truly be appreciated by those who have ventured to this world, but, thankfully, the film integrates these elements seamlessly into a universal story that is original and poignant in its detail and elegance.\n\nEvery actor in this film is spectacular, without exception.  That is a bold statement, but it is completely justified.  At no point do any of the actors miss a step; all the performances are smooth and appear to be utterly effortless.  In their featured roles, Ben Kingsley and Lawrence Fishburne put in performances that match in art, craft, and intensity, if not in length, any of their more prominent film roles.  Joan Allen is mind-bogglingly wonderful, considering how precise she has to be to fit such a massive character into such a truncated part in the script.  This is Joe Mantena&apos;s very finest performance, and, of course, this movie contains child acting to match any film ever made.  Even the bit parts are acted with intensity, depth, and elegance.  A lot of this is easy to miss because, on the surface, the film is so even-handed, but repeated viewings continually bring to attention wonderful nuances of these performances.\n\nAny summary or synopsis will fail to accurately relate the &quot;message&quot; of this film; as in any great work of art, the quickest, most efficient way to word the resolution of the film&apos;s ideas and conflicts is to watch the film. This is where _Searching for Bobby Fischer_ really shines.  There is no way these characters could have ended up where they are from any other sequence of events than the one that took place; this is a wonderful example of how a plot is woven into a story rather than imposed on it.  The flipside of this is that there is extremely little to be found in this film that can be applied universally without reservation, and yet it still manages to be convincing.  There is something mysterious about this movie that rises toward the staggering mysteries of life, and repeated viewings are really the only means toward a full understanding of these ideas.\n\nUndoubtedly, this is the best film made in the 1990s based on a true story (if you, like me, discount _Schindler&apos;s List_ from such assessments.  It hardly seems fair to compare _Schindler&apos;s List_ to any other film due to its unique purpose.).  If you have not seen it, I highly recommend it.  It may just change your life.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Big Chill&quot; is about my peers. When first released in 1983, I, like the characters, was in my early thirties, a former rebellious collegian from the &apos;60s. After a decade in the work-a-day world, being a family man and raising babies, watching &quot;The Big Chill&quot; was like a fantastic time machine and took me back to places long forgotten. It really connected with me on a visceral level and I loved it. \n\nNow, almost twenty years later, I&apos;ve watched &quot;The Big Chill&quot; again. Same effect? Not exactly, although a lot of this may be due to the effect of viewing any movie a second time. My views of the 60s are not so gilded as they were then either. &quot;The Big Chill&quot; is still a very good movie; you have to love it for the ensemble acting. So many of the actors in the movie went on to have respected careers in the 80s and 90s. It&apos;s one of those rare movies like &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and &quot;Diner&quot; that served as a launch pad for acting careers.  And the soundtrack is perfect, capturing the breadth of late &apos;60s pop music. I really wish Kasdan had done with these characters, what Updike did with his &quot;Rabbit&quot; novels, that is, show the characters at ten year intervals through their lives. \n\nThis is one of the better movies of this type and is highly recommended even for the gen-x&apos;ers.",

There are a couple soft spots (narrative wise) that prevented me from going all 10-stars on this film, but it got as close as there is. And OH MY GOD, what amazing actors are Glenn Close and Anthony Pryce. There&apos;s a scene right near the end of the film in which their vulnerability is almost palpable. They went all-in with these characters, and it payed off. Standing ovation for those two.\n\nQuick suggestion: go watch this film without seeing the trailer. It will be a better experience if you know nothing about the plot. I watched the trailer beforehand and it ruined an important plot twist for me.",

Even though I liked it, I wouldn&apos;t trust those who say that it&apos;s fresh, inovative or is the best haunted house film.\n\n&quot;Haunt&quot; offers us an old concept with minor changes - addition of some cool elements which I won&apos;t discuss. A bunch of teens, with a (one way or another) troubled girl as the main character wind up in a hanted house attraction in the middle of nowhere. It&apos;s heard of, innit? This is where the better part of the movie starts, directors Beck and Woods manage to entertain us without cheese or unnecessary humor, instead giving us atmospheric enough trip through a what feels like an improvised but effective haunted house. Cool masks, many killers, fun times. With time it gets more gruesome, but also starts to suffer slightly from pacing issues &amp; the characters start doing (or not doing) questionable things/choices/actions. Let&apos;s just say that a some amount of general horror movie dumbness can be found in here as well. I found the ending to be a bit underwhelming, it felt like something either more original or more crazy could&apos;ve been done there. From an aesthethic standpoint, &quot;Haunt&quot; is just fine, not a Hollywood production, but not sloppy either &amp; the gore is great.\n\nAfter the first 50 minutes or so I was sure it&apos;s gonna be a 7/10, I can always appreciate and get a kick out of halloween-themed horror movies, but, sadly, &quot;Haunt&quot; ended not as a great movie, but as a good (or decent) one. A solid, relax-your-brains entertainment which You might visit another year around the time of Halloween season. My rating: 6/10.",

And this movie has plenty of depth that allows for interpretation. Definitely not a one trick pony!\n\nThe movie started slow, and I was bored for the first 15 minutes, but I hung in there and so glad I did. It&apos;s a really good movie! The acting is terrific. The characters are complex, each conveying some &quot;good&quot; and some &quot;bad&quot; as well as some mystery. The plot is complicated but eventually everything comes together. What you thought you knew, you eventually realize was far off base.\n\nThe constant twists are very effective at moving the storyline along at a pretty fast pace (I.e., you don&apos;t want to miss scenes or you will not get the full impact). Everything gets explained, but you have to pay attention to every scene.\n\nKudos to the writers and producers for tying up the storyline in a neat bow. So many other movies leave lose ends all over the place and fall short on the logic/explanation, but not this one. Stick with it until the end and you will be happy that you did!\n\nNot a perfect movie, but far better than average and definitely worth a watch. It&apos;s a really good example of what lesser films &quot;should&quot; mirror to be better.",

      "reviewBody": "From the moment front-runner Tammy Curry (Brooke Bushman) is blown to pieces on her sabotaged tractor, it&apos;s clear this beauty pageant will be fought tooth and nail. And it ain&apos;t gonna be pretty.\n\nIn the small Midwest community of Mount Rose, Minnesota, the Sarah Rose Miss Teen Princess contest is into the final furlong. But for all the sugar-coated spoutings of world peace and harmony hairspray, it&apos;s a question of victory by any means necessary - as a roving documentary film crew discovers.\n\nIn the Blue Ribbon rhubarb pie corner is Becky Leeman (Richards, rich kid daughter of former winner and rabidly proud officiating beauty pageant President Gladys (Alley). And in the red, trailer-trash corner is morgue make-up artist Amber Atkins (Dunst), championed by her boozy mother Annette (Barkin) and her mother&apos;s morally suspect best friend Loretta (Janney).\n\nCasting wise it&apos;s spot on, as Alley launches with smiley, viper spitefulness into a beacon of single-minded hypocrisy, and is well matched by Richards, even if she looks the least convincing high school teenager since Stockard Channing&apos;s Rizzo enrolled in Rydell High. Dunst meanwhile blossoms into a very accomplished actress, and - together with Barkin and Janney - claims most of the prize lines.\n\nIf there&apos;s a weakness it&apos;s that the mockumentary approach doesn&apos;t always work, and the film drags on a little too long after a seemingly natural conclusion. Still, the dark laughs are consistent, and the parody of middle America&apos;s bizarre beauty contest fixation is spiked with some jolting shock tactics - from the nurse-assisted wheelchair dance by the reigning anorexic crown holder to Richards&apos; hilarious (not to mention blasphemous) love song for Jesus - but such blackness never obstructs rooting for Dunst&apos;s likable teen. An outrageous, deliciously bad-taste classic.\n\n8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Replicas (3 out of 5 stars).\n\nReplicas is a decent science fiction thriller that has some interesting concept and ideas but falls short from a terrible script, logic, and dull performances. Without trying to give away many spoilers. William (Keanu Reeves) works for a biomedical research in trying to transfer a mind of a dead person into an android. After an failed attempt. William&apos;s wife Mona (Alice Eve), his son Matt (Emjay Anthony), Sophie (Emily Alyn Lind), and Zoe (Aria Leabu) are involved an accident. William becomes a mad scientist that will do whatever it takes to save his family.\n\nThe film could have been so much more. It has an interesting concept at play such as cloning a human being and transferring their minds into the new body. Also some scary ideas of deleting memories. William becomes a mad scientist that wants to go beyond the laws of nature to save his family. He steals the lab equipment and has it set in his basement. Even his coworker/ friend Ed (Thomas Middleditch) becomes worried of Williams obsession in his research.\n\nSadly, the film does have its fault. It has questionable cgi/visual effects that looks terrible. Especially on the scene with the android coming to life. Looks like a bad Claymation. Second, the script has some laughable dialogue that seems out of place or unbelievable. The first hour of the movie is dull and boring when just watching Keanu Reeve&apos;s mad scientists behavior with his experiments. Sure, his actions does get a little messed up and may have trouble trying to find emotions to the character.\n\nKeanu Reeves did deliver an emotionless mad scientist in this film. Sure, it may work for his performance as a one dimensional type of character. Alice Eve was decent as her character. Thomas Middleditch was okay as well. And John Ortiz playing the typical corporate bad guy was forgettable.\n\nOverall, Replicas is a fair film. It has some entertaining science fiction moments with the concept after the first hour of the movie. The script and visual effects are bad. The performances are stale. This film does not rank up to being a memorable science fiction type of movie.",

We are given a hint about what&apos;s coming right on the opening sequence when the Chevy Malibu, driven by the spooky Frank Parnell, is stopped on a highway.\n\nAlex Cox, the innovative director of &quot;Repo Man&quot;, made a film that mixes a lot of movie genres with a satisfying result. That&apos;s why when it was discovered, it became a huge cult movie. It was one of the films that had midnight screenings for its many fans that flocked to have a great time and who identified themselves with the movie.\n\nThe best thing in the film is the interaction between Bud and Otto. Harry Dean Stanton has always play cool parts and this movie is no exception. Emilio Estevez gave, what might be, his best movie performance as the young punk that gets to meet a world he never knew existed. All the players gave their best to Mr. Cox and the result is a film that, in some ways, might baffle at first, but once the viewer gets into it, he will be hooked.\n\nIggy Pop&apos;s music is an excellent partner for the action. Alex Cox is an innovative director, as he proves with &quot;Repo Man&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Muriel&apos;s wedding is a solid work of Australian comedy, with great acting and a funny script, however I also found it a touch sad.\n\nThe film kept taking emotional turns, from hilarious to depressing. The main character, Muriel Heslop (Toni Collette), was funny in a very human way. She shows the audience a quirky, yet believable example of human fallibility, as the girl who never quite meets the standard. Muriel&apos;s character is defined by her inability to fit in - despite many attempts. She has a dysfunctional family and weird obsessions with Swedish pop group ABBA, and getting married.\n\nAll the characters play emotional roles, and the acting performance by Collette and Rachel Griffiths (as Muriels best friend), are inspirational.\n\nI laughed a lot, but came away with a general sense of sadness about the emotional cruelty of human beings, and the suffering some people endure. I found the character of Muriel&apos;s mother particularly sad, but well acted.\n\nMany people I&apos;ve talked to hated this film, but it remains one of my favourite comedies. As someone who really enjoys Aussie films, I think this was one of the better ones.",

      "reviewBody": "Michael Moore&apos;s latest feature, Capitalism: A Love Story, has everything I could want from one of his films: a hotly debated and relevant issue, information, personal accounts, funny clips, and great music. I enjoy seeing his films not so much to be informed, which I feel he does quite well, but to be entertained. That is something rare with a documentary. I don&apos;t think you can say the same about An Inconvenient Truth.\n\nLove him or hate him, Moore makes a fantastic film. This time he takes one the recent economic turmoil this country has been facing for the past year or so. Moore traces it&apos;s roots back to the Reagan administration on up. He presents a lot of facts, memos, and documents some companies and banks would not like us to see, but he does it because the people have a right to know.\n\nI can&apos;t say much about what went on because Moore presents a lot of data, but to the best of my ability I can say that there is an awful lot of shady activity going on behind closed doors. We look at the bail out plan proposed to congress. We see how companies like Goldman Sachs infiltrates the government and starts doing their own bidding. We see companies spend their money frivolously while workers and homeowners are losing their jobs and livelihood. Some of these banks and groups do terrible things that force people into uncomfortable and downright oppressive situations.\n\nOne thing I expected to see from this film was Moore perspective and nothing else. I don&apos;t know what information he is withholding and what truths he is stretching, but I am impressed with how convincing some of his arguments and testimonials are. He plays on our heartstrings like a trained musician, hitting home with issues involving blue collar Americans struggling to keep their jobs, their homes, and their families together.\n\nAside from the content of the film, the actual film itself is very well put together. He makes excellent use of stock footage from the 50s and 60s, weaving them perfectly to fit the film&apos;s flow. One thing Moore does better than most is his use of music to drive home a point or a feeling. Be it classical, rock, or country, Moore blends it all together quite nicely.\n\nThis film makes you think. It makes you angry. It makes you want to do something, and that&apos;s okay. That is what a film is supposed to do. It is designed to evoke some sort of emotion and help spring it forth. That&apos;s not to say you should go out and do something drastic, but it will at least make for excellent conversation amongst friends and coworkers.",

      "name": "Revisionist treatment with pluses and minuses",
      "reviewBody": "There are very few works of 20th-century American literature that can be called indispensable to our understanding of our culture. And one of these few is Jack Kerouac&apos;s On the Road. As everyone knows, it&apos;s the thinly-veiled autobiographical account of Kerouac and his friends in their pointless but exuberant adventures across America. For 50 years, it&apos;s been waiting to be made into a movie. Now, at last.\n\nSo, everyone already knows the story well, no; chances are, if you&apos;re like me, you read the book and yet remember almost nothing of the story. The book burns through its shreds of storyline as if they were just tinder for the blaze of its energy; the real fuel is the pacing, even with all its redundancy. It&apos;s the momentum that sucks us into the breathless chaos of Kerouac&apos;s world. We come away impressed by the energy, not the content.\n\nFilm could certainly have been used to amplify this effect, but this is not that film. Instead, we have a more conventional treatment, focusing on character development. It&apos;s a nice production, with an attractive cast. But the story comes at us very differently from the book experience. The manuscript has been rewritten to add breathing space and objectivity. We see Sal Paradise, only half-formed at the start of the story, pull himself together to become a serious writer. We see the endlessly exuberant Dean Moriarity ultimately coming to grips with the progressive self- destruction attributable to his amorality, and suffering. This might be a fair reading of Kerouac&apos;s ultimate feelings about that part of his life, but it&apos;s not the feeling that Kerouac shares with us in the book. We have lost our innocence; our last chance to revisit it, even for a few hours, is taken away.\n\nI&apos;m not going to rage against this re-conception of the story, though, because it makes other changes from the book that might be improvements. Several episodes that were censored from the book are restored in the film. (Some discussion of this at http://www.univie.ac.at/Anglistik/easyrider/data/BeatEros.htm). So the movie is more historically accurate, and far more sexually explicit than the book. (That could also explain its delayed US release). In one poignant scene, Carlos Marx (Allen Ginsberg) is whining to Sal about how vulnerable he feels due to his poorly-returned love for Dean. To the best of my recollection, that conversation was not in the book (please tell me if you believe otherwise), but was expressed in a private letter from Ginsberg to Kerouac many years after the fact. This kind of thing changes the emotional flow of the story, certainly, but it adds depth, too.\n\nFew of us will actually suffer nostalgia for the gritty overindulgences of the Beats. But remember, this came at a time when society was absolutely saturated with the message that everyone should be &quot;normal,&quot; safe, predictable. Without the tiny minority of Beats attacking that message, and specifically without On The Road to chronicle that attack, the cultural revolution of the 1960&apos;s would have been even more difficult than it was, and perhaps less effective. Good, bad, or ugly, we must embrace this story.",

I really liked it and it has to do with the acting, the mood it builds up, the tension throughout and how it makes sense altogether. That doesn&apos;t mean that everyone enjoys it or will enjoy watching it. Especially if you can&apos;t wrap your head around what is happening - or how it is happening. Some won&apos;t like how it turns out (no pun intended), but it was fitting in my book.

      "reviewBody": "Voyeurism is a funny thing. Watching other people&apos;s little dramas or lives may seem boring at the outset, but often times it can be just as interesting, if not more so, than anything a big studio can come up with. With &quot;Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father,&quot; we as an audience get a glimpse into a man that we otherwise would never have known. And after viewing this film, I have to graciously thank writer/director Kurt Kuenne for this.\n\nAfter the murder of his lifelong best friend, Dr. Andrew Bagby, filmmaker Kurt Kuenne decided to go and interview everyone who knew Andrew in order to give his late friend&apos;s soon-to-be born son a way to know his father. But unbeknownst to anyone, this film would turn into something completely different.\n\nReviewing this film is difficult. For one thing, no one had any idea where this film was going (Kuenne, who narrates, openly admits this, although no one could possibly imagine what was going to happen). But more importantly, this film has something that many films don&apos;t: passion. It has a voice. This film will make you laugh, cry, scream in both terror and anger, and so much more. Even the most politically, one-sided films do not speak to the viewer like this film. In that sense, this film is a masterpiece.\n\nBut, on a critical scale, it comes up a little short. For me, the most effective bits were the interviews about Andrew. Those were funny and touching. Even if it added a few extra minutes to the running time, it would have been worth it. I felt like I could have watched a whole day&apos;s worth of interviews about Andrew. But the film gets into the struggle between Shirley Turner, Andrew&apos;s ex-girlfriend and probable murderer and Andrew&apos;s parents, who are trying to seek custody Andrew&apos;s son, Zachary. The film sort of loses focus at times, and it really inhibits Kuenne&apos;s goal in letting us know who Andrew was. At the end, it almost seems like a piece of propaganda (see the movie and you&apos;ll understand). Judging by what happens, this isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing, but still. Of minor note, the film only shows the good things about Andrew. Not that Kuenne turns him into some sort of flawless figure (Bagby does that himself), but it would have made Bagby seem more well-rounded.\n\nYet I wholeheartedly recommend this film. It introduces us to a wonderful person, and his name was Andrew Bagby.",

There are chilling moments, and it takes unexpected paths, always supported by excellent performances and a highly imaginative camera work.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame that some small details don&apos;t live up to the rest of the work - yes, the typical &quot;why did you go there and didn&apos;t call the police&quot; kind of thing - including a hurried conclusion that should have provided more answers and a more convincing resolution.",

      "reviewBody": "I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect with this movie since the &quot;Loch Ness&quot; subject matter is kind of an overused topic. The fact that people said it was &quot;family friendly&quot; was also a strong turn-off: kiddie characters, themes ... &apos;nuf said.\n\nHowever, I&apos;m glad I saw this movie! It had a good, interesting story and great characters. The special effects were pretty good too. Even though the lead character is a young kid, it was OK since all of the characters and story were realistic and serious - and not depicted from a kid&apos;s point of view.\n\nThe story is framed around a modern-day pub where an old-timer is telling a couple young hikers/travelers the story of a picture on the wall. The bulk of the story takes place during WWII at Loch Ness and centers around a little boy that discovers and takes home a large egg.\n\nI&apos;ll pretty much confirm what other&apos;s have said. Yes - it&apos;s fit for viewing by all members of the family, but don&apos;t let that stereotype trap you into thinking it&apos;s only for kids. If you&apos;re in the mood for something light, this is a good movie and worth checking out.",

After each confession, a new detail is added into the story until it became a complete story at the end.\n\nI feel empty. Very disturbing. The movie remains dark and cold from the beginning until the end. A great thing in this movie is that you don&apos;t know who you should hate. Yes, it&apos;s obvious that they have done something terribly wrong, but after each confession, they suddenly became the victim, and then after the movie finished, you ended up feeling the sympathy for every characters.\n\nThe acting in this movie is absolutely fabulous. Just look at those eyes of the students. Cold and heartless. I watched it with my mouth wide open. The plot is perfect. I don&apos;t know what to complain. There are even some bloody scenes added to it, which make the movie more interesting.\n\nI love it.",

Netflix really needs to change the movies department. They have only couple of good series and thats all.\n\nI cant say anything for the rest of the characters. Because they were so cliche.

I did not know what to expect, but it was a gem! It kept me smiling throughout the whole film!! The kids in the movie and those watching at home learn important lessons about empathy and self-forgiveness from wise lizard Leo (Sandler) and his ability to lend a supportive ear. It was one of the best family films I&apos;ve seen in a long time! The film can be summed up in one of its final lines: &quot;Find your Leo (a representation of meaningful listening, mixed with prudent advice) to listen to you.&quot; The &quot;Leos&quot; we should look for can connect and offer sound advice precisely because they are lovingly listening rather than dictating. I love a film with a positive message, which is why I resonated with the story! Bravo to Adam Sandler, who is a fantastic voice actor! The humor and songs were catchy and funny! The last movie I loved from Sandler was 50 First Dates, and afterward, I couldn&apos;t connect with his films until Leo! It&apos;s been a while since I praised Sandler, but this movie deserves that adoration!",

If you watch the trailer for this movie it is very misleading, not to say its a bad movie but it&apos;s not at all what I expected. This is a true life account that I&apos;m sure has happened to many people. An 8 year old girl named Abby starts to send Nev paintings she has done after seeing a picture Nev took in a newspaper. Out of that Nev begins to talk with Angela (Abby&apos;s mom) and it carries over to Megan (Abby&apos;s sister). After quickly falling in love with Megan, Nev soon discovers Megan may not be who she says she is and plans a trip to visit her and find out the truth. Every once in a while a movie comes along that you just have to keep watching and your not sure why, and when it&apos;s over your not sure why it had this grip on you, this is one of those movies. This is not for everyone, being that it is a documentary and slow in parts, but it is very interesting and has an ending that sneaks up on you and affects you in a way you can&apos;t explain.

      "reviewBody": "One question I always have about these cube movies is, how does throwing a boot into the empty room tell you it&apos;s safe or not? This feels like rehash from the other sequels. But, in those films we discover some traps are triggered by other things, not by weight, or movement, or sound, but heat.\n\nAfter this scene, one man exclaims perhaps it was triggered by heat or sound, but that isn&apos;t possible because the boot hitting the floor was pretty loud. Most likely it was triggered by a camera picking up a human form in the middle of the room.\n\nAfter being disappointed by the follow through of part 1 and 2, I looked forward to a prequel finally making some sense of all this, and being a enjoyable film. Kind of like what Hellraiser 3 Bloodline did for that series.\n\nNow we have 2 workers, overseeing this project to some capacity. We never see their higher ups, but we do see a higher level of command in part 2.\n\nThey seem to not mind too much what is going on, for they believe they men and women inside the cube are convicted criminals.\n\nWe know this to not be the truth at all.\n\nThe fact that in part 1 they followed a puzzle of numbers, primes in particular, in part 2, well I don&apos;t remember what they followed then, 5 dimensional cubes are funny that way. BUt, in this one, they find a similar puzzle, but this time in sets of letters.\n\nFor lack of ingenuity, and originality, I scoff at the simplicity of the parallel plots at this point, but I trudge on, without judgment... keeping my mind on the third exit.\n\n&quot;When the rooms align what&apos;s the first thing that happens?&quot; &quot;Clean Sweep&quot; Which is what we saw at the very end of part 2... you ever wonder why at the end of part 2 when the girl, company employee plant in the cube, escapes the cube, with some sort of plumb device around her neck intact, as the cube seems to &quot;clean sweep&quot; itself into oblivion, they kill her? Did you think that question was going to be answered in the next movie? Do you still think it&apos;s going to be answered, in Cube Zero? Owen reaching the exit room reminds me a lot of the ending of Cube 1, I suppose that was the point.\n\nExit Procedure is very Nazism isn&apos;t it.\n\nAnyways, I noticed later on they weren&apos;t even waiting for the boot to hit the floor before entering a new room, that didn&apos;t make a whole lot of sense, although the sound vibration death was quite cool.\n\nPretty nice ending, the way Wynn becomes Kazan-ized. Makes you wonder just how Kazan got the way he was doesn&apos;t it? People ask what is the point of this movie, or this trilogy, or franchise... and to my knowledge there is no point. Unless you look for a more anamorphic point. And that is the point within.\n\nThere is no great moral here, no blatant and obvious tell tale morality. No, be good or this could happen to you, there is no rhyme nor reason. Perhaps the only point to be gleamed from such an adventure is thus.\n\nThe CUBE is the mind. The traps are desires, ignorance, apathy, and the like. We are lab rats in consciousness, trying to get from birth to the white light at the end, without falling into the traps of our own egos if you will.\n\nAt least, that is my perspective.",

It&apos;s good, clean fun, and very entertaining for children and adults alike. It&apos;s Lizzie McGuire (probably the only decent programme on the Disney Channel - oh why did they stop it?) and her pals having an adventure in Italy! But whilst this is just an ordinary Roman history trip for everyone else, Lizzie gets whisked away to stardom when she meets Italian popstar, Paolo Valisari. Full of friendship problems, other catastrophes, Matt and Melina&apos;s usual (international) shenanigans and a little bit of (clean) romance, the Lizzie McGuire movie fails not to entertain. It&apos;s the perfect film to watch on a rainy day (or whilst driving through hot, remote areas of Turkey in a coach - that&apos;s how I watched it).",

      "name": "Greenaway&apos;s elaborate and ornate revenger&apos;s tragedy - a must see film!",
      "reviewBody": "With the Cook, the Thief, his Wife and her Lover, Greenaway creates a self-contained world that is both a fabrication and abstraction of reality, but also an extremist reflection (nee, microcosm) of British society in the nineteen-eighties. The characters that he chooses to put forward to the audience as protagonists are archetypes of social and political caricatures that we would find in that particular decade; but heightened to conform to the over-the-top opulence/pestilence found central to the plot. His ability to craft characters and situations that resonate beyond the context of a particular scenario, coupled with his bitterness and unwillingness to conform is what sets him up as a satirist of serious note. He also elevates the film beyond the realms of mere art-house experimentation by fashioning a seriously funny script, which has ample opportunities for central character Albert Spica to prove himself the ultimate charismatic bully - part cockney hard man, part pantomime villain - who is never less than compulsively terrifying.\n\nThe plot is a simple construct centred on the theme of revenge and the need for personal freedom. This is mixed in with the socio-political undertones as well as Greenaway&apos;s many references to art, theatre, film and literature. It is also elevated by the impeccable cinematic qualities that we hold synonymous with the director&apos;s work. Everything here is about pushing things beyond the reasonable limitations; so we have a stunningly intricate set that is both theatrically simplistic, but also as other-worldly as anything from the work of say Gilliam or Jeunet. The costumes by Jean Paul Gaultier scream over-the-top chic, whilst often mirroring the use of colour employed by the production designers. Greenaway even breaks continuity by having Helen Mirren&apos;s costumes change colour as she moves through each room of the restaurant, so that we have a green dress in the kitchen, a red dress in the dinning area (inspired by Hitchcock&apos;s vertigo no less) and a white dress in the lavatory. It&apos;s an audacious move, but one that pays off in the creation of a completely self-contained world; something that is further established by Sacha Vierny&apos;s sumptuous cinematography and the wonderfully bombastic music of the ever-excellent Michael Nyman.\n\nSome have clearly found the film&apos;s various abstractions problematic (yes, it is theatrical, yes it is occasionally shocking, and yes, it does evolve in a world of its own ostentatious creation). But it&apos;s also as artistic a film as you can get; a fact that some here have disputed. The reason that some define this as artistic refers to the use of colour, light and composition. The architecture of the sets too, and the way in which the production designers have chosen to dress them also adds to the artistic stylisation of the film. These factors are important to the narrative, as they are symbolic to what Greenaway is trying to convey, as well as what the characters are all about. Because of this, the design of the film becomes AS important as the framework, if not more so. But this film is more than a mere arty exploration; it&apos;s funny and intelligent and features a slew of great performances from a wonderfully eclectic cast. Michael Gambon as the thief Spica gives a grandstand performance to rival his own Phillip Marlow from The Singing Detective; hamming things up spectacularly but still retaining that much needed sense of humanity. The same can be said of the other principals too.\n\nMirren as the wife exudes a quite and restrained sexuality in what must be her best performance, whist Richard Bohringer as the cook is in some represents the linchpin/catalyst for the film. Elsewhere we find everyone from Tim Roth to Ian Dury popping up to give the film some added character and easily furthering the film&apos;s already cult appeal. This was a turning point for Greenaway; a move towards the more expressive, elaborate and self-contained style of film-making found in films like Prospero&apos;s Books and the Baby of Maçon and away from the more easy to digest classics like the Draughtsman&apos;s Contract, Drowning by Numbers and A Zed and Two Noughts."

      "reviewBody": "Directed by the team of Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, &quot;Lovelace&quot; is a short and not-so-sweet Hollywoodization of the real-life story of Linda Boreman, a.k.a. adult movie sensation Linda Lovelace. At 21 years old, she&apos;s living with her uptight parents (Robert Patrick and an unrecognizable Sharon Stone) when she meets charming stranger Chuck Traynor (Peter Sarsgaard). He&apos;s actually a pretty sleazy guy who finagles her into a job in porn films, specifically the landmark effort &quot;Deep Throat&quot;. He also turns out to be an abusive monster, whose atrocities were recounted by Linda in her book &quot;Ordeal&quot;.\n\nWith these Hollywood versions of such stories, it&apos;s always advisable to take them with a grain of salt. For one thing, even this viewer, who&apos;s not particularly knowledgeable about the adult film industry, knows full well that Linda did a fair bit more than just that one classic. &quot;Lovelace&quot; the movie actually leaves out some things to focus on limited story threads. The filmmakers try to be clever with their narrative by jumping back and forth in time, but this could only be confusing for some in the audience.\n\nIt&apos;s worth a look just to watch Epstein, Friedman, and company give us a look into the porn filmmaking scene in the 1970s. Time and place are well captured, but the soundtrack tends to get annoying; we don&apos;t need these constant reminders of when the story largely takes place. The film IS very slick, and makes its points in approximately an hour and a half, so it doesn&apos;t overstay its welcome.\n\nThe strength lies in the talents of the ensemble cast. Amanda Seyfried is appealing as the not-so-innocent but still endearing Linda, while Sarsgaard, no stranger to creepy roles, is convincing as the slime ball husband. Stone gives a creditable performance in a severely deglamourized role, and Adam Brody is a hoot as porn legend Harry Reems. James Franco is charisma-free and miscast as Hugh Hefner.\n\nThere is enough compelling material here for one to realize that a more in-depth recounting of the tale would be appreciated.\n\nSix out of 10.",

Read this review but not those that will disclose the mysterious underpinnings of one of the best docs this year. \n\nYes, things do not all turn well after the initial exaltation over their finding each other. The doc expertly distributes the dark revelations as if we were their friends slowly learning astonishing facts about the triplets from separation to owning a restaurant called, what else, Triplets. Not only do we see the nuances of differences among the triplets, but we also get tantalizing looks into the machinery of adoption, not all happy to be sure.\n\nAs adults, Robert Sheridan, David Kellman, and Eddy Galland are outgoing and articulate (only two are talking heads, while Eddy&apos;s part is archival footage). Good for director Wardle letting them tell the story without prompting, for effective docs mostly let the camera roll and the subject talk. This doc will grab you and not let you go-you&apos;ll hunger for more.\n\nAs the background of the adoption and the testimony reveals startling information, our natural inclination is to contrast the three different social backgrounds to see the effects of nature vs. nurture. Indeed social scientists are here plying their trade, sometimes in unethical ways yet food for the thriller part of this engrossing film. \n\nAlthough the nature/nurture debate is never fully deconstructed, I was pleased with the taste of it, as most social scientists must be in such a delicious dramatic stew. I&apos;m done writing for fear of spoiling one of the delights of this documentary: What comes next? \n\nDon&apos;t even Google because you can find the details there. Most desirable is to witness how artfully through excellent film you can find in reality that truth can be stranger than fiction. And definitely not fake. \n\nThree Identical Strangers is one of the year&apos;s best documentaries. It has it all but the definitive answer to the central mystery. Learn more by seeing it, not Googling it."

      "reviewBody": "A film worth revisiting, if my experience is anything to go by. I didn&apos;t think it was up to much the first time, but the BBC put it on again and this time I watched it twice and probably will at least once more, partly for Julianne Moore, who&apos;s pretty astonishing, playing an almost unprecedentedly monstrous grotesque, and partly for the frequent patches of brilliantly written dialogue (take a bow, Bruce Wagner). Moore&apos;s dialogue is almost always good, but that of 13-year-old move star and recovering drug abuser Benji also packs a vicious punch, and elsewhere, more subtly, in the mouths of Mia Wasikovska and Robert Pattinson&apos;s characters, Wagner does probably the best depiction I&apos;ve ever seen of how young adults actually talk a lot of the time: confused, insecure and just barely covering it up.\n\nAll this is something like what we might see - and most importantly hear - if anyone ever filmed a Brett Eason Ellis novel properly, without being afraid of going to town on the dialogue (why hasn&apos;t Cronenburg ever worked with Ellis?). As such, it&apos;s an interesting point of comparison with Cronenburg&apos;s previous film, Cosmopolis, also heavy on the chilly, anomic modern rich person dialogue, courtesy of Don de Lillo, which, taken on its own, looks like woefully pretentious proof that you can&apos;t do this in film. Turns out you can, with bells on, though actually, Cronenburg films have been demonstrating this at least since Dead Ringers.\n\nOther than these talky highlights, I think this film has a few problems of its own, some of them maybe also around pretentiousness. The big one for me is just the messiness of the message and plot, as a unity, which it isn&apos;t really. Moore&apos;s storyline on its own is a perfect, pitilessly poisonous Hollywood satire. Does it really need, in addition, a parallel plot that never quite meshes about incest and schizophrenia? Why? To round it out to feature film length? To give it some spurious intellectual heft in the form of references to Greek tragedy and elemental symbolism?\n\nTo be honest, there may be a puzzle here that I haven&apos;t worked out, because quite a lot of that dialogue I like so much seems to be satirising precisely such tendencies, particularly when Moore&apos;s character ghoulishly invokes fire and water to implicitly celebrate the death of a child because it gets her a part. And that&apos;s another reason I might watch again. But still, the problem remains, I don&apos;t think you need the incest or the schizophrenia to satirise Hollywood, because it introduces a sort of separate issue, a distinct emotional antagonist if you will, where Hollywood itself seems like the real target and should surely be all you need to explain all this very bad behaviour.",

The fact that I have no emotion or attachment to the characters makes me dislike this film. The book apparently is much better but this doesn&apos;t make me want to read it. With other romances that are good, the couple belong together, but in this, it just doesn&apos;t make sense, they don&apos;t seem to fit together just right. Also, the mother of the girl is deranged, she has no understanding of the daughter&apos;s emotions whatsoever by the looks of it and yet they get along perfectly fine as a happy family. The girl also has many issues in her past, yet she doesn&apos;t seem broken at all by this. Wouldn&apos;t recommend, a boring watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Always curious about The Black Cauldron, I finally got around to it after seeing a DVD at the rental store. Despite a lot of grating elements, I ended up liking it overall.\n\nThe movie starts off on the wrong foot. The voices come across as recorded at low fidelity, and when combined with the sometimes hard-to-understand British accents, can be somewhat off-putting. Issues with voice and script become even more pronounced with characters such as Gurgi and his Gollum-esquire speech patterns. Indeed, the second time I watched the DVD I threw the English subtitles on, and not just for Gurgi.\n\nOther problems with voicing include an exceedingly dull lead actor for Taran (he simply can&apos;t emote), and an overly chirpy female lead for Eilonwy.\n\nMost other elements of the film proved passable if predictable in the Disney mold of plot, hero design, sidekicks, etc. Where it branches out for the better is in avoiding any and all musical interludes and along the way offering some scenarios and graphic effects that are more mature than most other Disney animated feature films (though later in the &apos;90s the likes of The Lion King, Hunchback, and Tarzan would also tangle with mature themes).\n\nAnimation is also spectacularly mixed in quality, an odd distinction among Disney films but a distinction nonetheless. Usually solid, there are high points such as external shots of a dark castle or a visceral chase sequence. There are also low points such as unnatural shifts in hair color that overemphasize different environments, or obvious spots where animation was rushed (a rock slide sequence).\n\nYet for all these lows and highs, as an animation fan I ended up siding with the high points. Many sequences are inviting to re-watch, even if the entirety of the movie may not be. For all the talk of failure that continues to surround this movie, one can see in the film itself elements of a more mature Disney that could have been extremely promising with a more seasoned batch of animators and a world less hostile to PG animated fare.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Railway Man&quot; is a sober restrained film for much of its running time. Its low key approach makes the torture scenes and the depictions of Eric Lomax&apos;s searing post-war nightmares all the more horrifying and unforgettable. The acting is uniformly excellent. The direction and all the technical contributions are admirable. I normally never consciously notice the sound design, but here it contributes intelligently and gently to several episodes. I was particularly fascinated to see Eric and the other signals staff emerging into the sunlight from the underground &quot;Battle Box&quot; headquarters in Fort Canning Park, Singapore. I toured it in 2007; it is now a museum peopled by realistic waxworks of the soldiers, senior and junior, who were there on surrender day, 15th February 1942.\n\nYet the film has several irritating shortcomings. The title character, Eric, was 61 at the time of the scenes set in 1980. Good as he is, Colin Firth is visibly too young. Perhaps it shouldn&apos;t matter, given the power of his performance, but it gets in the way if you try to make sense of the time lapses.\n\nThe very down to earth portrayal of Eric&apos;s lonely life is immensely touching, as in the scene where his new love Patti wants to scrub clean the cooking pot in his grubby bachelor kitchen. But such practical matter of fact detail inevitably invites down to earth speculation such as &quot;Where does the characters&apos; money come from?&quot; This tiresome little problem hardly matters in more fantastical Hollywood sagas where everyone is filthy rich or in possession of superpowers. Eric is shown to drive a Triumph 2000, a car typically owned by the affluent middle classes of that time. (I have not seen one for years. The Triumph marque disappeared long ago along with much of the British car industry. The equivalent British middle classes now drive BMWs, Mercedes and Audis). This fine car and his neglected house are the only signs that he had a successful and productive working life between 1945 and 1980.\n\nHis tormented friend at the veterans club notes how the survivors of the 1940s horrors are now bank clerks, teachers, engineers, retired people; honest productive citizens, whose unsung post war endurance is as admirable as their war time survival. (One of my teachers around 1969 had been a Prisoner of War at Changi Prison in Singapore, but you would never have heard it from him.) Presumably many of these gentle heroes were married, as was Eric. But his failed post-war marriage and two children are unmentioned in the movie. As are Patti&apos;s three children. Somehow, despite a failed marriage, she has the cash to tour Britain. The fact that she had been married is barely hinted at (she describes herself as single again). The fact that the real Patti lived in Canada for many years is unmentioned.\n\nEven a passing mention of the characters&apos; histories could have considerably enriched the film. As it stands, it feels as if they were dropped into the story from Mars.\n\nIn his book &quot;Hollywood vs America&quot;, the critic Michael Medved noted the inviolable barrier between Church and Studio in most Hollywood films. The same deep rooted reluctance to mention spiritual matters, even when they are relevant to the characters, is very evident in this film. The only sign of the prisoners&apos; religious leanings in this real Valley of the Shadow of Death is the recitation of a Psalm in one scene. Eric&apos;s deep Christian faith helped him through the nightmare and perhaps lead to his forgiveness of his tormentor decades later. He carried a Bible for decades during and after his imprisonment until it was utterly worn.\n\nYou can get the background story from the book. For the price of a cinema ticket, it is much better value for money. You get at least a limited sense of the vanished Britain of the 1920s and 1930s when Eric grew up. The lovingly described details of the social and industrial environment that formed him make sense of how this man came to be a survivor. A new preface in the movie tie-in edition describes how Eric did not want to see the finished film; he died before it was released. If he had seen it, he might have pointed out, in the most polite manner, how much of the really important story had been left out.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m biased. There&apos;s no two ways about it. They could have gotten two six years olds to draw the cels, a troop of monkeys to write the dialogue and then printed the film upside down and full of static and I&apos;d still have loved it (if anybody out there says &apos;Didn&apos;t they do that anyway?&apos;, I&apos;ll thump them.) I am one of a dying but suprisingly populous breed: the Tranformers fan, and to me this film is like the Holy grail.\n\nIf you think I&apos;m going to get all gooey and teary-eyed then go into nostalgia overload then forget it because I&apos;m not. I say this with a straight face and a critic&apos;s eyes: this is a good film. It may be a two hour toy commercial. It may have made zip at the box offce. It may get bad press from idiotic fossils that just aren&apos;t prepared to make the effort to tap into the universe the film is set in. But the fact remains that to anybody that&apos;s grown up with Transformers, this film is marvelous. Why? Because it does it right! The characters act right. The style is right. It&apos;s all done so perfectly that no right minded Transfan could possibly complain. How many Batman fans (and I mean real Batman fans) can honestly say the same thing about their film franchise.\n\nIt&apos;s easy to get preachy about the violence in a film aimed at kids. It gives the moral majority something to do other than examine each Disney film for subliminal messages. I found it refreshing to actually see this kind of film refuse to pull its punches. It&apos;s an action film without tapping into the over-sentimental gushy stuff that usually turns kids off anyway. This is a war. Death and violence are part of it. Will it effect the children that watch it. Maybe, but I don&apos;t know which way. I saw first saw the film when I was 7. I saw all of my favourites get blown apart. I saw my absolute, total, complete and utter hero, the person that personified all that was good and noble to me (you know who I mean) get killed saving his friends in an ultimate display of bravery and courage. I cried. My mum cried. I still do. I think that one moment made me more afraid and ashamed of death and destruction than a dozen Private Ryans.\n\nThe animation is top notch, there&apos;s an amazing soundtrack and the voice talent is good too. Not perfect, but Nimoy&apos;s portrayal of Galvatron is incredible. Espicially when you consider that it was probably done as a &apos;For the money not the art&apos; job. The script isn&apos;t bad either. It has a host of sharp, quotable one-liners that would put Bruce Willis to shame (&quot;I&apos;ve got better things to do tonight than die.&quot;) The story is a rip off of Star Wars but what isn&apos;t and who cares? It&apos;s cool. The animation is superb. I said that earlier but I really do believe that it&apos;s better than Disney at some points. Certainly better than the average output at the time. It doesn&apos;t compare with today&apos;s graphics but it hasn&apos;t aged badly at all. The sountrack can sound a little too cheesy at times but the energy and verve of the film is there and it backs up the visuals with ease.\n\nIn the end it won&apos;t matter. This film won&apos;t mean a thing to anybody that doesn&apos;t know who Jazz, Bumblebee and Soundwave were to begin with. They won&apos;t watch it. They won&apos;t like it. And you know what? We don&apos;t care. Those of us that can name all five mebers of the Stunticons know better. They gave us what we wanted. And we remain eternally grateful.",

      "reviewBody": "I would be wrong if I said that Danny DeVito&apos;s films were made with full intent to capture the realisms of life, and it is because of his ability to portray an eccentric world (or relationship) that he is able to made the most original and entertaining characters known to film.\n\nFor example, although he didn&apos;t create the character Matilda, he was able to portray the girl with telekinetic ability in a very effective manner in the film of the same name. And also the characters in &apos;War of the Roses&apos; were thoroughly over-the-top, but it was because of this that the films directed by the short man were so entertaining.\n\n&apos;Death to Smoochy&apos; was no exception. It is because of the over-the-top characters that it is so funny. Edward Norton&apos;s character in particular is hilarious just because of the OTT reactions the &apos;atrocities&apos; of the world draw out of him, and the overly-nice attitude he oozes.\n\nThere are other things that create humour. The lines are hilariously witty and even the facial expressions created by some of the characters give the film replay value. So IS there anything wrong with it?\n\nI, personally, don&apos;t believe the dated storyline creates an obstruction, but I do feel that there is a problem with the dramatic character arcs. The biggest example of this is Robin Williams&apos; character who goes, in one scene, from being ridiculously hateful, to wanting nothing more than to save his ex-arch-rival. This is where the over-the-top obstructs believability, although it doesn&apos;t do enough to make me dislike the film even partially.\n\nThe film, although flawed only by the very dramatic character arcs, is thoroughly enjoyable, and DeVito sprinkles just enough dramatic camera angles to support the extremity of the storyline. It is a rare gem, battered at the box office, but very safe in my collection of favourite DVDs.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n-Stoate."

You really feel for this guy and Stewart has never been more convincing. I thought it would be a stretch to imagine her as a tough soldier and it is kind of surreal yet she manages to create a credible person out of the role. Her emotional distress as the contradictions of her job as camp guard begin to overwhelm her, is very powerful and a pleasure to watch.\n\nThis film totally changed my mind about Gitmo. Just because it makes you realize the awful possibility that totally innocent people may be stuck there, and that unlike any other prison in the USA, there is no way for them to appeal or for anybody to appeal on their behalf.\n\nThere must be some way to allow mistakes to be corrected. It&apos;s not right.\n\nIt&apos;s amazing to me that I never saw it that way. I just assumed that they were all hard core bad guys. But what if they aren&apos;t.\n\nThat would be a terrible fate, and this film really punches home how terrible it would be.",

I also gave it a ten at the vote. What I don&apos;t understand is why the majority of voters have given this movie a 7. With an average of 7.7 that almost the same as &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; on 7.4 - and that sucked(at least compared to this Oscar-nominated film). Maybe the reason it&apos;s so low is because the movie is made in a foreign language, so the American or non-Scandinavian speaking people won&apos;t understand all the points. This could very well be it. I just want future viewers of this IMDb-profile to know that there are others who also disagree on the grade given. And please reply to my comment if you agree.",

      "reviewBody": "In the South China Sea, the Argonautica, a luxury cruise ship, is enjoying its maiden voyage, with owner Simon (Anthony Heald) welcoming the rich and powerful to a major party in the middle of the ocean. Racing to the ship is John (Treat Williams), a captain-for-hire who&apos;s unsure about the pack of mercenaries he&apos;s working with, led by Hanover (Wes Studi), who are planning something nefarious for the Argonautica, unsettling crew member Joey (Kevin J. O&apos;Connor). Approaching the ship, it becomes clear the mercenaries are intending to rob the passengers and blow up the Argonautica, putting John in a difficult position of compliance without proper weaponry. However, the mission is disrupted by the arrival of a tentacled creature from the depths of ocean, and one that feeds on humans, using its pliable body and sea-based instinct to find victims, devouring everything it can find. Joined by pickpocket Trillian (Famke Janssen), John and Joey search for a way off the ship, trying to return to their damaged boat and get away from an unstoppable creature.\n\n1998&apos;s &quot;Deep Rising&quot; didn&apos;t have an easy time finding an audience during its initial theatrical release. It came out a year after &quot;The Relic&quot; (which delivered a similar monster-in-a-contained-area premise), a month after &quot;Titanic&quot; (which satiated audiences hungry to see a massive ship endure a slow destruction), and two weeks after &quot;Hard Rain&quot; (which also enjoyed some Jet Ski action in tight hallways). The planets didn&apos;t align for writer/director Stephen Sommers, but this noisy ode to B-movies of the past eventually found something of a following on home video and basic cable, and it&apos;s not hard to see why, with the helmer arranging plenty of mayhem, quips, and gore to delight those in the mood for something violent but cheeky. Though the true comedic value of &quot;Deep Rising&quot; is up for debate.",

It&apos;s full of high-stakes chaos, tech-fuelled paranoia, and a plot that spirals in the best kind of way.\n\nThe social commentary lands surprisingly well, with the AirDrop-as-menace angle tapping into real digital-age fears. And I loved the video game-esque text placements on screen - bold, stylised, and just the right kind of over-the-top.\n\nThe acting? A bit cringe, yes - but intentionally so. Meghann Fahy really leans into the melodrama, and Brandon Sklenar does a great job playing the increasingly bewildered date. Special shoutout to Violett Beane, whose dry delivery added just the right bite.\n\nBut a bone to pick: that child actor... GOD AWFUL. It&apos;s even more glaring when you think about someone like Owen Cooper in &apos;Adolescence&apos; - proof that you can cast a young actor who brings genuine weight to the screen. This kid just wasn&apos;t it. Still, if you&apos;re after a chaotic, neon-tinged thrill ride with something to say, &apos;Drop&apos; is a blast.",

It&apos;s not the greatest movie, and much of it is ludicrous, but it&apos;s packs a mean spirited, sleazy punch and keeps up a nice wintry atmosphere to keep you warm on a cold night, whether from the booze or the bullets. The film gets shat on a lot, especially by star Charlize Theron who famously said she only did it to work with Frankenheimer, but I think it&apos;s way more fun than people give it credit for. Ben Affleck back in the sordid chapter of bis career, plays a recently paroled convict who&apos;s on his way to meet his cell mate Nick&apos;s pen pal girlfriend, pretending to be him. Nice guy. She turns out to be a sweetheart in the form of Theron, and things look up for old Ben. Until, however, her volatile, psychotic gangster brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) shows up with a pack of thugs who have a notion to rob a casino that Nick used to work at, using him as an inside man. Only, he isn&apos;t Nick, and has no idea about the casino, forcing him to think on his feet and stall his way through the dangerous predicament. Sinise is a guy I&apos;m usually indifferent too, or bores me, but here he&apos;s a wide eyed, brutish lunatic and really has fun with the role. Theron is appropriately sexy and enigmatic, and there&apos;s standout work from three tough guy actors I really enjoy, playing Gabriel&apos;s henchman, sporting the delightful monikers Pug (Donal Logue), Merlin (Clarence Williams III) and Jumpy (Danny Trejo). They&apos;re like the three ill tempered elves to Gabriel&apos;s raving Santa, and steal the film. Dennis Farina plays loudmouth, dirtbag casino owner Jack Bangs, James Frain has a silly bit, and there&apos;s a demented cameo from Isaac Hayes (&quot;monsters in the gelatin!!&quot;). It&apos;s a loud, dumb flick and it knows it, but it also knows how to have a good time in style. Even when the third act erupts in a cascade of increasingly laughable double crosses and perplexing plot turns, it never stops having fun. Nothing says the holidays like jail time, casino robbery, backstabbing sociopaths, Santa suits and shotguns, and a little murder.",

Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were excellent in the first film and in a different league to the two actors in the roles as the young Harry and Lloyd (the guy cast as Lloyd does look like Carrey, except for the blue eyes). If there was ever going to be another film about these two characters it should have been a sequel starring the original pairing, instead we get this stinker. Dumb and Dumber hardly had an Oscar winning story line but gave us some great characters and a hatful of ball bouncingly funny gags, in the &apos;prequel&apos; the weak story collapses under the weight of even weaker jokes! So uninspired is this movie that there are even rehashes of jokes from the original, just done slightly differently but in a totally inept manner. Dumb and Dumber is a classic, this is a pile of steaming doggy doo doo&apos;s. Do yourself a favour stick with the Carrey film and avoid this limp fish at all costs.",

      "name": "Wonderful Experimental Documentary",
      "reviewBody": "Godfrey Reggio&apos;s Koyaanisqatsi (1983) is a film with no actors, no storyline, and no dialogue. The only things we see during the experimental documentary&apos;s 87 minutes are natural landscapes, images of cities, and real people going about their regular lives. Yet from the very beginning, when we see the title of the film appear in blood-red characters and hear the voice of a bass soloist chanting the title like an incantation, it is difficult not to be swept away in captivation.\n\nFilmed between 1977 and 1982, Reggio&apos;s film was noticed by directing great Francis Ford Coppola who eventually agreed to finance the project and give it chances for distribution. Minimalist composer Philip Glass was optioned to compose the score, and the result was, quite simply, astounding.\n\nKoyaanisqatsi is a collection of familiar images presented through tinted lenses (figuratively speaking). The experimental nature of the project can be seen in the reduced and augmented speeds of images, the use of carefully manipulated edits, and the use of Glass&apos;s score to create ambience. There are times when the film exhibits an almost surreal quality more indicative of a twisted, futuristic, dystopian sci-fi epic than of our mundane world.\n\nThis is, however, what makes Koyaanisqatsi so successful. In presenting our world in a disquieting, unflattering light, the film forces us to ruminate on our place in the universe and the consequences of many of our actions. The film starts with serene, austere images of mountains, oceans, and forests, and the repetitiveness of Glass&apos;s score does not bore us nor call attention to itself, but simply washes over us, entrancing us and instilling a sense of tranquility.\n\nIt is not long before the untainted images are replaced by nuclear power plants, highways, skyscrapers, rubble, fire and ash, and hoards of ant-like beings (humans, of course) scurrying through modern urbanity. Most times, humans are filmed at low-frame settings (making for faster speeds), and as a result, they seem frenzied, compulsively making their way through the cities in a manner that seems more conditioned than voluntary.\n\nGlass&apos;s score responds by heightening its tension and adding a semi-brutal nature to its repetitiveness. It is somewhat aversive, but at the same time exhibits a humorous and mocking quality. By cramming together so many images of humans behaving more like lab rats than higher, thinking beings and increasing the satirical nature of the score, the film invites us to consider just how depersonalized, mechanized, and out-of-control many aspects of our life are.\n\nThe conclusion of the film contrasts against the blackly comic nature of the previous section by instilling a sense of mourning and warning. As such, there is undoubtedly a political and environmental component inherent in this film, but this is the aspect that is, in my mind, most often misunderstood. Many critics (mostly detractors) have interpreted Koyaanisqatsi as a call to action, an invective that demands that we atone for the rape-like pillaging the human race has thrusted upon the natural environment. Following from this, these critics claim that the film&apos;s message is that we would enjoy the planet more if we were not here at all, thus presenting a contradiction, since we would not be here to enjoy it.\n\nIn my own personal view, the flaw here resides in viewing the film as a tirade and a call to action. I find Koyaanisqatsi very clearly to be not a cry for reform, but a demand for awareness and meditation. There is an inevitability in the actions of human beings and their disregard for the care of their surroundings, and the wonderful thing about this film is that it forces you to experience the consequences and at least take notice of what each of us is contributing. It does not let you get away with indifference and nonchalance.\n\nFor me, however, the political component is less important than the stylistic component, which is one near and dear to my heart: the use of music to enhance the forcefulness of images. I acknowledge the fact that some will not be able to stand the repetitiveness of Philip Glass&apos;s score (and it is very repetitive at some points). But if one can consider the motive behind the repetition, the music ceases to be oppressive and becomes sublime and entrancing. The score adds impact to an already stunning array of unforgettable images, the details of which I will not go into, so that one may see the film with fresh eyes.\n\nI saw Koyaanisqatsi for the first time at a performance in which the visuals were projected onto a giant screen with the soundtrack being supplied by Glass and his ensemble, who had come for a live performance. I had barely made it in time, since I struggled to find a parking space and was drenched from running in the rain. The moment the film started, however, all of the accumulated tensions in my body completely dissipated. It was not at all a cerebral experience, but an instinctive one in which I enjoyed the images and sounds for their own sakes.\n\nWhen I left the performance, I was in a hypnotic daze, transfixed by what I had just seen. My initial impressions haven&apos;t changed to this day. I loved this film, and while the political and environmental concerns it addresses are important, what really makes this film for me is the instinctive, visceral power of its images and sounds. Koyaanisqatsi maroons its audience in an alternate version of reality that sheds disturbing light on our lives, and yet at the same time, it produces an unforgettable cinematic experience that is pervasively engrossing.",

      "reviewBody": "First-time director Todd Field&apos;s &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; is a dark and disturbing film which is both a joy and a trial to sit through. Recent high school graduate Nick Stahl is having a little bit of fun during his last summer of freedom. He is seeing Marisa Tomei (Oscar-nominated), a woman twice his age who has young children and is separated from her shady husband (William Mapother in an appropriately chilly performance). Mother and music teacher Sissy Spacek (Oscar-nominated) worries about the relationship while father and town doctor Tom Wilkinson (also Oscar-nominated) shrugs off the partnership as a simple summer fling. When tragedy strikes, the simple life in Camden, Maine turns into chaos for all involved. &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; is one of the roughest films I have ever watched. It is a movie that is thought-provoking in the fact that everything seems so normal and yet darkness looms overhead for the primary characters in the film. The fact that the film takes place in rural Maine just makes it that much more scary. When one thinks of situations from the movie occurring, few think of a place like Maine. Much like &quot;Fargo&quot;, &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; shows that bad elements are everywhere, even in the most unlikely of places. However, be warned that &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; does not go for the black humor that &quot;Fargo&quot; went for. This is a film that will chill you to the bone. It is a must-see and easily one of the top five or ten films of 2001. 5 stars out of 5."

It&apos;s simply , okay. It&apos;s like watching people who are quite nice going through a storyline which is slightly familiar. No alarms and no surprises.\n\nI don&apos;t wish to add spoilers but one crucial scene which for me explains all the films weaknesses is this; Jennifer Westfeldt looks at herself in the mirror wearing a pair of heels, she decides she doesn&apos;t like them , so takes them off and puts on a pair of boots which zip up the side. She sits down on a bed and puts them on, one at a time, then once again she looks at herself in the mirror. This time she is happy with her choice. This is shot in real time, and if memory serves correctly without an edit. Takes about 45 secs. When you write , direct and star [ especially when you haven&apos;t been in a movie for a while] ,screen time must be very exciting but filming yourself looking at yourself , pretty explains the whole movie for me.\n\nThere&apos;s a good reason Kristen Wigg features on the poster, Bridesmaids made millions, she&apos;s funny and has got game.\n\nBut imagine being in the marketing meeting where you had to explain to Jennifer why her face wouldn&apos;t be appearing in any of the advertisements for the film she wrote, directed and starred in. Ouch, that must have been a tough day for her.",

I vaguely remember this news story back from 2013, and frankly the subject matter itself does not lure me in; instead I tune in because of Jodie Foster and Annette Benning. So that proves that those two acting legends are a wise choice for this production. Annette Benning&apos;s commitment to portray Diana Nyad with all her might almost equals the level of commitment and almost-insanity that Nyad herself exhibited during her quest to do the long-distance swim in her 60s. Jodie Foster further adds that extra layer of poignancy with her intense performance. I am glad for having seen the movie, but this feels more like a solid, uplifting documentary that happens to be reenacted, as opposed to a movie made to entertain you.",

Done with much comedy and funny action (and a little bit of insignificant drama), this one is a film that can be watched again and again and still be an absolute treat. The film has a story, and the greatest thing about it is that it actually does not even matter. This film is made for fun, and succeeds thoroughly for that purpose.\n\nAnd what does it have to work as much as it did? Well, it has a Shahrukh Khan (sorry, The Shahrukh Khan), two cool youngsters (Zayed Khan and Amrita Rao), a sexy and classy chemistry teacher (Sushmita Sen), a hilarious spit-spraying teacher (Satish Shah), another funny elderly teacher (Bindu), and a motherly, warm Kirron Kher. \n\nShahrukh is as always great and is fairly restrained in this role, Sushmita is damn too hot to handle, Zayed and Amrita suit their parts, Kirron is lovable as usual, Satish Shah and Bindu will have you floored, and Sunil Shetty will annoy you as he does in most of his films. \n\nThe film has an amazing soundtrack with many catchy songs composed by Anu Malik. It has a twisted, messy and senseless story that manages to provide utmost fun and pastime, and it has many great and heart-warming moments. It flows very well throughout with all the nice songs and the rather humorous proceedings. \n\nFilms are made mainly to entertain us. This film does not take itself too seriously and it is not to be taken seriously. It has some inexplicable and genuine sense of fun, and as such, can be rightfully called a successful, special and very profound Hindi entertainment.",

Sure the plot doesn&apos;t make sense or it doesn&apos;t have John Cusack, but who gives a f*ck! you get more of Craig Robinson, Rob Courddry and Clark Duke, who let&apos;s be honest provided most of the laughs from the original. Sure it&apos;s more crude and it may not appeal to all those artsy fartsy critics who are whining about the movie not being PC, but if you want a good stoner movie to watch with the guys and enjoy something without taking it too seriously, watch it! I think it is on par with the first and has been unfairly judged. Compared to most comedy sequels, that always do the same thing as the first (hangover sequels), at least this went in a completely over the top direction that was more like a bunch of comedy skits than an actual movie. Overall, I thought it was hilarious and a definite guilty pleasure. Sure it won&apos;t appeal to everyone, and its not supposed too. Obviously for a movie like this you don&apos;t expect much just a lot of laughs and this is definitely a goofy stoner comedy best enjoyed under the influence. \n\n7/10",

It was incredible how they made such a lighthearted movie with such dark comedy. Think Secondhand Lions meets Forrest Gump, I know, it&apos;s worth it though. The main Character was so nonchalant it was endearing. His care free attitude was refreshing and easy to watch. The supporting cast is what really makes the movie for me though. I don&apos;t know who any of these actors are, but the casting Director did such a good job. They all melded so well together. They fed off each other&apos;s presence and they were able to share scenes extremely well with each other. It was very play-esque in that regard. \n\nHaving read some of the other reviews I will simply say, if you take this movie too seriously you&apos;ve already lost the point. If you look for flaws you&apos;re bound to find them, however, it&apos;s such a fun movie. It&apos;s light, it&apos;s dark, and personally, just a funny movie.",

      "reviewBody": "For about the last 3 years, i have special interest with Indian movies. I found out that Indian movie is worth to watch, the idea of the story is original, based on India everyday life, problem, dilemma. I know Vinglish was something when I read about the plot. This is not about romance between two countries, love which separated by time and distance, unapproved love. This about a good housewife who was very loyal and serve her family entirely. Her name is Shashi. She had side job as a laddu maker (Indian traditional cake). But one thing which become a family joke all the time was her inability to speak English. A very obvious moment how embarrassed her daughter, Sapna, with her was when she should replaced her husband in school meeting (reports day). This the new information to me, in some schools in India, the daily language is English. Sashi unable talk in English and asked the teacher talked in Hindi, Sapna glared at her and refused talk to her on their way returned home. Not only Sapna, her husband, Sathish somehow disregarded her ability as a laddu maker only. \n\nSashi asked by his sister to help her prepared her wedding&apos;s daughter in US, Sashi willing to help, but the consequence was she must leave by herself. The others family member would joined her later. Sashi was afraid because she unable speak English and this is the first time she left her home all by herself. But eventually she left. With full of happiness meeting her sister and nephew, Radha, she&apos;s still bothered about the embarrassment of her daughter and what her husband said. \n\nOne day she saw an ad about learning English fluently on 6 weeks! Sashi showed her interest and memorized the number. She sign up herself for the program secretly. In this course she meet a cute French guy, Laurent, who helped her in the other day. He fancy her which was just too visible! Sashi enjoyed the class very much and followed the lesson well. She gained confidence and decided to follow the class till the end of the program. But Radha found out Sashi walked with Laurent, and asked who was he. Sashi revealed she took an English course and Radha supported her. Will Sashi finish her English course? Which one Sathi choose, Sathis or Laurent? You should find it by yourself by watching this humor-drama movie! \n\nMany scenes become my favorites, conversation between Amitabachan and American Immigration officer is one of. Gauri Shinde as a director, was very rigorous present it in a smart way, which is mostly I found in Hollywood movie. As an Indian movie, i gave you all my thumbs! :)",

      "reviewBody": "Pedro&apos;s back and Madrid has gone wild. With the release of his 17th feature film, &quot;Los Abrazos Rotos&quot; (Broken Embraces) Almodovár tells the tale of a blind film director (Lluis Omar) and how he came to lose not only his sight, but also the love of his life (Penelope Cruz). The film is by no means a departure from the Spaniard&apos;s typical traits, with the picture employing the usual Almodóvar fodder  love, lies, tears, melodrama, comedy - to great effect. The film journeys between the past and the present, and interweaves diverse stories and viewpoints, to construct a fascinating drama full of twists and turns. The acting is terrific and there are many &apos;in-jokes&apos; involving subtle references to previous Almodóvar films, with the picture rounded off nicely by a soundtrack produced by the ever-brilliant Alberto Iglesias (featuring original music alongside tracks by Uffie, Cat Power and Can).\n\nMy only gripe would be the film&apos;s length, clocking up over 2 hours  a factor which is noticeable given that the film&apos;s storyline does seem to run out of steam after the 90-minute mark. But that minor complaint should not detract from the fact that Almodóvar has demonstrated himself to be one of the most individual and consistent film-makers in modern cinema. It must be said that &apos;Los Abrazos Rotos&apos; is not the tour-de-force that some fans may have hoped for and falls short of eclipsing what in my opinion was his career high  Hable Con Ella (Talk to Her). Nevertheless, Almodóvar delivers a very engaging film which is sure to become another hit, and will no doubt earn more accolades for the man who can deservedly call himself Spain&apos;s most successful film-maker of all time.",

Those who appreciate great acting in a movie won&apos;t be disappointed. (Did you ever see a movie Edward Norton was in that he wasn&apos;t absolutely great..well, maybe a couple that he may have did for the just the money..lol. His absolute best was &quot;American History X&quot;) The movie itself moved along a pace that one keeps looking at his/her watch waiting for the ending. And the ending, again, is the latest Hollywood type...it sucks. Storyline was interesting but never got you interested to a point where one found it entertaining. This was a 98% dialog movie. You could be listening to this entire movie and never watch the video portion and understand the entire script. I am a big fan of Norton and Jovovich but this movie I could have passed on.",

The film seems so realistic, the brutality, the dialogues, the places, the characters, it&apos;s all so well adapted to the kind of movie that Chopper is. The acting is really amazing, especially from Eric Bana, who plays Chopper. This man has the talent to make every single feeling of his character visible, and realistic.  The violence, while being pretty graphic and brutal, isn&apos;t gratuitous or exaggerated (except for some scenes with too much blood letting).  The violence &quot;hits&quot; the viewer, just like he was feeling the pain, it&apos;s very well reproduced.  The character of Chopper is interesting, as a man who&apos;s trying to be a real tough criminal, but still has some feelings...it&apos;s Natural Born Killers with nuances...With funny moments, great acting, nicely-written scenario and one very interesting character, Chopper delivers that: Dark humor, attaching characters, great scenario, violence (for the people who like it), and it&apos;s a very nice movie. Eric Bana has a lot of future in acting...and Andrew Dominik is a great director that should definitely continue in this business.  Chopper is very enjoyable.  I give it 8/10."

I was 12, after all!!\n\nRecently watched the film again for the first time in at least 15 years. I was blown away by the final segment, it&apos;s truly a classic which really scared the stuffing outta me. That evil little girl who takes Polaroids of everything freaked me out to no end. For me, it&apos;s the only segment in which the quality of the writing matches the direction and visuals from beginning to end.\n\nI saw the original episode upon which Joe Dante&apos;s (3rd) segment is based when I was spending the night at my friend&apos;s house in 4th grade. It, too, really frightened me. I remember thinking to myself how hopeless the situation was-- if you even TRIED to not think bad thoughts about Anthony, you would end up thinking them, and he could still get you!! And didn&apos;t he &quot;wish someone away to the cornfield&quot;?? Man, that&apos;s some serious freakiness.\n\n I thought the design of that segment in the movie was incredible, I&apos;ll never forget the mom holding the fishbowl, or the ferocious rabbit creature, or what happens to Ethel (&quot;Run, Ethel....!&quot;) But the ending is truly atrocious and almost ruins what has come before.\n\nWhat can I say about the other two segments? Better scripts were needed in order to make them work. And in the case of &quot;Kick the Can&quot;, sticking more closely to the original episode would have given it more impact. (Not to mention firing Steven Spielberg.)And it&apos;s sad seeing Vic Morrow in his final role-- I&apos;ll always think of him as the sadistic coach in THE BAD NEWS BEARS, which is one of my all-time favorites.\n\nAll in all, a very uneven movie which improves steadily as it goes along. 6/10."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; is a film made by Dreamworks apparently with the intention of showing Julian Assange as an egocentric villain and seems to manipulate the truth about the role of the Weakleaks. On the contrary, his unfaithful and ambitious partner Daniel Domscheit-Berg a.k.a. Daniel Schmitt is depicted like a rational adviser and the hero, destroying the whistleblower information and data of the Weakleaks to protect the &quot;innocent spies and informers&quot;. The film is based on a book written by Daniel Domscheit-Berg; therefore totally partial about the truth without showing the side of Julian Assange. I am not expert in this subject and I have just the common sense of reading and listening to the news about Julian Assange and the Wikileaks. But the film seems to be manipulative and depicting one side of the truth only. Therefore as a documentary, it is worthless; however a thriller, it is engaging and has good performances. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Quinto Poder&quot; (&quot;O Quinto Poder&quot;)",

Certainly everyone&apos;s experiences are different but some things, the initial disorientation, the difficulties and pleasure of adapting to a new and very different set of friends, the joys of eventual acceptance and adaption of a new routine; these are probably universal. This film depicts all of this very well.\n\nThe Spanish Apartment rings especially true for me. Almost ten years ago I moved from NYC to Antwerp for one year then on to Barcelona, where I am living still. I was a bit older than the film&apos;s characters (late 20 &apos;s) but my experience was eerily similar. I lived just blocks away from their apartment, in Raval, and recognized many of the streets and locales. Myself, a Slovak girl I was dating, three male apartment mates from Bolivia, France and Italy. I made tons of expat friends from all over Europe (many of whom departed long ago) and eventually Spanish friends as well.\n\nI&apos;m older now and settled down but watching this, I was overwhelmed with nostalgia and wished that I could travel back in time if only to relive one of those glorious weekends.\n\nIf you&apos;ve never done anything like this watching The Spanish Apartment may be the next best thing. \n\nThe Barcelona tourist office should probably pay me for this."

      "reviewBody": "A Woody Allen written and directed film that does not include him in a single frame.  It may seem strange, but it&apos;s true.  Allen&apos;s &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; deals with a struggling stage writer (John Cusack) who is so desperate to get one of his plays on Broadway in the 1920s that he reluctantly enlists the help of the local mafia crime lord to fund the play. Of course there is a large stipulation.  The crime lord&apos;s girl must be in the play (hilariously played by Jennifer Tilly in an Oscar-nominated role). Needless to say she&apos;s terrible and Cusack struggles with her in the play. However, he has booked A-list actress Dianne Wiest (in her second Oscar-winning role) who is an alcoholic who has seen better days in her career.  Tilly&apos;s bodyguard (Chazz Palminteri, also in an Oscar-nominated role) sees the play rehearsed firsthand and gives Cusack some directions on the project that Cusack cannot refuse.  Palminteri is street smart and knows how people really talk, while Cusack is so educated that his words make no sense to the normal audience.  This film is what &quot;The Godfather&quot; would have been like if Allen had directed it.  The screenplay is outstanding and Allen&apos;s direction has rarely been better.  Cusack is fun and hilarious, but it is the supporting cast that makes the movie work.  Other than the aforementioned Oscar-nominated actors, there are great turns by several others.  Mary-Louise Parker, Tracy Ullman, Jim Broadbent, Jack Warden, Rob Reiner, Harvey Feinstein, and Joe Viterelli are all superb in well-calculated supporting roles.  4 out of 5 stars."

      "reviewBody": "What You Should Know – Set in the 90&apos;s it&apos;s believable that Brandy is an eighteen year old virgin. As a straight-A student she&apos;s always known what to do except when she gets the chance encounter to have sex with her crush. But she&apos;s devised a plan to pop her cherry by engaging in every sexual act possible before her first semester in college. With the support of her best friends and her slutty older sister, Brandy is well on her way from always getting straight-A&apos;s to having her first O. \n\nWhat Works – The 90&apos;s soundtrack with all the sexed up songs including &quot;Me So Horney,&quot; &quot;O.P.P.&quot; and &quot;Let&apos;s Talk About Sex.&quot; It&apos;s also fun to see Brandy check off each item while she&apos;s in the act. Her best friend notes there are things on the list that she hasn&apos;t even done and that&apos;s awesome. There are things on that list that I haven&apos;t even heard of and that&apos;s sad.\n\nWhat Doesn&apos;t Work – The adorable dweeb looking to lose his/her virginity is a bit overdone, but it&apos;s nice that Aubrey Plaza has opted not to wear the signature ponytail and over-sized glasses. While she&apos;s the typical straight-A type, she&apos;s not insecure in who she is. Having sex is just another thing to cross off her long list of accomplishments. \n\nWhat I Thought – Worth the Admission In a day and age where slutty teens run rapid it&apos;s nice to recall, not too long ago, when they didn&apos;t which makes The To Do List something you must do this summer. Keep in mind that while it&apos;s cute it&apos;s best to wear a condom; this is the kind of movie that is so vulgar you could catch an STD right in the middle of all the laughter."

      "reviewBody": "I can understand that many history buffs would be disappointed with the movie. Okay, it is historical inaccurate, but it&apos;s just entertainment. The same with any novel which introduces fictional characters and imaginary or altered historical events. An example: In one of the best movies of all time (at least for me)Ben-Hur, the main character, played by Charles Heston, when almost dying of thirst, is given water by Jesus. Later on he tries to help Jesus carry the cross. Bible followers could be appalled by this since it never appear nor in he Bible or in the Christian traditions. This is very common with all historical novels or movies based on real life characters. Producers and directors play for their public at a given time. As in the movies of World War ll, Japanese where demons and all Nazis murderous monsters; in this day and age, anyone from the East or Middle East wearing a cloth around his head or a burka, is a fanatical zealot. As we know (or should know), that is not necessarily true.\n\nSo in the movie we have at hand I can safely say that is a very entertaining movie, with excellent photography, breathtaking landscapes, good action, excellent acting and an overall a very interesting story. What really bothered me was the almost quantum jumps it makes in its story line. How this impoverished boy managed to get accepted into a prestigious and exclusive medical school without even knowing the language? Furthermore, it is never explained how he managed to have the resources to live quite a lavish in this progressive city. Probably you&apos;ll have to read the book to find a plausible explanation. In the other hand, I cannot discard this movie because of its glitches. It has lots of other aspects going for it; specially that it made me feel good; it had that old time spectacular grandeur that has been lacking in today boisterous blockbusters.",

After a bar fight, pressure builds to put his Pops into a home. He resists and takes Pops out to his cabin. Unbeknownst to him, one of his log truck drivers, Weston, is transporting drugs with Hallett. They crash on a snowy road and rush to hide the drug stash in Joe&apos;s shack. The incompetent pair&apos;s drug boss Kassen (Garret Dillahunt) leads the gang to recover his drugs the next day and it becomes a deadly cat and mouse game.\n\nThe first half is a bit slow. It spends too much time with the family. Introducing Joe as a family man should not take this much screen time. His father&apos;s dementia feels like a side plot point. It could have come in handy to instigate the standoff but the ignition is more problematic than that. There are different ways for Joe to ignite the confrontation. Splitting the drug stash in half is one of the inferior options. He should probably try to give it all to Kassen hoping that he would leave on his own accord. I doubt Kassen could ever leave the cabin without securing all of his drugs. Joe&apos;s plan is an unlikely pipe dream. His father&apos;s dementia could have been used as a catalyst for everything. The daughter&apos;s jacket is too bright purple. A smart man would turn it inside out for better camouflage. Joe ends up using too many special weapons. It&apos;s a little too Home Alone. I do like Momoa, Dillahunt, and Lang. They fit the setting and the manhunt plot. The cabin is probably too nice and the production couldn&apos;t afford to do much damage. They would probably be better off with a rundown shack where the bad guys can shoot the hell up. They could burn it down for real rather than the obvious fake fires. The second half does have some cat and mouse fun. This is good enough.",

      "reviewBody": "I really don&apos;t get the negative reviews for this movie. I&apos;m in my forties, so is my husband. Our children are three and eleven. We all loved this movie. I&apos;ll buy the DVD.\n\nI liked this movie as well as A Bug&apos;s Life, if not better. Why? The message that it&apos;s okay to be yourself and that you don&apos;t have to simply accept bullying is delivered in a more laid-back way. A Bug&apos;s Life and Toy Story, by comparison, are frenetic.\n\nThe actors voices and characterization are terrific. All in all, I think the visuals at the end of the film - sort of a funky, hieroglyphic narrative - help to sum up this film&apos;s appeal or lack of appeal, depending on the nature of the viewer. If you genuinely prefer faster-paced, more &quot;in-your-face&quot; type of movies (and I realize that most American film viewers do these days), then you will have to acclimate a little to this film. But not much. It&apos;s plenty busy.\n\nWhat it also is, however, is charming. Toy Story was charming. So was the first Shrek, in its own quirky, slightly perverse way. The Ant Bully, in my family&apos;s opinion (and we go to a lot of movies), was just what we needed for a Friday night of family entertainment. We had some really good laughs, enjoyed being together, and left feeling upbeat. The audience seemed to enjoy this movie very much. There was a lot of laughter and many people stayed to watch the colorful visuals at the end.\n\nIf you don&apos;t like this movie, then perhaps you need to learn to kick back and relax a little more often. We found it to be well worth viewing and it will certainly receive a lot of travel time viewing in our car once it&apos;s released on DVD. I saw that Tom Hanks was an Executive Producer. Thanks, Tom.",

      "reviewBody": "Body Double is directed by Brian De Palma, he also co-writes the screenplay with Robert J. Avrech. It stars Craig Wasson, Melanie Griffith, Gregg Henry, Deborah Shelton, Guy Boyd and Dennis Franz. Music is by Pino Donaggio and cinematography by Stephen H. Burum.\n\nBrian De Palma continued his crusade to push buttons of the sensitive whilst homaging his hero Alfred Hitchcock, with this cheeky, garish, sleazy thriller. Even when moving away from Hitch like movies, he created a storm with Scarface (1983), so the critics of 1984 wondered if a return to suspense thriller territory would put the director back on an even cinematic keel? Not a bit of it! The reaction to Body Double was ridiculously over the top, apparently a misogynistic homage to the porn industry, with exploitation gore thrown in for good (bad) measure, Body Double was the devil&apos;s spawn in the eyes of critics. The public? Not so much, film was a sure fire hit at the box office.\n\nOf course today it seems all very tame, where not even a simulated drilling killing can raise the temperature of the audience, or that frank sexual language and bare bodies no longer makes cinema goers blush. On reflection now it&apos;s easy to view De Palma&apos;s movie as a visionary piece of work, a film gently poking the ribs of Hollywood and the MPAA, and as was always the case with his 70s and 80s work, he was a director who easily elicited a response from his audience. And with his box of cinematic tricks still impressive before he became over reliant on them, Body Double is a fascinatingly lurid viewing experience.\n\nThat it&apos;s Vertigo and Rear Window spliced together is a given, but that doesn&apos;t make it a bad film, besides which it bears the De Palma stamp as well, undeniably so. Plot finds Jake Scully (Wasson), a struggling actor with claustrophobia, thrust into a world of murder, obsession, deceit and paranoia, for when he house sits for a newly acquired friend, he spies a sexy lady through the telescope apparently being stalked by an odd looking Native American. To reveal more would spoil the fun of anyone watching for the first time, but suffice to say that Jake has entered the realm where neo-noir protagonists wander around wondering how and why they are in this mess.\n\nIt&apos;s pulpy and pappy, but in the best ways possible, and unlike many other films made by directors who ventured into similar territory, it&apos;s never boring (hello Sliver). Cast are appropriately cartoonish or animated, the twists fun if not hard to see coming, and with De Palma&apos;s visual panache cosying up nicely with Donaggio&apos;s musical score, Body Double is fine entertainment brought to us by a director with a glint in his eye. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Jubei, a rouge samurai who&apos;s wandering the land becomes involved unwillingly in the battle between an evil group of supernatural demon warriors known as the Eight Devils of Kimon and the country&apos;s government. After a town was wiped out overnight by a plague, so the eight devils could get in to get perform a certain mysterious task. Jubei soon is joined by a poisonous female samurai known as Kagero to find out the Devils&apos; business is in this town, after one of them wipe out her ninja team and nearly her if it hadn&apos;t been for Jubei. He also encounters someone of the past, who he thought that he already had killed. \n\nSo I&apos;ve gone back to my roots when anime was a childhood favourite of mine, but this one isn&apos;t for kids. I loved this flick when I was in my early teens, so watching it now was such a nostalgia trip and surprisingly it still holds up exceptionally well. The popular worldwide hit &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;, which was directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri (who brought us the excellent &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot;) paves way for a maturely slick, extremely violent and intensely erotic outlook. Everything about it comes thick and fast. It frenetically exploits the blood sprayed violence like a running tap, but still never loses that beautifully tender edge that seeps into many of the situations. The compelling premise isn&apos;t a mind-bender, although a bit jaded, but its simple origins only enhance the taut lay out and poignantly dark array of blisteringly out-there conflicts. It&apos;s surprising in it developments and you&apos;re left amazed by the film&apos;s personality and unique world that&apos;s created. It vividly captures the period of this atmospheric world. They&apos;re such an imaginatively diverse barrage of dynamic characters, with the likes of the rock-build demon to the hunchback whose hump are a wasp nest and a snake lady who can actually shed her skin. This gave it a real eastern mythological state and only proves that the bad guys had the most fun. The story might feel like its there only to set up one spirited confrontation after another and really it is. But the story-telling element is effectively defined, as most of the main players get enough time to mould there own back story and present their significance to where it could be heading. Jubei makes a cool anti-hero and Kagero fits nicely along side him. The skillful animation has class, agility, originality and distinguishing details making its way into these stunningly pristine visuals. An aggressively crisp sounding FX makes the experience a whole lot more impressive with such a wide range and the oriental twang found in the eerily mystic music score makes this presentation more brooding in its blinding passion and checkered emotion. Kawajiri faced no restrictions here, and was free to come up with an illustriously innovative and majestic anime piece that works in every frame. \n\n&quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; is more highly involving than you would believe.

The rest of the leading cast was Dan Aykroyd, the manager of an insurance firm in which Allen works, and Helen Hunt, Aykroyd&apos;s secretary who always has time to insult Allen (if you know anything about old films, you&apos;ll probably realize just how close these two are, and I don&apos;t mean just in the office).\n\nThe film follows this insurance firm as they all try to search for a bunch of lost jewels, not realizing that someone in the office is borderline guilty. The group goes to a nightclub to celebrate Wallace Shawn&apos;s 50th birthday, and the entertainment is a &quot;magician&quot; who ends up putting both Allen and Hunt under hypnosis and convinces them to do his will and also that they&apos;re in love with each other, with only the utterance of two words: &quot;Madagascar&quot; and &quot;Constantinople&quot; (gee, it&apos;d be a shame if these two words were uttered later in the movie to advance the plot).",

      "reviewBody": "Stephen King&apos;s Apt Pupil, which is part of the novella collection Different Seasons (alongside the stories that inspired The Shawshank Redemption and Stand by Me), is a valid example of how you don&apos;t need things to be openly supernatural to have a good scary tale: a &quot;human&quot; incarnation of pure evil will do just as fine, and few images are more effective than those of the atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis during WWII.\n\nOkay, minor correction: WWII has virtually nothing to do with this story, given it takes place in 1984. There is a Nazi involved, though: his name is Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen), but he&apos;s been living quite peacefully in your average American neighborhood under the name Arthur Denker. However, a young boy named Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro from the Grisham-inspired The Client) manages to uncover the old man&apos;s real identity thanks to some thorough research and tells him about the discovery. The unexpected thing is, Todd doesn&apos;t want to report Dussander to the police. What he really wants is to learn everything - and he repeatedly emphasizes the word &quot;everything&quot; - about the former Nazi&apos;s work under Hitler&apos;s regime. Soon enough, the perverse bond between the two starts affecting the boy&apos;s grades and behavior, and Dussander isn&apos;t unaffected either: somewhere deep inside lies the old Nazi, and that part of his personality would like to come out and play.\n\nThe film&apos;s screenplay sticks quite faithfully to the basic idea of King&apos;s story and reproduces some of the most famous scenes verbatim (except for one moment of animal cruelty, which had to be softened), although a few subplots are excised, presumably for the sake of length and pace. The downside of that is an occasional lack of detail, especially when it comes to the development of Renfro&apos;s character. Director Bryan Singer, who obviously found himself in an uncomfortable position to begin with, having to live up to the success of The Usual Suspects, makes up for this flaw by constructing a genuinely tense and unnerving atmosphere, adding to the moral ambiguity by highlighting the homosexual subtext already present in the book (when Todd tells Dussander to f*ck himself, the latter replies: &quot;My dear boy, can&apos;t you see? We&apos;re f*cking each other.&quot;).\n\nActing-wise, the limelight is inevitably placed on the leading duo, even if the supporting cast, which includes fine character actors like Bruce Davison and Elias Koteas, is quite strong (with the exception of David &quot;Ross&quot; Schwimmer, who isn&apos;t entirely at ease in a serious role). Renfro&apos;s performance is solid and captivating enough, but like his character he is completely overshadowed by the superb, unsettling McKellen, who inhabits the role of Dussander with his usual Shakespearean grandeur. Case in point: the unforgettable moment when the old man is forced to wear an old SS uniform Todd got his hands on. McKellen carries out the assignment with the dignity of a great tragic thespian, nailing the scene as one of the essential samples of his film career.\n\nApt Pupil distances itself from The Shawshank Redemption and Stand by Me in that it isn&apos;t as accomplished, most notably when it comes to the inevitable book/film comparison. Then again, it tells a much darker story, which asks the audience to root for a psychotic teenager and an aging Nazi. Flawed it may be, but it certainly is interesting (not to mention carried by an astounding McKellen). It is indeed a different season.",

This is certainly a very strange, bizarre yet unique love story/thriller that asks a lot of deep questions but sadly none are really answered due to the lackluster ending. The first hour is certainly hard hitting stuff with some eerie atmosphere that goes a long way. Nicole Kidman turns in another brilliant and incredibly brave performance, which should have gotten more attention but I guess it was overlooked due to the controversy surrounding a couple scenes including the one with her and the kid in the bathtub together. What I enjoyed best was that the film played out as something from real life and not B.S. we see in a movie. The characters are all very mature, they think and act the way people do in life and not in some normal movie. Danny Huston and Lauren Bacall co-star. Anne Heche is also very good in a role I didn&apos;t even know it was her at first."

Like the bird fight one\n\nThis movie was very boring at times but it was also sorta funny at times too.\n\nThis movie makes me appreciate the simplicity of the first movie\n\nThis movie was trying to be home alone two but ended up being home alone three These movies really do feel like home alone with a overweight cop\n\nAlso we get like no mall cop stuff until like an hour into the movie.\n\nThe soundtrack wasn&apos;t good because I don&apos;t remember a single song they had in the movie. If any.\n\nThey basicly ditched the entire cast of the first movie except for 2 characters\n\nAnd the story isn&apos;t creative at all. They just go to Vegas for some speech and Paul&apos;s daughter gets aceepted to college.\n\nSpeaking of the college storyline i didn&apos;t really like it. Plus I feel like this movie would be exactly the same if they didn&apos;t add that plotline in\n\nThere&apos;s a lot more nit pics I have, but I don&apos;t want this video to be too long so we won&apos;t get into too much\n\nLet&apos;s just say this movie was a pretty big downgrade from the first movie\n\nBut I will rate this movie a not so solid 5/10 really the only positive I had with this movie was it was pretty funny if not funnier than the first to me.\n\nOverall it was just a very bland and boring sequel I do not recommend this movie at all. I hope there not making a mall cop 3 because they should have made a MALL COP 2.",

I&apos;ve been one on a professional level for over ten years, both as a writer and performer.  And I LOVED this movie (apologies to all those pretentious &apos;serious&apos; musicians out there).  I enjoyed my theatrical viewing and I have watched my DVD several times.\n\nIs MR. HOLLAND&apos;S OPUS musically accurate?  No, of course not, no more so than STAR TREK paying attention to factual science and the laws of physics. But for the most part, nobody other than most of us ego-driven, high horse bound musician types will ever know it.\n\nDesigned to have a broad appeal outside the aforementioned musically inclined crowd?  Yes, but then so is nearly every movie to come out of Hollywood.  It has to be palatable to a certain degree, and I believe that the much maligned &quot;Play the sunset&quot; scene is far more entertaining than having Mr. Holland give us lengthy exposition on the proper articulation and technique that goes into playing a given instrument.\n\nAnd if I hear one more poster scream about Mr. Holland&apos;s &apos;opus&apos; only being ten minutes long (the &quot;It took him a lifetime to write THIS?&quot; mantra) I think I&apos;ll scream.  Did it ever occur to anybody that what we heard was only a small part of a much larger work?  Most classical and semi-classical pieces occur in (get ready) MOVEMENTS!  It&apos;s entirely possible that we only heard the prologue to a much larger piece.  Think outside the box, people.\n\nAs for the quality of the piece itself, I found it to be acceptable, if not the most dynamic piece of work I&apos;ve ever heard.  But seeing as how we had been hearing snippets of this piece THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE, I can&apos;t say that I was so overwhelmingly let down as some of our more &apos;educated and refined&apos; musician types that have posted here.\n\nSure, there were some flaws.  Ms. Headly is not the greatest actress in the world, and beside Dreyfuss she&apos;s downright embarrassing.  William Macy&apos;s character is so cliched that it warrants no further discussion.  The whole subplot with Rowena and her romantic interest in Mr. Holland ran about ten minutes too long.  And the ending bit where the arts funding gets cut seemed a little too political.\n\nBut overall, a great film, surely one of Dreyfuss&apos; best, and one of my favorite films.\n\nI&apos;m a musician.  And I liked it.  So sue me...."

Why do they always have to characters which are bumbling, drunk, part deaf, have seizures and don&apos;t even speak properly. Jackie Shroff (Charan Grover) needed to be robbed, as he was so foolish that he couldn&apos;t even recognize Nandu as his son&apos;s double. The songs were too many, movie could easily have been cut short by at least 45 minutes. Poor direction and acting. Boman Irani otherwise such a good actor, lost on count of poor script. Vivan Shah was miscast in the movie. I don&apos;t think there is negative stars given for any movie, but to this one I give -10 stars. I am so glad did not watch this movie in the theaters."

In the summer of 1977, paranoia eclipsed disco fever as the so-called .44 Killer murdered six and injured seven, all while keeping in contact with columnist Jimmy Breslin (whose comments bookend this movie).  Not the kind of events to revisit in these days of the easily offended, and seeing Lee&apos;s claustrophobic take on Berkowitz in his deranged apartment is almost enough deter you from visiting the Big Apple.\n\nThe focus of the movie is an insular community of Italian-Americans. Mistrust rules the roost: the only thing close-knit about them is an occasional cheesy tank-top.  Fear and conformity underpin the set-pieces upon which Lee thrives, from cops meeting a Mafia chief (Ben Gazarra) to a half-hearted Studio 54-style orgy.  John Leguizamo thrives when passing himself off as John Travolta, but his marriage is a hollow sham.  His quest for redemption hinges on saving punk friend Ritchie (Adrien Brody) from both himself and the lynchmob they grew up with.\n\nSummer of Sam has invited comparisons with Do the Right Thing, on account of its portrayal of the simmering tensions building up to horrendous violence. Yet the lifestyles on show throughout make it closer to Scorsese&apos;s Mean Streets, albeit balanced by several strong female leads, notably Mira Sorvino.  At 142 minutes it has stretched the attention span of some viewers and reviewers, but as the closing credits roll Lee has got us to care about the characters as each boils over.  Ditching the irksome music video/sitcom visuals - even at a Late-term Abortions gig, with Ritchie on guitar - this is Spike Lee&apos;s most mature joint to date.\n\nGraham Barnfield"

The ambient for all scenarios is done pretty well too (Swamps, cities, forrest)\n\nStorywise This is what i liked the most because it&apos;s not that dumb for an illumination movie, it has drama and funny moments throughout the entire run, but nothing too deep, just enough to be entertaining.\n\nI would say if you go alone or with your family you&apos;ll have a good time.",

The music in the movie is one of its strongest points, every song is carried out with excitement, yet the songs don&apos;t take away from the plot of the movie at all, they enhance the scenes they are complementing.

I can watch Jason Voorhies slice a victim&apos;s head off with a machete while eating a 3-course meal, but watching a room full of blind children crawl all over a floor and cut themselves with broken glass is pretty damn disgusting to me.

Soon after he moves into the house, strange occurrences begin.\n\nThis is one of those horror movies that can be scary without being bloody and gory. It simply relies on atmosphere and frightening, but subtle images to deliver its chills, and it works. I will never be able to understand that &quot;R&quot; rating mainly because there is only very mild profanity and there is no blood or gore.

      "reviewBody": "The first Godzilla film I ever saw was the 90s Hollywood blockbuster and having seen a few since, I understand why that was so widely hated.\n\nOG Godzilla is clearly a metaphor for the dangers of nuclear power. Coming from the one country to have suffered the rough end of that it has a huge significance.\n\nShin Godzilla has lots to say too. There are themes about international relations, Japan&apos;s history and its anxieties about its place in the modern world.\n\nGojira himself doesn&apos;t have a huge amount of screen time but what we do get is a very different monster than we&apos;ve seen before. Evolving and mutating before our eyes, adapting to eliminate its own weaknesses.\n\nThe effects are solid enough although I have to say the first form does look a little daft and reminded me of one of those memes where someone had stuck Cookie Monster googly eyes on a xenomorph from alien. The scene where Gojira develops his atomic breath is pretty frightening though.\n\nAt its heart this is a political tale and it&apos;s not really subtle about that with all the character focus being on government officials and nothing really given to the 3.5million evacuated refugees apart from being mentioned. The repeated use of the term &quot;collateral damage&quot; serves as a stark reminder of average Joe&apos;s place in the order of things.\n\nThere&apos;s a widely discussed ending shot which is open to interpretation and has spawned a number of theories. Which I like.\n\nOverall this is a decent film and I enjoyed it.",

Maybe I would even buy the BluRay.\n\nIt is full of twists, surprises, I can understand the emotions of the characters and I really like how the characters developed. Yes, there are plot holes (like with every movie that involves time travel), yes, not each performance is Oscar worthy, but if you don&apos;t expect &quot;The Godfather&quot; in the Star Wars universe, you might like it.\n\nI rated it 7 out of 10, because I really like SF flicks, for &quot;normal&quot; people it might be a 6.\n\nEnjoy",

      "reviewBody": "This one stays watchable thanks to a bright, buoyant-as-always Reese Witherspoon, but the writing and direction are on auto-pilot. For a film that pretentiously begins in 2003 and ends in 2023, there&apos;s very little actual romance or comedy here that grabs your sustained attention. The film just plods along in a familiar &quot;can best friends turn lovers?&quot; setup, the payoff of which is so minuscule and very 2003-like. Sure, it&apos;s not a film you&apos;d ditch half-way, yet it has nothing that warrants a revisit - as is the case with most Netflix &quot;originals.&quot; Also, a film like this would have actually benefited from having Kutcher and Witherspoon in the same space (to hell with those split-screens) a lot longer than 5 minutes tops. Hands up if you think Witherspoon deserves a better-written, better-directed comeback film! 🙌",

      "reviewBody": "With the BWP hype, a lot of talk of going around about &quot;the scariest movie you&apos;ve ever seen&quot;. Probably because I&apos;ve seen over a thousand horror/fright/suspense/gore movies, I have trouble pinning it down. I can&apos;t name the scariest, I can name the top 5. As far as non-supernatural horror goes, this movie and Last House on the Left are the scariest movies I&apos;ve ever seen.\n\nI saw this at a film festival and the audience was very, very quiet. My friend and I just sat there quietly cowering most of the time. It&apos;s just way too realistic. The opening and closing are probably the most frightening, and we don&apos;t even see Henry killing anyone, just the bodies of his victims and their terrified screams in the background, echoing. It will give you chills down your spine. The stuff in the movie that scared me wasn&apos;t any big &quot;jumps&quot; or gore, just very disturbing, creepy moments (especially if you knew someone who was been the victim of a homicide, as I do). My friend I saw it with worked at the city prosecutors office and heard about plenty of local murder cases and said it rang very, very true to life. One of the most chilling scenes is early on, when Henry goes to a mall and just sits patiently in the parking lot, scanning. The camera looks coldly and calculatedly at different women in the parking lot from Henry&apos;s point of view. There are so many shots you almost start to wonder what the point of the scene is until it hits you: they are ALL potential victims, this is how he looks at women. I have always been careful as a woman whenever I am alone but after seeing the film, to this DAY I do not walk to my car alone at the mall without my mace in my hand, and I look all around me and never turn my back on anyone. The movie also does not glamorize the killing or violence against women at all.\n\nAlso, it&apos;s a good primer on home and personal safety. (a good rule- Do not EVER let a stranger into your house when you are home alone if you were not expecting him. In fact, after I saw this I never open the door when I am home alone and not expecting anyone, period. Think I&apos;m paranoid? Watch this movie and see how safe you feel).\n\nThe plot sounds simple but it&apos;s not boring. The movie follows the exploits of Henry, a young man who is practically a textbook case of a serial killer (male, white, 30&apos;s, drifter, soft-spoken, shy). Conflict comes when his disgusting nasty inbred cousin Otis Toole stays with him, along with his pathetic sister. One night Otis and Henry pick up a couple of prostitutes and are having sex with them in the car. Henry kills both of them sort of offhandedly, with no more emotion than you would swat a fly. Otis starts joining him on his exploits. Henry is more sympathetic than Otis, however, because while Henry does these things because he is sick and doesn&apos;t have a choice, Otis seems to get off on them, and also should know better. Things sorta go downhill from there, and the sister complicates things because she is so desperately lonely that Henry starts to look good to her. It culminates in one of the most chilling, downbeat endings of all time.\n\nAfter I saw this movie at the festival, I was lucky enough to be there when Michael Rooker, who plays the title character, came out and lectured and did Q &amp; A. When I say lucky, I don&apos;t mean lucky that I got to meet a celebrity (though that was neat). I mean lucky that I was able to have proof immediately afterwards that this was just a movie. If the movie had ended and I just had to get up and go home, I probably wouldn&apos;t have gotten any sleep for about a week. He was very nice and personable, wore glasses and a blazer, not at all like his character. The thing I remember most clearly is someone asked him what kind of movies he liked and he replied, &quot;I don&apos;t like horror movies, really, I like musicals&quot;. Everyone laughed for about 5 minutes, partially out of relief. BIG relief. See, it&apos;s just a movie, there&apos;s the actor right there, and ha-ha, he&apos;s actually very shy and charming and harmless, isn&apos;t that funny?\n\nEven with all of that, I still find this one of the most disturbing, unsettling movies ever made. You haven&apos;t seen a really scary movie until you see this movie."

      "reviewBody": "The Howling\n\nEasily one of the most historically popular werewolf films out there deserves some attention, right? Well of course. And since lately I&apos;m getting more and more into werewolf films, I figured it was high time I actually bought this one and reviewed it. This, along with American Werewolf in London, were the two films that revolutionized werewolf movies and transformed them from just some guy running around bein&apos; all hairy and strangling people. On top of it all, we have Joe Dante (Piranha, Gremlins) directing. Good times will be had by all!\n\nThis film revolves around a news anchor-woman who is helping the police track down a serial killer, made all the easier by the fact that he&apos;s taken an interest in her. Well, everything goes just awful and she ends up traumatized. Her shrink suggests she and her husband take a comfortable, soothing vacation in a community that he&apos;s a major part of. Of course, the movie is helped along by the fact that the town just happens to be chock full of werewolves who can&apos;t seem to decide whether to eat these new people or have them join up.\n\nHere&apos;s the breakdown:\n\nThe Good:\n\n--We&apos;ve got some beautiful and unique looking werewolves here. The first one we have a very clear view of, in the doctor&apos;s office, almost resembles some creature that&apos;s part wolf, part man, and part cat. It just kind of had that feel--not that it&apos;s bad, I liked it.\n\n--Interesting story, one of the better ones in the world of werewolves.\n\n--The acting is pretty good, one has to consider the fact that a lot of actors just don&apos;t take these kinds of roles seriously enough. So finding a movie like this where they do is quite nice.\n\n--Naked transforming werewolf sex scene by a campfire. Hmmm... maybe this should be the Memorable Scene....\n\n--Average amounts of violence--more a suspenseful werewolf film than a visually disturbing one. The gore, while only occasional, is really good.\n\n--Nice mystery story wrapped up in here.\n\nDidn&apos;t Hurt It, Didn&apos;t Help:\n\n--Decent music, somewhat average for these kind of movies.\n\n--Dee Wallace-Stone&apos;s acting occasionally isn&apos;t quite up to par, shall we say...\n\n--One werewolf transformation sequence is actually animated--like with cell animation and it doesn&apos;t look very good. It&apos;s brief and small, and doesn&apos;t detract from the film&apos;s overall quality.\n\n--Dee Wallace&apos;s friends in the movie really seem to adopt the notion of werewolves rather easily--I would think it would be hard to accept that idea... oh well...\n\nThe Bad:\n\n--Some two-dimensional characters.\n\n--This film is in a series notorious for it&apos;s much crappier releases, but that&apos;s really about all there is that&apos;s not to like.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n--Robert Picardo (the hologram doctor from Star Trek: Voyager) plays the ultimate bad-ass werewolf--and boy, his face doesn&apos;t look good all charred with acid...\n\nMemorable Scene:\n\n--Robert Picardo&apos;s werewolf in the Doctor&apos;s office. Oh, and that werewolf transformation sex scene. That was pretty hot.\n\nActing: 8/10 Story: 9/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Character Development: 8/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 8/10 (some less than fancy stop-motion, and one bit of obvious animation) Nudity/Sexuality: 4/10 Violence/Gore: 8/10 (Average amount, but very high quality) Sets/Backgrounds: 9/10 Dialogue: 7/10 Music: 7/10 Writing: 8/10 Direction: 9/10 \n\nCheesiness: 1/10 Crappiness: 0/10\n\nOverall: 8/10 \n\nA horror must-see. One of the classic werewolf films. Personally, I think Dog Soldiers may still be a little better, but that&apos;s just me. For horror fans and a great piece for non-horror fans to find out what a good werewolf movie should look like--sans CG werewolves.\n\nwww.ResidentHazard.com http://bartboard.proboards3.com/index.cgi The Board, movie message board.",

I didn&apos;t hate this movie. You typical story with an antagonist and a protagonist. You shift from hating the antagonist to loving the antagonist... blah blah blah.... if you go into this movie with an open mind, you can enjoy what it provides. Anna Farris does a great job of portraying her typical personality. I&apos;ve always been a fan of Eugenio Derbez, and think he did equally well carrying his role. Eva Longoria played a small role, but did very well as a supporting actress. If I was asked to watch or pass, I&apos;d say watch.",

To be fair I don&apos;t think many who go in blind are going to be expecting what they get. A bizarre experience to say the least.\n\nThe film is set in a beautiful location. It&apos;s a pleasure to look at. You&apos;re going to see the horror tag attached to this movie, and it is in a odd sort of way I suppose, but mostly this is a drama with a twist. If you go in expecting a horror you&apos;re likely going to come away disappointed.\n\nWhether this story will connect with you or not is anyone&apos;s guess. There are people who are going to hate every second of it, and there are people who will love it. I fell somewhere in the middle personally. It&apos;s unapologetically different though and I respect that a lot. 6/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Based on the 1974 American movie, The Longest Yard, Mean Machine is about an ex-pro footballer/soccer player who is sent to prison. Hated at first, he gains friends when he begins to coach an all-convict soccer team against the prison guards&apos; already-established team.\n\nI haven&apos;t seen the original so I can&apos;t compare them but I found Mean Machine pretty enjoyable. Vinnie Jones does a good job as Danny Meehan and it&apos;s nice to see him in a role where he&apos;s not the scary one. I liked the subtle humour as well, from Massive&apos;s ironic name to the unpredictable Monk (the crazy &quot;Scot even the Scots are afraid of&quot; - convincingly played by Jason Statham) to the pair of commentators, Bob and Bob at the final match.\n\nThe DVD I saw included audio tracks for both the original UK theatrical release and the &quot;domestic&quot; (i.e. American) release. After watching the original, I learned that the American had a few words re-dubbed to make the language easier to understand for these audiences. I then watched the second version and didn&apos;t find much of a difference between the two. There were some things that the character Nitro said that were noticeably re-dubbed (which didn&apos;t help much considering the way he shouts!) and a few slang terms were changed to more international expressions. I think some reviewers of this film may have been unaware of this and so complained about the more obvious dubbing.\n\nThe only one I actually found helpful was when a character says he&apos;s in prison &quot;for [an abbreviation].&quot; I didn&apos;t catch what he said and the American version replaced the letters with &quot;assault and battery.&quot; I found one change a bit puzzling though: Mr. Sykes gives the governor of the prison tips for horse racing, writing letters next to his choices on a newspaper. After losing money on a false winner (&quot;W&quot;), Sykes explains to the governor that &quot;it got smudged in the rain. It says EW: either way.&quot; This was changed to &quot;EW: to place.&quot; I thought the original was quite clear and the new one no longer matches the letters.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s not a bad film. I liked it enough to watch it twice and if you like football/soccer and prison films, there aren&apos;t many that combine the two to choose from."

      "reviewBody": "Jack Frost (1998) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nMusician Jack Frost (Michael Keaton) has neglected his kid Charlie (Joseph Cross) for years and one day before Christmas he&apos;s killed in a car wreck. Flash forward a year when Charlie builds a snowman who is magically taken over by the spirit of his father and two begin to spend some quality time together. You can read just about any review out there for this film and words such as disgusting, creepy, ugly, rude and traumatizing are going to be used. I must admit that there are times when I watch movies and I just can&apos;t see what people see in them and there are times when I view a movie where I can&apos;t see why people hate them so much. Look, I agree that this kids film has a rather ugly subject in regards to a kid losing his father but for the life of me I can&apos;t figure out why there&apos;s so much hatred thrown at this film. I thought the film was very sweet, featured some good performances and I think its heart is in the right place. I really don&apos;t understand why some are taking such a strong moral clause with this film and throwing a judgment on it as to what damage it might do to kids. Really? Countless Disney films have scared young children yet no one says a word about them. E.T. scared me to death as a child but no one bashes that film. Is JACK FROST in their level? Not even close but no matter the quality I don&apos;t see the need for the moral police. Again, I thought the film was innocent enough and had a good heart. I thought Keaton did a very good job early in the film when we actually see him and I thought his vocal work as the snowman was terrific. I found him to be fun to watch and I thought the relationship between him and the son was quite good. Is JACK FROST the next IT&apos;S A WONDERFUL LIFE? Of course not but I don&apos;t see the need for calling this movie child abuse."

Apparently &quot;Splinter&quot; is an independent film, but it doesn&apos;t deserve to be lumped in the same category as the hundreds of &quot;low budget&quot; horror movies out there that are hardly more than a few friends with a camcorder and some ketchup packets. The production value here looks as good as many Hollywood movies, and the &quot;monster&quot; is done particularly well. The three main actors are great, and the characters are likable.\n\nThis movie isn&apos;t going to change the genre or make anyone&apos;s Top 10 list, but it&apos;s definitely one of the more entertaining horror films I&apos;ve seen in the last couple of years. It&apos;s a fun way to spend 80 minutes. My 8 out of 10 rating is a bit over-inflated simply because there have been so many terrible horror movies put out recently that it was refreshing to genuinely enjoy one from start to finish. A more realistic rating would be 6 or 6.5. Totally worth the price of admission, and I look forward to seeing more from this director in the future.",

      "reviewBody": "RACE is a &quot;by-the-numbers&quot; bio-pic of Jesse Owens and his 4 Gold Medals won at the 1936 Olympics in the heart of Nazi Germany. A perfectly agreeable - and instantly forgettable - movie that skims the surface, but never really delves into, the events that transpired.\n\nDirector Stephen Hopkins has mainly worked in television and it shows as this film was nice, hitting on some controversial topics of race and politics, but never really hitting them too hard. As soon as the movie hits on a topic, it moves on to some sort of &quot;feel good&quot; moment, mostly of Owens winning a race.\n\nWhile the stakes in the world were high at the time, the stakes in this movie never really seemed high. Partly, I blame the director, but there should also be fault found in the two lead performances of Stephan James (as Jesse) and Jason Sudekis as his coach, Larry Snyder. They both do some good &quot;TV&quot; acting, in that they hit a note of contemplation, or angst or sadness right before they jump to another scene and the previous scenes emotions were completely forgotten.\n\nA case in point was the championships where Owens hurts his back right before competing. There&apos;s a confrontation scene between Owens and Snyder where the coach declares &quot;I&apos;m going to scratch you&quot; from this very big race. Owens glares and says &quot;no way&quot; and then competes and sets all types of records and the injury was never spoken of, or referred to, or even was a factor in the race.\n\nAll in all a &quot;fine&quot; motion picture, one that I will forget that I saw when I look back at the films that I viewed in 2016.\n\n6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis",

      "reviewBody": "Obviously, the original &quot;Fantasia&quot; was the state of the art when it was released in 1940. In fact, it remained there for many years. From an animation standpoint, I think Disney finally topped it when they released &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; in 1959. Still, as an accomplishment, I believe that &quot;Fantasia&quot; was Walt Disney&apos;s finest achievement.\n\nHe certainly wanted the idea of &quot;Fantasia&quot; to continue, but as time went on, it seemed that it would never happen. Our tastes in animation became more and more sophisticated along with the greater advancements we have seen in animation in the last decade. When Disney released the original &quot;Fantasia&quot; on video in 1991, many who had seen it criticized the film as being too arty, with long segments that would not appeal to children.\n\nPerhaps many people thought that the word &quot;Disney&quot; always should be associated with kids. That is unfair, for Walt would have wanted all ages of people to enjoy his films. \n\nWhen Roy Disney announced a few years ago that Disney was making a new &quot;Fantasia&quot;, I was surprised and excited. In the time that movies like &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Toy Story&quot;, and &quot;A Bug&apos;s Life&quot; were taking in huge sums of cash, it seemed that Disney was willing to take the risk again and make the film anyway.\n\nWhat a treat it is! Most of the segments of the film stayed in my memory for days, as did the music. There is true genius in &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; in the connections of imagery to music. For example, the combination of Gershwin&apos;s &quot;Rhapsody In Blue&quot; the Al Hirschfeld-style caricatures was so perfect that the music seemed written for that type of visual presentation.\n\n&quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; left me breathless and practically speechless. I even enjoyed the celebrity introductions throughout the picture.\n\n Using my preferred four-star rating system, I would give &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; this:\n\n       ****-\n\nThe minus is there for the only criticism I have of it: Too short! The original &quot;Fantasia&quot; was a two-hour event, while &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; was only 74 minutes. That is the same length as most other Disney animated features. Was 74 minutes determined by: a. Expense of the budget, or b. The expected length of children&apos;s attention spans?\n\nFrom the depth of my heart, I recommend &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;. It left me wanting more. George"

      "reviewBody": "What differentiates &quot;The Cave&quot; from other horror films is the setting. The plot takes place mostly in a large cave, some of which is underwater.\n\nBy far, the best element of this film is the underground scenery. The sets are realistic, with spaces and formations that one might see in certain large caverns. And, the film nicely conveys a sense of vertical scale, as we watch cavers climb rock walls, and explore huge rooms with towering ceilings.\n\nThe problem here is that the film&apos;s director is so committed to an action plot that the camera rarely stays in one scene long enough for the viewer to have a sense of place. We thus forgo the thrill that an underground environment could provide. There&apos;s no feeling of amazement, no claustrophobia from tight crawlways, no real fear of any kind. The film&apos;s fast pace, combined with characters we barely know and care nothing about, thus dilutes the intended suspense.\n\nThe cinematography is flashy and very technical. The lighting is appropriately subdued with interesting colors and unusual camera angles. The background music is somewhat intrusive. Dialogue is weak. And the actors, who appear to be in their twenties, are all photogenic, straight out of central casting. The monsters, what we see of them, seem slightly hokey.\n\nOverall, &quot;The Cave&quot; will appeal to viewers who like horror films set in unusual environments, wherein the pace is super fast, and there is a ton of action. Viewers looking for a credible story will need to exit the cave ... quickly."

      "reviewBody": "After over one-hundred years of cinema, it&apos;s pretty rare to come across a film unlike anything you&apos;ve seen before, let alone one that begs the question: how the hell did they pull that off? Even though blockbuster films like Gravity try to do this by taking us to great heights (no pun intended) through technological / cinematographic advancements, we somehow end up bored with the result. Who really cares how long and complicated your opening take is if it feels like it lives inside the brain of a computer? Perhaps fiction has been done to death, perhaps we&apos;ve advanced the tech behind fictional filmmaking so far that it&apos;s completely lost touch with reality. This is probably why, today, documentaries have never been more relevant and more capable of blowing your mind. The advantage documentaries have over fiction is that they can show us things so unbelievable they could only exist in the real world. Truth is truly stranger than fiction.\n\nJoshua Oppenheimer&apos;s The Act of Killing is a very special documentary. What begins as a glimpse into the lives of a handful of former death squad leaders, Oppenheimer then invites them to help produce fictional recreations of their killings, recreations mimicking the style of the murderers&apos; favourite Hollywood movies. As the fiction overtakes the lives of its subjects, The Act of Killing becomes what Oppenheimer has described as &quot;a documentary of the imagination.&quot; Never before has such nightmarish and surreal terrain been excavated, revealing a chilling indifference to nothing less than unpunished crimes against humanity.\n\nIf you&apos;ve ever tried to imagine what a Nazi conquered world would be like, this documentary might be closest thing we&apos;ll ever have to actually knowing. What we discover is that when history is written by the victors, we see something very frightening emerge: acceptance of brutality as not only necessary, but heroic. Aware of how it&apos;s so much easier to see the contents of a fishbowl when staring at it from a distance, The Act of Killing positions its viewers in a way that forces us to question our own perspective on how and why things really are in the world, not in the way we&apos;ve been brainwashed to believe. The murderous thugs Oppenheimer immortalizes are not behind bars, or on trial for war crimes, or any of their crimes; these men are heroes in their native Indonesia, on parade to be adored by their hero-worshipping countrymen and women.\n\nConsidering Oppenheimer cast his subjects inside a surreal, hyper-stylized world of fictional recreations, it&apos;s impossible to argue The Act of Killing isn&apos;t manipulative. But it&apos;s the lengths Oppenheimer goes to -- the soaring heights of absurdity these staged recreations go to -- that confirm, whatever moral compass exists, it is not being directed by someone with a hidden agenda. Ultimately, the fictitious pageantry calls attention to how difficult it is for someone to have perspective when they&apos;re lost within a concrete belief system cemented by victory, history, and the applause of an entire nation. If you think you wouldn&apos;t have been swept away by the mass-hysteria/nationalism excited by the Nazis pre-WW2, then you&apos;re lying to yourself as much as you may have been for having bought into Obama&apos;s movement for &apos;Change.&apos; I know I&apos;m guilty of the latter.\n\nDamning as it is, Oppenheimer&apos;s surreal world also acts as an arena for &apos;art&apos; therapy, treatment both logical and plausible for men who&apos;ve been playing roles their whole lives. Decades ago these gangsters were young, ego-driven, power hungry men who performed the most horrible acts imaginable...and now as old men, they&apos;ve perfected their roles as heroic cowboys proud of having defended the homestead. But once the act is over and the veil lifted, these men are revealed to be victims of their own acts, sickened by what they&apos;ve done, who they are, and the &apos;act&apos; they&apos;ve clung to in order to preserve their own sanity. To gain access to the minds of characters so repulsive and sinister is something even the best screenwriters couldn&apos;t fathom pulling off; to be able to humanize them, and make them sympathetic is a feat of filmmaking unlike anything I&apos;ve ever watched before.\n\nSomething else I&apos;ve never seen before is a film with one &quot;anonymous&quot; credit, let alone dozens of them, including one given to a co-director. The gravity of this reminds us the killings proudly re-enacted by the film&apos;s subjects are not just nostalgic, but very much a part of the today&apos;s way of doing business. By the time the credits scroll we realize the real culprit here, the one we cannot pardon, is Capitalism.\n\nThe Act of Killing depicts capitalism at its darkest hour, in a special place where brutality and savagery are necessary and applauded. Immersing us in such a dark place, The Act of Killing shows us how difficult it is to identify the outlines of our own faces once the definitions of &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; are mutated beyond recognition. History asks us: How far removed are we from these crimes? Was it not our governments who supported these atrocities? Whether we knew it or not, we collectively turned blind eyes, condoning a genocide that took the lives of over one million people. These are the realizations we should be most sickened and disturbed by, but are we? We enabled these men to kill so who are we to judge, and if the results coincide with our politics, do we even care?\n\nwww.eattheblinds.com",

      "reviewBody": "I really didn&apos;t care much for &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks,&quot; and so to be honest I never even bothered with &quot;The Squeakquel.&quot; I did, however, choose to inflict &quot;Chipwrecked&quot; upon myself (in the company of my daughter, who&apos;s 8.) I can say without any doubt at all that she&apos;s too advanced for it. There were a couple of scenes that elicited a chuckle from her - and I think one got a chuckle out of me, but that was it. There were other scenes that caused her to engage in her favourite hobby of drawing, while I mercifully caught up on some sleep two or three times. This is not a good movie.\n\nThe story is empty throughout and silly most of the time. Yeah, I know, it&apos;s about singing chipmunks, so of course it&apos;s silly. But still. And the evil Ian is still a part of this. I really found him irritating in the first movie. Why is he still there? The title of the movie more or less explains it - the chipmunks are on a cruise heading to the International Music Awards when they&apos;re accidentally cast away on a deserted island. (And, yes, there is great homage paid to the movie &quot;Cast Away&quot; in this.) But there&apos;s really just nothing to maintain interest in this.\n\nIf you&apos;re over the age of 5, you probably won&apos;t get anything out of this. The 5 and under set might appreciate the undeniable &quot;cute-ness&quot; of the chipmunks. But having seen this, I do hope it&apos;s the end of the series. (2/10)",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Coco before Chanel&quot; is exactly that; the life of an impoverished girl up until the start of what became a fashion empire.\n\nThis I must say is a different kind of a biopic. There was some sort of subtleness about it, everything was going too slow and not much was happening in terms of demonstrating that this hopeless little girl from nowhere had this extraordinary talent for cloth-making. Yes we did see her advocating simplicity in times of great extravagance and even dressing up (probably) her first clients but had the viewer not been aware of the brand &quot;Chanel&quot; he or she would have to wait until the finishing titles to realise Coco turned out to become a fashion icon.\n\nIf there is one thing about Coco is that she was a rebel; in a late 19th century puritan society she stood up for what she believed, refused to get married and instead of settling for a wedlock with a rich spouse she chose to live the adventure, go to Paris and start up a hat shop.\n\nIt seems however that her rebellious nature extended to her design skills. To use her own words: &quot;Simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance.&quot; Coco Chanel always kept the clothing she designed simple, comfortable and revealing. Unlike most designers in that Europe, she kept the woman inside the clothes at the center of her creations. &quot;I gave women a sense of freedom; I gave them back their bodies: bodies that were drenched in sweat, due to fashion&apos;s finery, lace, corsets, underclothes, padding.&quot; Perhaps it was fate or desperation from her impoverished upbringing but the affair with the playboy millionaire and, later, his best friend were pivotal to give her the push she needed to make a start. Though not an expert on French upper class culture but were quite impressed how civilized and elegant the two men were when it came to loving and pursuing the same woman.\n\nAll in all a decent film but no wow factor.",

      "name": "It&apos;s a fairytale, what more can I say?",
      "reviewBody": "As transparent as it is absurd, &quot;The Prince and Me&quot; is nothing more than a regurgitation of the classic royalty-or-famous-person-meets--unsuspecting-commoner-and-they-fall-in-love- and-live-happily-ever-after fairytale that has been passed down from generation to generation. But thanks to the charms of the established young actress, Julia Stiles, and the new up and coming Brit, Luke Mably, mixed with the somehow amusing screenplay by the writers of the soon to come Kate Hudson picture &quot;Raising Helen&quot;, &quot;The Prince and Me,&quot; succeeds in its genre.\n\nSet in Wisconsin, Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles) is a driven pre-med student who is determined not to be weighed down by a careless romance, and Prince Edward (Luke Mably) of Denmark is the restless king to be who is avoiding royal responsibility to be a rebellious college kid in the States. Despite his odd, self absorbed manner, and trailing assistant, nobody seems to guess his true identity, and Paige believes he is a foreign exchange student. The magnetism between Stiles and Mably cannot be denied, and when their two opposite characters attract, there are definitely fireworks. The cat and mouse chase exposition is much more interesting than the over the top finale, but it helps develop the story so you are still paying attention at the end.\n\nAnd of course, Paige teaches Eddie about love and work ethic, while Eddie teaches Paige about poetry and the pains and pleasures of wealth and privilege. This dull, predictable, and recycled premise has been used many a time because with the right stars and right lighting, it easily reminds the audience of the innocence, joy, and surprises that are found in love.  And that is truly the greatest story ever told, so why not tell it over and over and over and over again? Thus, an enjoyable cinema experience is practically guaranteed if you put the idea in capable hands.\n\nModest humor and sincere characters bring the story to life. The glimpse into Denmark royalty is intriguing and believable, and the film&apos;s characters are impossible to dislike. Stiles and Mably give equally thorough performances and I wouldn&apos;t mind seeing them pair up again for a more thought-provoking project.\n\nSince the dialogue was satisfying, it is surprising the script at large wasn&apos;t a bit more realistic or original. But I assume that wasn&apos;t the aim, and am in a forgiving mood today.\n\nIn fact, I am glad that &quot;The Prince and Me&quot; didn&apos;t attempt to venture into more dramatic territory, for that would be unnecessary, and merely pretentious. Director Martha Coolige knows what &quot;The Prince and Me&quot; is and she doesn&apos;t try to make it anything more, so it stays on track with an obvious and clear goal in mind.\n\n&quot;The Prince and Me&quot; won&apos;t change or challenge you, but it just may uplift you for the movie&apos;s duration plus two or three, maybe even five, minutes afterward, so why not pay the five to eight bucks? But if you seek more than temporary well wrapped candy, hunker in on the two leads or just avoid the picture completely."

Whenever I stumble upon it, I end up watching it. Too many scenes start the old water works for me.\n\nPeggy seeing her little sister for the first time, going into her old bedroom, and hearing her grandmother&apos;s voice on the phone are all quite touching.\n\nCall me crazy but I just love the moment where Charlie takes Peggy down into the basement and confronts her about what is going on. When he leaves, Peggy opens a music box, pulls out a cigarette and lights it.\n\nAnother special moment happens when Peggy smokes a joint and talks about what she&apos;d like to be when she grows up, as she turns around and around under a starry sky.\n\nThis is quite a good movie, filled with many special performances and scenes along the way.",

Instead, this is an attempt to get inside Van Gogh&apos;s head, and a brilliant one at that. Imagine being the world&apos;s greatest artist, with zero validation and constant ridicule by the establishment around you. That&apos;s the torturous state of being this film encapsulates and does it with purpose. At times, the cinema language gets more experimental than necessarily to accomplish its goal, but I commend the director for pushing the boundaries of standard filmmaking and letting us inhabit Van Gogh&apos;s mind for this brief period. I genuinely felt a loss for this escape from my own mind when Van Gogh passed. I recommend anyone involved with artistic or creative thinking to watch this film.",

Wouldn&apos;t life be simpler is these two could murder the women that make them miserable?\n\nThe first two-thirds of the movie are funny, especially the scenes involving Larry&apos;s writing class. But somewhere along the way it becomes a frantic nightmare, with Larry fighting for his sanity while a &quot;kooky&quot; musical score blares incessantly on the soundtrack. And the inconsistencies of Owen&apos;s character are more than a little distracting.\n\nIn the end, though, &quot;Throw Momma From The Train&quot; is an entertaining, original movie with some very funny scenes. It is worth checking out if you can rent it or see it on cable.\n\nGRADE: B-"

Sure, Stone throws in a few &quot;camp moments&quot;, but who cares, as she is Catherine Davis Tramell, weaving a story of intrigue and doom for whoever falls into her hands.\n\nLondon is a perfect location for the grown up Catherine, and the city reflects the new sophisticated evilness which she is weaving into another book of her deadly sins. The British cast, Charlotte Rampling and the handsome David Morrisey especially, provide the perfect moments in the film to send Stone/Tramell into her evil ways. The sets are so dark, reminded me of ASYLUM, and Stone perfectly matches the glamor of London.\n\nBASIC INSTINCT 2 will never be the first BASIC INSTINCT, and it shouldn&apos;t, as Catherine Tramell has moved on from Nick and pretty little San Francisco to something bigger-London, and with the ending, also reminded me of ASYLUM, you wonder if our Catherine is onto new and more deadly games.

      "reviewBody": "How bad was your college roommate? After Sara (Kelly) meets her new college roommate Rebecca (Meester) she thinks she has found a new friend. When Sara starts to do things without Rebecca strange things begin to happen. Let me first start by saying that this is not a bad movie, but it is definitely geared toward a specific age group, and it&apos;s not mine. For the 19-20 year olds this will be very creepy. For the older crowd this is a definite remake of &quot;Single White Female&quot;, but in my opinion not as good. For those who have not seen that movie this will be very creepy. For those that have seen that movie you will notice the very similar scenes and ideas. Again this is actually not a bad movie, but if I was 10 years younger and a girl this would really scare me. If you are older like me and want to be creeped out by a movie like this one, I&apos;d stick with the original &quot;Single White Female&quot;. I will say the Leighton Meester, in a departure from her usual roles, did a really great job of playing a creepy stalker. I just could not really get in to this movie. I give it a B-.\n\nWould I watch again? - I don&apos;t think I would, but it made me want to watch &quot;Single White Female&quot; again.\n\n*Also Try - Kalamity &amp; Single White Female",

    "summary": "Reviewers say 'Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1' is ambitious with stunning cinematography and epic scope. Praised for historical accuracy and Kevin Costner's performance, it faces criticism for disjointed storytelling, slow pacing, and lack of cohesive narrative. Some suggest it fits better as a TV series due to its length and multiple storylines. The abrupt ending lacks resolution, though many remain hopeful for future chapters, anticipating a more connected and engaging story.",

      "reviewBody": "Horizon is watchable and even enjoyable in parts. The cinematography was well executed, a visual feast in places, and there were some interesting story arcs. However, I&apos;ve never seen a movie so messed up by atrociously bad editing. Several times while watching I found myself wondering what the hell was going on. Had I missed a scene? How did we get here? Then it really goes haywire towards the end without even referencing what it is doing. As if someone has fast forwarded the movie.\n\nThe we come to the story and script... if you were expecting a viscerally raw portrayal of the realities of the old west similiar to Cormac McCarthy&apos;s &apos;Blood Meridien&apos;, you&apos;ll be sorely disappointed. Horizon is more akin to &apos;Little House on the Prairie&apos;. Some of the dialogue and interactions are embarrassingly mawkish. Your sense of credibility is stretched to breaking point.\n\nAfter you&apos;ve finished watching Horizon, and someone who hasn&apos;t seen it asks you what it was about, you&apos;re likely to scratch your head and say, &apos;Er..........&apos;.\n\nI get the feeling Costner has bitten off more than he can chew with this production. He seems to have aimed for &apos;the western to end all westerns&apos;. In my opinion, he&apos;s fallen far short of that. I hope the remaining &apos;chapters&apos; save the day but I wouldn&apos;t bet on it.",

At first, you are guided through very slow-paced storytelling about Craig and his relationship with Mr. Harrigan. This part of the plot is character development.

This movie is about character development and knowing how to deal with death and hard times.\n\nI find this movie to be a worthy adaptation of the short story.

      "reviewBody": "Iris (Kelsey Asbille) is a young woman mourning the death of her young son from an accidental fall on a family camping trip. Waking up early and without telling her husband, Iris makes her way to her son&apos;s memorial in the park intent on jumping off the same cliff only to be stopped by an engagement with a seemingly well-intentioned stranger named Richard (Finn Wittrock) who tells her his own experience of loss with his girlfriend Chloe causing the two of them to walk back to their cars together. However once there Richard reveals himself to be a serial killer and kidnaps Iris knocking her unconscious. Thanks to a Swiss Army knife Iris manages to make Richard crash the car and escape only to be informed by Richard he&apos;s injected her with a paralytic agent that will work its way through her system over the next 20 minutes rendering her completely immobile.\n\nDon&apos;t Move is the new Netflix thriller produced by Sam Raimi and directed by Adam Schindler and Brian Netto who are no strangers to working with Raimi having directed Grey Cloud Island (Minnesota) for Raimi&apos;s Quibi anthology series 50 States of Fright as well as collaborating on their own solo projects like Netto&apos;s Delivery: The Beast Within or Schindler&apos;s Intruders. The film was announced in 2022 with a script by Schindler&apos;s Intruders scribes T. J. Cimfel and David White with shooting commencing in 2023 with Netflix acquiring distribution rights the following year. Don&apos;t Move doesn&apos;t reinvent the wheel when it comes to this kind of &quot;cat and mouse&quot; thriller, but it utilizes the format effectively to generate palpable tension thanks to brisk efficient direction and an engaging heroine and villain.\n\nIf I were to compare Don&apos;t Move to something, I&apos;d probably say the best comparison is a serial killer version of the movie Red Eye from 2005. Much like how that film was built around the tension and chemistry generated between Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy, a similar effect is achieved between Asbille and Wittrock. Kelsey Asbille does well playing a grieving mother who feels trapped by the world following the death of her son and it&apos;s incorporated well into her struggle for survival that gives her an arc for being able to live again. On the opposite side we have Finn Wittrock (who I mainly know from season 4 of American Horror Story before I stopped watching) who is very good as the man calling himself &quot;Richard&quot; whose good looks and charismatic charm are nicely contrasted with the darker nature that reveals itself and creates a terrifying character who can bend and twist reality on the fly to meet his ends. In terms of mining a feature length ride from the central premise of character being paralyzed I&apos;ll admit I was more than a little skeptical as while it&apos;s a terrifying idea it&apos;s incredibly difficult to stretch to feature length especially when purposefully limited (such as 2007&apos;s Awake which went to some inexplicable areas in its usage of Anesthesia awareness). Despite the challenges inherent in working with such a concept, Cimfel and White&apos;s screenplay does well in creating high concept scenario&apos;s that inhabit just enough believability (implausible as it may be) that we get some very memorable sequences in which Iris needs to communicate other than words to get help as it&apos;s out of reach only inches away. I also have to applaud cinematographer Zach Kuperstein who manages to take his largely wooded setting and keeps it looking interesting especially as it relates to POV shots from Iris making you feel her helplessness and desperation.\n\nI liked Don&apos;t Move and felt it was a nicely done thrill ride perfect for either a Halloween viewing with friends or just by yourself. What it lacks in originality it more than makes up for in craft, acting, and follow through.",

You say that they could substitute any animal in for the sheep &amp; get the same cliché situations, but they didn&apos;t use just any animal, they used SHEEP, and there&apos;s something really hilarious about a &apos;menacing&apos; medium shot of a sheep standing in a field looking at the camera. :) I just saw it at a midnight IFF screening &amp; it was fun &amp; cheesy, yet I dunno how campy you could call it, because the special fx were pretty amazing - kudos for weta for the animatronic puppets, morphing sequences &amp; really good gross-out gore. Yes, it made the audience groan at some of the baa-a-a-ad jokes, but most of the time we were all laughing hysterically &amp; clapping &amp; cheering at the sheer ridiculousness of it all! I think the vast majority of the audience left the theatre with smiles on their faces &amp; in a good mood! I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants a good laugh &amp; enjoys sheep jokes.

      "reviewBody": "Definitely in that order. It increases comprehension.  In fact, from reading some of the other reviews here, it may be the only way to enjoy this movie.\n\nA great read; a better-than-I-expected screen adaptation.  I had to see it, because I couldn&apos;t imagine how such a character-driven work would be handled on film.  I will tell you that I was predisposed to think that it would not be handled well, but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nAll in all, this movie manages to do a good job of condensing the book into a non-butt-busting film length, while remaining generally faithful to it. The length and the slowness of the movie are really the only ways to convey the meanderings of the book. It&apos;s part of the way this movie creates the slow Southern atmosphere that is such an integral part of the story. Savannah is a character in the book, and the only unifying force other than the author.  It&apos;s easier to convey that in words than pictures, but Eastwood has done a good job of getting the point across here.\n\nThe casting is mostly great, particularly the supporting characters.  Irma P. Hall&apos;s portrayal of Minerva is somehow soothing and slightly menacing, just as the woman seems in the book.  I didn&apos;t know how the casting of the actual Chablis would affect the film, but she really delivers the goods without seeming like stunt casting.\n\nI was irritated by what I felt were John&apos;s and Chablis&apos; too-active roles in the court case, but I suppose I can understand the reasoning behind it.  I don&apos;t have to like it, but I understand it.  Just as irritating, and entirely disposable, was the romantic subplot. These two elements seemed out of the role of observer that Berendt makes for himself the book. Also, the Mandy character is sapped by taking a big, beautiful, interesting woman and making her a generic cute chick. Alison Eastwood does what she can with this bland creation, but I have a feeling that the movie character never would have been featured the book.\n\nNo, it&apos;s not the book, but no movie ever could be. A slavish adaptation would have been a truly boring film, not to mention way longer than this effort. (Can you say, &quot;Just rent the AudioBook?&quot;) And no, it&apos;s not a twisting, turning thrill-ride, because the book isn&apos;t exactly jam-packed with plot.  It is, however, a decent movie if viewed on its own terms and for its own merits.  And after you&apos;ve read the book.",

The soundtrack and sound effect during the film was nothing short of astounding catching your attention.\n\nWith beautiful use of lighting and a lack of props, to put complete focus on the characters. While also using the lightning during the film to set different moods and feelings. With an incredibly slow start, this movie might seem boring at first but end up finishing intensely.\n\nThe negative reviews surrounding The Tragedy of Macbeth are disappointing. To be fair, without subtitles I wouldn&apos;t understand much either. But saying this cast is &quot;woke&quot; is downright disrespectful to the amazing performance by Washington.\n\nThe Tragedy of Macbeth is a beautiful piece of film. It&apos;s definitely a film worth seeing but a lot of people will be disappointed in the slow start and use of old English.",

The film is very much worth watching though it has its&apos; flaws. A very good film, overall, that gives you good action and some things for you to think about.\n\nMostly this film ought to be lauded for its&apos; graphic depictions and its&apos; attempts at accuracy (which greatly supersede most films). It is a very beautiful demonstration of Australian cinema (and proudly so) that is greatly underrated and underviewed. I advise anyone to watch this film.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw Transamerica as the closing film for the Frameline film festival in San Francisco where it won the &quot;The Frameline Audience Award for Best Feature&quot;. The film was obviously a labor of love. Duncan Tucker wrote, directed and wisely cast Felicity Huffman as Bree (before she had been cast as a &quot;desperate housewife&quot;). Huffman&apos;s husband William Macy was executive producer. \n\nThe plot line is certainly the tried and true formula of the transformational road trip, yet the irony of Bree&apos;s concurrent sexual transformation freshens a story that could easily have been cliché. Kevin Zegers and the rest of the supporting cast are superb, but Huffman&apos;s characterization of Bree is Oscar caliber. \n\nSee Transamerica! It&apos;s not tragic like &quot;Boys Don&apos;t Cry&quot;. It&apos;s not about sexuality, fetish, or camp. It&apos;s a movie about otherness, transformation, family, and ultimately acceptance. Felicity Huffman&apos;s Golden Globe winning and Oscar nominated performance is absolutely astounding. Her acting skill fills Bree with insecurity, pathos, warmth, humor, and growth which ultimately transforms the audience&apos;s involvement from freak show curiosity to empathy and identification.\n\nThankfully the Weinstein brothers recognized just how outstandingly strong this performance is and decided that Transamerica would be one of the first films they would choose to distribute after their great success at Miramax. \n\nI saw this movie again during it&apos;s limited distribution, again in general distribution and now own the DVD. Each time I&apos;ve watched it I find even more to like. Transamerica is an indie classic.",

Well this is different. Halfway through you are just positively convinced that this is how Prime is going to end. But it doesn&apos;t. That&apos;s all I&apos;m going to say; see for yourself.\n\nMeryl Streep was hilarious as the Jewish mother/shrink. I loved her. Besides the un-clichéd ending, she is the highlight of the movie.\n\nOverall I thought this was a really good movie.

Directed by Aditya Sarpotdar (fresh off the delightful Munjya), this Ayushmann Khurrana-Rashmika Mandanna starrer takes the franchise into uncharted territory: a bloody romance drawn from Indian folklore, where a skeptical TV reporter named Alok (Ayushmann) stumbles into a hidden tribal world ruled by the enigmatic Thamma (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) and falls for the fierce, undead Tadaka (Rashmika). What follows is a cocktail of humor, supernatural thrills, and heartfelt moments that mostly lands, even if it occasionally trips over its own fangs.\n\nThe film&apos;s biggest strength is its fresh premise-a journalist chasing sensational stories gets more than he bargained for after a bear attack leads him to Tadaka, a woman with no heartbeat and a killer glare. Screenwriters Niren Bhatt, Suresh Mathew, and Arun Fulara weave in clever nods to the broader MHCU (think Stree and Bhediya callbacks that finally make the universe feel interconnected), while the folklore roots add a layer of cultural intrigue that&apos;s refreshingly novel for Hindi cinema. Ayushmann is in top form, nailing the shift from comic vulnerability to intense heroism with his trademark everyman charm-his physical comedy in vampire mishaps had me chuckling, and that second-half transformation is a standout. Rashmika steals every scene as the soul of the film; her blend of grace, fierceness, and mystique makes Tadaka unforgettable, turning what could be a damsel trope into a powerhouse lead. Nawazuddin brings brooding menace as the exiled tribal head, and Paresh Rawal&apos;s comic parental antics provide reliable laughs.\n\nVisually, Thamma shines in theaters-the misty jungles, slick VFX for supernatural elements, and pulsating background score amp up the immersion, making it a festive crowd-pleaser worth the big screen. The horror-comedy balance tilts more toward romance here, with fewer jump scares than predecessors but plenty of witty vampire gags (though they do wear thin after a while). Songs like &quot;Tum Mere Na Huye&quot; add flair without dragging, and the emotional core-a tale of forbidden love amid Partition-era shadows-gives it replay value beyond the scares.\n\nThat said, it&apos;s not all smooth sailing. The first half drags with a slow build-up and uneven pacing, where jokes land softly and the editing feels bloated (trimming a song or two could&apos;ve helped). Some repetitive bits and an awkwardly timed kiss undercut the tension, and while the MHCU ties are fun, they occasionally feel forced, lacking the bite of Stree&apos;s emotional depth. Minor imperfections aside, Thamma doesn&apos;t reinvent the wheel but delivers a well-packaged entertainer that&apos;s perfect for Diwali chills and thrills.\n\nIf you&apos;re a fan of the universe or just craving a humorous horror-rom-com hybrid, catch it soon-expect the unexpected, and leave room for seconds.",

      "reviewBody": "Spread is an unusual little film. I say &apos;little&apos;, as it&apos;s essentially a low budget character-driven drama that is some how being commercially packaged as a rom-com. A quick glance at the credits reveals that this isn&apos;t your average Kutcher vehicle: it&apos;s directed by Scotland&apos;s David Mackenzie of &quot;Young Adam&quot; and &quot;Hallam Foe&quot; fame. \n\nMake no mistake, the Kutcher we see at the start of the film is very familiar: arrogant, uptight and utterly beautiful. But as the run-time flies past, we somehow warm to his character even though he&apos;s getting more sex than most of us will get in a lifetime. And here&apos;s the good news: Kutcher&apos;s performance is fairly astounding. He manages to reveal the humanity in his deeply flawed character with notable subtlety and a distinct lack of cliché. Kutcher&apos;s (many) sexual relationships portrayed in the film are brutally realistic: the modern and perhaps unromantic realities of casual sex are not dressed-up in any cheap Hollywood moralising. This is also evident in the overall tone of the film: there are many moments that could have descended into schmaltz, but a sharp edge it maintained on just about every line of dialogue. \n\nKutcher fans: beware. This is a real departure for the actor, but thank goodness: it&apos;s a movie with all the superficial gloss of Hollywood and all the invention of an indie flick.",

An actor who does not rely on a pretty handsome face or a tall physical body (5&apos;5&quot;), but completely by his fantastic performance to play all the roles in his movies. He is such a versatile actor that could play almost any character in any movie.\n\nThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018), O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000) and Leaves of Grass (2009). The characters he played, all turned out to be so great, powerful, entertaining, and memorable. It&apos;s unbelievable such an ordinary person could find jobs in the cruel society of the Hollywood. His success only proved that as long as you&apos;re really talented in acting, you still can survive in that crucial environment.\n\nOnly a few Western genre movies that really interested me to watch, not just once, but several times:\n\nBlazing Saddles (1974), Clint Eastwood&apos;s 1992 Unforgiven, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018), The Salvation (2014) and, this 2021 Old Henry."

At first he expresses that he wants Jews dead because, as he states, anti-semitism is a human instinct. But Daniel is a Jew himself. He denies his roots, But as the movie progresses he must come to terms with who he is. And that&apos;s not always easy.\n\nRyan Gosling who plays Daniel is a frightening good actor, who almost manages to persuade the audience of his anti-semitic views. I really can&apos;t praise Ryan Gosling enough! He could be one of the great new actors to come. The interesting aspect of this movie is the mental struggle in Daniels mind whether he&apos;s a Nazi or a Jew. Or both? It&apos;s about finding out who you are. The films poses some very intelligent questions, and provokes at times, and this is the films force. This movie is brilliant! Go see it!",

      "reviewBody": "This movie absolutely moves deeply! While it has not adopted all aspects from the book, it does capture the overall sentiment wonderfully. The movie misses some parts I would have included. Such as in the end the long period Violet was waiting and received only small cryptic signs of life from Finch. And only the last of the five wanderings has been transferred into the movie, missing the other ones in which all the cryptic messages are understood and reveal the hidden sides of Finch&apos;s love for Violet. Some details have not been explained, for example the glasses Violet is wearing sometimes, that are her sister&apos;s. But apart from that it is a movie you enjoy watching, it evokes strong emotions. You feel love for Finch and Violet, you feel compassion and affection, and it makes you cry in the end. It absolutely has succeeded in portraying the exact emotions as meant by the writers. The scenery and the music is beautiful and the acting is captivating. It is a movie that will stay on your mind for quite some time after watching and to me that is a sign of a successful movie. It really goes to your heart. You realize - to quote Violet when she tells what Finch has taught her - that even the ugliest of places can be beautiful, as long as you take the time to look.",

      "reviewBody": "Usually I find movies date really badly. For instance, John Carpenter&apos;s Halloween from 1978 is my favorite horror movie. Although I like it a lot, it&apos;s dated now due to the literally graphic changes in the horror genre. I was thinking the same thing of Body Heat before I stepped into it. I was aware of such blessings it had been given, but kept in mind it was a product of the early 80&apos;s. Surely I thought this must be dated by today&apos;s standard of erotic dramas &amp; thrillers. This was not the case.\n\nThis movie has managed to bypass the aging mechanism that movies succumb to. Twenty years after it&apos;s debut it still packs it&apos;s erotic punch and twisted bag of lies. William Hurt and Kathleen Turner are still the premiere duo of &apos;hot legs and ultra cool sleaze bags&apos;. I won&apos;t say much about the story - this is one you should walk into completely blind to better you viewing experience. If you need more, check out the plot summary or read the back of the movie box.\n\nWhat I will talk about is the sex scenes. Erotic without being crude. In today&apos;s age of endless softcore flicks, hardcore conquering new territory - it&apos;s a refreshing to look back at a movie made in the early 80&apos;s and witness such steaminess and tasteful erotica. Not to misdirect your thoughts. This movie isn&apos;t solely about sex, but it&apos;s a big part in a story of manipulation, money and deceit.\n\nThe story, the direction and the cast are fit for a picture frame with Ted Danson and Mickey Rourke standing out amongst the supporting cast. A highly recommended view.",

The only reason I watched this was that I was looking for a film to watch on a Sunday night rather than just another series.\n\nIt definitely has that low budget feel and almost film student look about it, but for some reason I was dragged along with it. It&apos;s definitely a bit different, dark and a bit clever. You think you know where it&apos;s going - and it does go there, but has a bunch of other directions that you didn&apos;t see coming. Some might argue that it&apos;s a bit random - like someone had a bunch of ideas, but only one film so they mashed them altogether. Either way, for me, it worked.\n\nIt&apos;s not going to appeal to everyone and this is evident by the reviews. Give it a try. It&apos;s certainly different to the usual copycat rubbish.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The most performed playwright of all time, the author of 37 plays, 154 sonnets &amp; several narrative poems...and yet not a single manuscript of any kind has ever been found written in Shakespeare&apos;s own hand.&quot; A movie that explores the theory that Shakespeare didn&apos;t write any of the things that he is said to. The theory is that The Earl of Oxford (Ifans) wrote them all as a stab at the new Queen (Redgrave) of England. I have said this before but I am not a Shakespeare fan at all, I just don&apos;t get him. There are a few movies of his I like but for the most part I am not a fan. Needless to say before watching this I was not that excited at all. Almost instantly the movie grabbed me and I was hooked. For those like me this is not really about Shakespeare at all, but more of a political thriller about trying to start and control a rebellion against Queen Elizabeth I in the 1600&apos;s. Weather this is true or not to me doesn&apos;t matter but the idea of writing plays as a way to begin a rebellion is a very interesting theory and makes for a very interesting movie. Overall, (from a non-Shakespeare fan) I really enjoyed this movie and recommend this. I give it a B+.",

I do however think that they used it well and it didn&apos;t really need any more spending on it. I think where it shows it most is the other actors. Some feel like they may have actually just found them in the town they shot at. It doesn&apos;t detract from the film it just kind of sticks out a little bit.\n\nI think the story is pretty interesting too. It was a little bit different which I appreciated. I think the action was pretty engaging too. I will say at some points the film did sag a little bit and I was like this feels a lot longer than an hour and a half. But for the most part it clipped along.\n\nI do think the comedy let it down a little. Some of the jokes were just awful and not funny. You can tell it is meant to be a comedic beat but I honestly was like &quot;that was a joke?&quot;.\n\nI thought the movie looked pretty good for the most part too.\n\nI would give it a watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Ay, carramba! A diablo of a marketing challenge: a bilingual movie, with an impossible-to-remember title, a story of white trash, Mexican wetbacks (that&apos;s the film&apos;s language), cruel Border Patrol &quot;cowboys,&quot; and Tommy Lee Jones as the director and the uniquely memorable lead character... and a film that&apos;s one of the year&apos;s best.\n\n&quot;The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada&quot; opens with a somewhat confusing sequence of flashbacks, and for the first half hour, you wish you were watching something more &quot;orderly,&quot; but you&apos;ll be hooked anyway. For the next hour and a half, however, there is a crescendo of images and situations hitting the viewer over the head, amazing and moving.\n\nTaking the corpse of a friend - and his very much alive killer - back to Mexico for a &quot;proper burial&quot; and to mete out justice, Jones&apos; voyage is a quirky, epic adventure, based on the brilliant writing of Guillermo Arriaga (of &quot;21 Grams&quot;), and filmed to perfection by Chris Menges (of &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; and &quot;The Mission&quot;).\n\nBesides Jones (who won the 2005 Cannes Festival best actor award for this), &quot;3 Burials&quot; features fabulous performances by Barry Pepper (&quot;25 Hours&quot;), Julio Cedillo, and a large group of remarkable supporting actors on both sides of the border.\n\nJones says something in the production notes that could sound arrogant or affected... except that it&apos;s true: &quot;Some visual influences have been the kabuki theater, the art of Donald Judd and Dan Flavin, and the films of Akira Kurasawa, Sam Peckinpah, and Jean-Luc Godard.&quot; Amen.",

      "reviewBody": "Typically, coming-of-age stories unfold in a predictable fashion: kid tentatively ventures into the world beyond the one he knows, where he encounters people and things that will change him and his outlook on life forever. It would be easy to dismiss Kill Your Darlings as yet another entry in a tired genre: the tale of a poet who finds his voice through a heady cocktail of sex, drugs and college. But John Krokidas&apos; debut feature film, which takes as its subjects the American poets of the revolutionary Beat Generation, fits in so much more, as it explores a haunting search for life and legacy that teeters close to the edge of death.\n\nAllen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) arrives at Columbia University keen to start a life away from the shadow of his famous dad, poet Louis Ginsberg (David Cross), and his mentally unstable mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh). He meets the electrifying Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), a rebel radiating so much charisma and ambition that it&apos;s easy to forget his lack of actual talent. Lucien brings together the aspiring artists who will soon come to change the literary world with their words: Allen, William S. Burroughs (Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston). As their lives intersect, their destinies intertwine, tangled up in the form of David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), a man hopelessly caught in Lucien&apos;s enthralling spell.\n\nKrokidas keeps this fascinating brew of hormones, hope and horror bubbling throughout, effectively nailing the champagne fizz of youth: a time when you could do ridiculous things, and remember them as romantic and revolutionary. Allen yearns, Jack drinks, William sucks nitrous oxide into his lungs in a bathtub, and Lucien keeps them all spinning. You don&apos;t have to know the Beat poets or their work to recognise the fire burning in these young men. Slicing and dicing pages of old classics, the boys make their manifesto quite literal: they will not rely on or succumb to tradition; their work will be conscribed by neither rhyme nor meter.\n\nThe most intriguing thing about Kill Your Darlings is that it refuses to romanticise this budding intellectual movement. The Beat poets may have become the idols of literary hipsters everywhere, but Krokidas takes care to tuck their ingenuity and creativity into the recognisable rhythms of everyday life. Desperate to hang onto Lucien&apos;s interest, Allen practically stumbles into his own talent. To create magic, he jerks off in front of his typewriter, or stupidly ties a noose around his neck to come a little closer to death. These young men, Krokidas seems to be saying, are treading a fine line between inspiration and tomfoolery. It&apos;s only when Allen recites a poem - on a moonlit night, on a stolen boat - that Lucien is comprehensively struck by his genius, as are we.\n\nWhen the film spins into darker, more murderous territory, it moves from coming-of-age story to crime thriller - a genre shift that, oddly, works quite well within the universe established by Krokidas, as it allows Allen to contemplate the darker, less palatable side of Lucien&apos;s volatile personality. But it also becomes that much harder to separate the facts of these characters from Krokidas&apos; fiction. David&apos;s tragic obsession with Lucien - one that the film suggests Allen could have shared - finally kicks off a tragic twist of events that unfold in a very particular way in Kill Your Darlings. Arguably, Allen ends up in an emotional place in the film that doesn&apos;t quite sit right with what actually transpired in real life, as told to us by a series of title cards just before the end credits.\n\nLess controversial is the young cast, all of whom do first-rate work in disentangling the complex web of relationships that exists amongst these characters. Radcliffe is still a mite stiff as an actor, but this is his best on-screen performance yet: brave, bold, and proof that he&apos;s willing to challenge anyone&apos;s ideas of what he can do on screen. DeHaan is a firecracker as the capricious Lucien, burning so brightly that it&apos;s no wonder the other characters can&apos;t tear themselves away from him. Hall gets to sound a note of quiet desolation as David, whose infatuation isn&apos;t played simply as the unrequited lust of a madman. Only Elizabeth Olsen - as Jack&apos;s long-suffering girlfriend - is called upon to play a stereotype.\n\nAll in all, Kill Your Darlings marks an impressive debut for Krokidas. Shaken and stirred with a gloriously jazzy soundtrack and a colour palette that shifts from light to murky in a heartbeat, the film practically radiates tension both sexual and intellectual. It might have a little trouble with the facts of the matter, but, taken on its own merits, this is a smart, intoxicating look at how adolescent dreams must necessarily give way to the chilling bite of reality.",

It&apos;s a story worth telling, though I felt it was a bit over-written and more complex than it needed to be. But my biggest problem was that the presentation was too heavy-handed. Even though this movie unbiasedly explored the perspectives of everyone involved, it left no room for the viewers to form their own opinions. We were spoon fed, and at times it had the feel of an after school special. From the writing, to the performances, to the music, everything was very literal. There was no subtext or anything to read into. Maybe the filmmakers accomplished exactly what they were going for. The overall style was consistent throughout and it seemed that the artists behind this mostly hit their mark. For my money, however, I prefer an approach that is more challenging. But 6 out of 10 is still a passing grade. This is a subject that needed to be acknowledged on screen and I do feel that it was handled with respect and fairness.",

You don&apos;t have to like the film but at the very least be original in your criticism.\n\nIt&apos;s clear to me people are losing their sense of realism with being glued to the enormous trend of superhero sci-fi films and unnecessary sequels. Cinema is also about intriguing dialogue with realistic earthly circumstances. Sometimes you need to appreciate a more realistic emotional story.\n\nThis film is simple yet at the same time complex as what most relationships are. Human emotion and romance isn&apos;t sappy or cheesy one liners you see in sitcoms. It&apos;s deep, its raw, its cruel, and it crosses boundaries.\n\nI give it a 7/10 overall it&apos;s a good film with excellent acting however the only critique I have with the film is that it remains the same with no unexpected twists or turns revealed.",

      "reviewBody": "This film kept me totally engaged during every single second. The acting was no less than you would expect from such a talented cast - brilliant performances from all. Ralph Fiennes is just superb. Gabriel Byrne in probably the most difficult role of his career to date keeps the `secret&apos; to the end.  John Neville and Lynn Redgrave, provide the supporting roles with a flare that never upstages the lead actors. Bradley Hall as the Boy Spider gave a fine performance as only child actors can. But it was the Chalk and Cheese characters play by Miranda Richardson that for me stole the show and clearly shows how deep her talents run.\n\nThe script, adapted by the author of the book, was powerful without going over the top and was very authentic. Even throwaway lines by supporting actors had meaning and helped convey the power and momentum of this masterpiece `.. seven packets of Crisps and a packet of Embassy.&apos; Many times have I uttered similar words in a London Pub.\n\nThe locations were so real, you could smell and tasted them - I grew up in such a places and in the same period as the Boy Spider - every single and highly accurate detail brought my childhood memories rushing back.\n\nThe story is real - events like the critical event in this film really did happen and still do.\n\nFor international readers, England from the late 70&apos;s onwards adopted a &apos;Care in the Community&apos; programme and every city and major town has halfway houses, like the one portrayed in this film, where newly released inmates of mental institutions are ordinarily just dumped to fend for themselves.\n\nThis film is nothing short of a Masterpiece - the real pity is that it won&apos;t appeal to a wider international audience.",

There are a lot of good stunts and chase scenes in this movie, as well as a long brawl towards the end with all the Cannonballers against a gang of bikers, led by Peter Fonda!\n\nTo quote the Brain Gremlin from Gremlins 2:  &quot;Check it out one time, won&apos;t you!&quot;  You won&apos;t be disappointed.",

That said, I was completely blown away and entertained from beginning to end. His voice and his dance moves are top form and timeless. He sang all his greatest hits, even from the J5 era, which really hit a soft spot with me. And people might be complaining that this isn&apos;t a typical concert movie...in truth, that is a big plus here. Typical concert movies are overly produced. The intimacy of this footage makes you feel, not like you&apos;re in a concert, but like you&apos;re witness to very private performances. You get to see first hand how involved this man was (to every little detail of production and planning). There are no crowds of screaming and crying fans to have to sit through (with the exception of a brief opening scene in which the auditioning dancers get a little too blubbery at times). This film easily reignited my appreciation for the man, who was without a doubt one of the greatest entertainers of our time. Complete 180 for me, I&apos;ll be the first to admit. And a side note, his female guitarist (her name escapes me) had me picking my jaw up off the floor, and not just her looks. You&apos;ll see what I mean.",

      "reviewBody": "Each with a young son who is being severely bullied at school. The idea of bullying is the point of departure for a look at related issues, especially the idea of revenge. The original Danish title was actually that single word---revenge. It was changed (the new title is somewhat of a stub ) for the International release, probably for the better, at least for the USA since the original title would probably conjure the notion of an action film with a minimum of delicacy instead of what it is, a rather heavy-hitting soap opera that deals with the inevitable emotional upheaval with a modicum of nuance here and there.\n\nThe movie asks how does one handle this sort of humiliating experience. This theme is enlarged by the fact that one of the fathers is a doctor who treats patients at a Sudanese refugee camp and has to deal with roving warlords. Back home this father makes what what comes across as a wise decision in turning the other cheek when he himself is bullied and lightly pushed around by a neighbor mainly because the offense was relatively light weight but could have escalated into something of a serious and perhaps far-reaching consequence.\n\nSo what do you do when such discretion is lost on your 10-year-old son who thinks you&apos;re a coward and calls you a wimp? The teleplay makes clear that domestic corporal punishment or no dessert for a week is not the answer, it wants to mean business and point to a more non-visceral response. This episode is thematically important and hits home with its direct simplicity and urgency but is subservient in scope to what these two young boys are up to.\n\nThere is backstory where a mother has died of cancer in one family, and a separation is in progress in the other, both that take a toll on the two young boys. Danish actress Trine Dyrholm pulls off an incredibly charged scene where she stumbles upon the neighboring boy in the hall of a hospital towards whom she has an uncontrollable and justifiable anger when she suddenly realizes that she is talking to a child, a child the same age as her own. The struggle in betraying a sudden compassion in such a circumstance is extraordinary.\n\nWisely, the teleplay imposes an interruption to the scene, otherwise the whole thing might have been ruined by either over sentimentality or rank incredulity. As is, it is terrific and I still have not been able to quite get it out of my mind.",

      "reviewBody": "Sure to be one of the best-loved films of this fall, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; adapted from Stephen King&apos;s best seller mines a lot of familiar territory from &quot;Stand by Me,&quot; but that beloved film is a good model.  In &quot;Stand by Me,&quot; it was a writer reflecting back on the childhood summer &quot;when we found the body,&quot; here it&apos;s David Morse as a photographer remembering the summer of his eleventh year &quot;when Ted the boarder moved upstairs.&quot;  Downplaying King&apos;s supernatural elements, this film slowly, but surely, builds to an emotional payoff every bit as moving as the end of Rob Reiner&apos;s gem.\n\nThis is a small, gentle film with lots of character development and period atmosphere.  The tech credits such as production design and cinematography are superb and bring to life a time--1960--which, for some of us, was not that long ago.  The child-actors are perfectly cast, and Anthony Hopkins as the mysterious stranger gives one of his best, most-heartfelt performances. (This guy could read USA Today weather forecasts aloud and make them sound like Shakespeare.)  While others may have taken a radically different approach to the material, emphasizing action and suspense, I think screenwriter William (&quot;Misery&quot;) Goldman and director Scott (&quot;Shine,&quot; &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot;) Hicks ultimately hit the right notes.  I will interested in seeing if this decidedly low-key approach strikes a box office chord with moviegoers frazzled by the big, dumb summer action films.  If there&apos;s any fairness left in the world it will.  It&apos;s that good."

      "reviewBody": "... and always form my own opinion. I took my 6 year old niece to see this movie today, and it was a perfect &quot;feel-good&quot; family holiday film. The original Annie came out in June of 1982 when I myself was 6, and I remember how much I loved the story and the singing, watching it (and singing along!) quite a few times in my childhood. Well, we sat down together last night to watch the original, and we BOTH had a hard time staying engaged throughout the whole thing. FDR and the New Deal? War bonds? Because the 1982 plot was set in the period of the comic&apos;s popularity, not the actual filming date of the movie, there were a lot of references that never did make sense to me growing up. The new movie, set in modern New York City, was relatable for today&apos;s kids (criticize all you want, but there are NOT ENOUGH positive non-Disney human characters out there, no matter how much people call it pandering). The script had its share of small flaws, and no one can ever outdo Burnett and Finney, but Wallis was adorable and very likable in the lead role... her personality was believable and not over the top, and oh yeah, she&apos;s black, though I don&apos;t think my niece noticed.",

This movie was very good as it entertained and kept you on the edge of your seat. This is a good escape from all the movies that are all explosions, blood and gore, fantasy, and vampire trash. This has a believable storyline even if the FX are a little unbelievable. You should watch this movie and enjoy it. Jude law is surprising in the role of the Capt. and is a great deal different than previous movie roles for him. The clash of personalities adds to the excitement through danger and mechanical malfunctions.",

Most of the film is your standard summer camp horror movie - though the body count is rather high - kids getting it on, pranks etc.\n\nI recommend this film for its 80s value AND shock ending, though now everybody has told you the ending is shocking then you will probably spend the whole movie trying to figure out what it is.",

      "name": "The Mundanities of Life",
      "reviewBody": "Life is strikingly uneventful for Willie, played by renaissance man John Lurie, who refers to himself as a hipster and lives in New York City, and his interactions with his Hungarian cousin Eva, played by avant-garde actress-musician Eszter Balint, and his best friend Eddie, played by yet another actor-musician Richard Edson, who dresses exactly like Willie. Indeed, both males are swarthy with hook noses and fedoras. They have such little interest in or knowledge of anything that their eventual vacation is no different from home.\n\nThe quirky way to three-act story format is a succession of single-shot scenes punctuated by black leader, and the clear-cut partition of the story into three straightforward, facetiously named episodes. Yet there are other ceremonial characteristics of substance: Tom DiCillo&apos;s black-and-white camera work, which provides Jarmusch&apos;s acute impression for the American panorama; and the arresting appliance of music, which favorably apposes Screamin&apos; Jay Hawkins&apos;s I Put a Spell on You with the folksy tinges of John Lurie&apos;s score for string quartet. This is definitely a road movie, but one with a distinction: Different from most instances of the then still immensely fashionable genre, Stranger Than Paradise appeared simultaneously comprehensively American and strangely European.\n\nThe oddly enlightening aggregate of involvement and reserve may be found in the film&apos;s lovingly absurd view of Willie&apos;s chic affectations, its quaint posture toward some of the inanities of American culture and in the way it harmonizes a decidedly American genre and decidedly American plot---if a narrative as gravely sparse and as concentrated on dead moments may be dubbed a plot---with all form of un-Hollywood expression. The look, rhythm, cast and mainly dismal feel bring to mind not The Blues Brothers, or even the rather subdued Last Detail, but the beginnings of the degree of minimalism to which Jarmusch would take his later work.\n\nHowever he also loves various attributes of popular culture. See how Willie and Eva watch Forbidden Planet on TV or go with Eddie and Eva&apos;s discouraged fancier to see a bone-crunching Hong Kong martial-arts flick at a Cleveland grindhouse, and lets them neighbor more virtuous aspects of his films, in such a way that there is no discrepancy between high and low. And it&apos;s for that scarce but wholly judicious mindset that Jarmusch is to be particularly noted. It&apos;s doable to distinguish his connection with a gamut of later American indie directors, specifically in his desert drollery, his passionately entertained captivation with slackers of sundry kinds, his concern with sequential framework, his affinity for severely subdued stories, and his clever, antiquated references to popular culture. All these, at a time scarce in American cinema, are now pretty ubiquitous. But the rhyme, the unabashed regard for cinema as a quality, production, expression, a realm, according to aesthetic principles, of what is beautiful, appealing, or of more than ordinary significance, even the mundanities of life and the most everyday scenery possible, that can confront crucial, important matters is far more difficult to come across.\n\nConsidering, in the end, no matter how amusing, stylized, minute or insignificant his films may strike one at first, they are always about something. For all his cinephilia, they&apos;re inspired not, like Tarantino and Rodriguez, by other movies, but by life: by real people, encountering real feelings. And while this black-and-white deadpan pop culture satire may be a comedy, an dissection of cinematic storytelling, and a thoroughly cynical yarn, it&apos;s also a film about America and the people who live there. It&apos;s about those people&apos;s connections to each other, and their connections to the rooms they populate, the city streets, the suburbs, diners and highways. And it&apos;s made by someone who knows there may be reality in abstraction, who finds a visceral alliteration separating a snow-coated Lake Erie and a barren Florida beach, and who fashions an implausibly true character like Aunt Lotte, always jabbering to her tender company in Hungarian, whether they&apos;re listening or not.",

      "reviewBody": "I loved the way Kid&apos;s presented itself when it was first released, if I had it my way then that film would be shown to all the kids in high school&apos;s all over the world because the reality of what is going on in each character really hits home when watching this and I think it might make a lot of young kids think before what they do.   Anyway that was my introduction to Larry Clark and the amazing Leo Fitzpatrick and when I had heard not long ago that these two got together and made another harrowing teen film called Bully I just had to watch it but apart of me wishes I didn&apos;t watch it because I scared me in a way because of how real it was.   Leo Fitzpatrick is not the lead star in this one though, this one is left to Brad Renfro (Marty) and Nick Stahl (Bobby) who are two best friends who live in world where they sell phone sex for gay people and make homosexual films to sell to porn shops, just you&apos;re average teenager of course, but Bobby is a dominating friend towards Marty and Marty just breaks and decides with his vulnerable girlfriend that they should kill Bobby so he won&apos;t be a problem in their lives, from there we are taken into this dark tale of teenage revenge. There is a big build to what happens in this film and that&apos;s what makes it harrowing viewing because you just don&apos;t know what is going to happen. But by the time the film had ended I straight away bombarded the internet with information about the real happening of what actually went on.\n\n Overall this is Larry Clark&apos;s best work to date and it opens you up to a whole new world of talented actors and a director that should be praised more about his work.   This is not the sort of film that finishes and you go on with what you are doing, it will stay in your head for a while and will leave wanting more in way because you really feel that you want the film to go on a bit longer to know more about these fascinating characters."

      "reviewBody": "The Last Kiss, a film by Tony Goldwyn (Yes son of Samuel Goldwyn) was adapted from the 2001 Italian film L&apos;Ultimo bacio, and written for the screen by none other than Paul Haggis. The Last Kiss goes through a number of relationships, spanning a number of different ages, and dissects the hardships of those relationships. Zach Braff seems to have upgraded his acting from Garden State and might actually become a more dexterous and talented actor than previously perceived. Paul Haggis&apos; wonderful dialog lends greatly to the reality and adversity that co-exist alluringly within this screenplay. This film has been incorrectly advertised as a romantic comedy that puts Braff in the middle of two girls, and he cannot decide which one he wants to continue his life with. This is simply not true. The film is about a group of people that have just seen what the rest of their lives are going to be like, and want to add a small bump in the road of life. Overall the film does a lot more than your average romantic comedy/buddy film, and shoves the afflictions and austerities of modern-day relationships in your face. This is not the greatest of date movies, like the trailer wants us to believe, and should be perceived as a more earnest and pensive film than it appears.",

There were some really funny parts, one involving the team needing to help out at the Italian kids family butcher shop, but overall, it just tried to hard to be a quirky movie that adults and kids would enjoy.\n\nAll in all, not Will Ferrel&apos;s best movie, but definitely not horrible.

It&apos;s a question if you enjoy the ride to get there.  And I did.\n\nAlthough being a teen comedy (which always means an obligatory puke scene), and some physical comedy which was a little distracting, this film was just fun.  The film works cause everyone can think back to the days in high school when you worshiped a band, played their music, and would DIE to see them play live, and this film captures that feeling perfectly.  It also captures the era perfectly with the music, cars, good soundtrack, and the pot shots at of course... disco (Did you see those SHOES the disco chicks were wearing??).  And of course it was VERY funny in places (I thought my jam sessions were bad...).\n\nAlso the film had me guessing as to what would happen, sometimes I thought it was predictable, then it switched gears and surprised me, particularly the ending which was so perfectly sweet!!  Perfect music high school camradare done wonderfully.  Even though I am not a fan of KISS, everyone can think back to the time when your fav band was your TRUE means of salvation.\n\nRating 7 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "A team-building weekend in the mountains of Eastern Europe goes horribly wrong for the sales division of the multi-national weapons company Palisade Defence when they become the victims of a group of crazed killers who will stop at nothing to see them dead.\n\nI recall this film coming out in 2006 and getting a lot of positive buzz from horror fans. For one reason or another, I never ended up watching it until now (March 2013). And I must say, the buzz was probably correct -- while not among the best horror films out there, it sure is well above average.\n\nThe trick of this film is that it is a horror film, but only in its feeling. Terrorists, a bus flipping over, guns and bombs... that is an action film. This should be an action comedy. But the style is definitely in the horror vein, with the way certain things are presented (particularly the bear trap). What makes a horror film a horror film? That question has been asked many times, and I think this film definitely makes you wonder.\n\nAlthough many of the references were lost on me, I now know (from looking into the production) that many of the scenes were evoking Kubrick (&quot;2001&quot;, &quot;Strangelove&quot; and &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;) and other notable directors. I love it. I love the subtlety of these homages... the &quot;Clockwork&quot; scene was clear to me, but I also am probably most familiar with that Kubrick film (although I have seen them all at least once).\n\nI would need to see this again to fully review it, but my initial impression is that it is a great blend of action, humor and horror. Well worth a look.",

(4) Phones off the hook, and an empty house with the lights out. (5) A recliner with a seat belt. (6) 96 minutes of your time.\n\nI am 30 year old factory worker who loves NASCAR and Hockey and own 3 carbureted cars - 1 parked in my backyard that hasn&apos;t ran in 2 years AND I could probably pass for the guy who might spit as I offer you confusing directions if you stopped to ask, but I have never seen anything anywhere remotely close to this masterpiece. It&apos;s so good that it runs through my head while I&apos;m slugging away at work covered in factory germs. The Burgan oil fires (the fire we possess) to the Australian steel workers (our ongoing need to keep the fire going) to the Auschwitz gas ovens (what we choose to do with it) is pure cinematic genius. For me, the Whirling Dervishes forward is my favorite scene. Where it slides from the mosque in Mecca to the cathedral ceiling at the Vatican is absolutely mind-bending. I feel like crying every time I watch it, yet I&apos;m not all that religious.\n\nAside from all this film brings with it, it&apos;s not for everyone, and I can understand that. I was 17 when it came out and probably could have cared less. But for a blue-collar hick in need of a shave like me, I&apos;d take this movie to prison if I was allowed.\n\nWhen you see it for the first time, don&apos;t ask questions. Turn the volume up as loud as you can and just watch it. Baraka will provide you with everything you need. 10 thumbs out of 10, and not just up, but way up. Can&apos;t wait for the sequel.",

David Duchovny and Demi Moore are fantastic as Kate and Steve Jones, the seemingly perfect couple in the ridiculously perfect neighborhood. I especially liked the way in which the director, Derrick Borte, conveyed a feeling to the audience that something just isn&apos;t quite right with this family. This movie really makes you think about what you buy and why exactly you buy it. It was highly entertaining and also had an important and rather satirical message about American consumerism and the art of &quot;keeping up with the Joneses.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "I had a decent time with this movie. It&apos;s nothing special but is mostly enjoyable. The best part is the cast. I love Jessica Chastain. Diane Kruger gives a good performance. Lupita Nyong&apos;o is kind of a beast; she kills the emotional moments. The action is fun and I was never bored.\n\nThere are also a ton of flaws. The fight scenes are super choppy with lots of quick cuts. So many moments are fully predictable. They try to have a message but in the clunkiest of ways. Like this line, &quot;We all look different, we speak different, but we are the same.&quot; I love me a message about unity and I despise racism, but you gotta do better than that. And there are a couple moments where I burst out laughing at an unintentionally hilarious moment, like one involving a perfume bottle.\n\nI also can&apos;t stand when a movie has stuff in the script that belongs in a rated R movie but they want to sell to a wider audience so they hide things and cut away. It&apos;s so noticeable and takes me out of the movie. Either remove those parts completely, or just go for it and make it rated R. Most movie fans including myself would enjoy it more and respect it more. And maybe it wouldn&apos;t have been such a flop at the box office.\n\nIn the end, I&apos;m glad I watched this but I doubt I&apos;d revisit it. Although I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;d watch a sequel. Just please hire a good fight director and just go all in with an R-rating.\n\nRandom side note, does anyone else think the actor who plays Luis looks like a Latino Gerard Butler?\n\nAnother side note, why is Lupita Nyong&apos;o 17th on the list of actors on IMDb? She should be third at worst, if not second. And I don&apos;t mean the full list which is in order of appearance. This is on the main page for The 355. Seems fishy. (1 viewing, 3/12/2022)",

It&apos;s aiming to be a cult classic film but missed the mark a bit. Also, not that funny which was disappointing but it had some jump scares and gruesome deaths so I was still engaged the whole time.",

      "reviewBody": "I love Shia LaBeouf, I really do. I&apos;ll watch basically anything he puts his name to. The man blew up his own career by being too honest, and I respect him immensely for that. I didn&apos;t actually realise going in to &apos;Honey Boy&apos; that it was him telling a very personal and true story abut the relationship he had with his father. I worked it out very quickly though that that was what was being portrayed. It can&apos;t be easy to write a film like this, but LaBeouf does a terrific job of presenting how he perceived things, without ever feeling like he&apos;s trying to ram a point down your throat.\n\nThe acting in this film is incredible. Firstly LaBeouf playing his father is truly mesmerising. Sure he knew the guy better than anyone, but that isn&apos;t enough to justify just how phenomenal he was in this film. I&apos;m surprised he didn&apos;t get a lot more love during awards season. Lucas Hedges also really impressed me. Within 30 seconds of him being on screen I was able to say, &quot;That guy is playing LaBeouf.&quot; He mimicked him perfectly in voice and actions. Finally Noah Jupe blew me away. What an incredibly difficult performance for a child actor to have to pull off. This is no ordinary kid he was playing. He was superb and also deserves every bit of recognition he gets.\n\nThis is clearly an extremely personal film for LaBeouf. He has laid his heart and soul out on the table. The result is a very good film that is well worth your time, whether you&apos;re a LaBeouf fan or not. I recommend checking this one out.",

A recent Hollywood fashion is an attitude like &quot;Hey, let&apos;s get something that worked in the past, cut some stupid expenses like a decent screenwriter, and let&apos;s be back in the big bucks again! Just put in some expensive-looking effects and the morons won&apos;t notice!&quot; - Matrix 2.1 and 2.2 as a case in point. And the effects are marginally under standard, too.

      "reviewBody": "Undeniably amongst the most powerful, provocative &amp; pragmatic narratives to surface on the silver screen in recent years, Mustang is a beautifully balanced blend of skillful direction, sensible writing &amp; terrific performances that takes a much-needed dig at patriarchy &amp; conservatism and also works as a joyful celebration of sisterhood.\n\nSet in a small Turkish village, the story of Mustang follows five young orphaned sisters whose lives are changed completely when they are caught innocently playing with some boys on a beach, after which their conservative family bars them from going to school anymore and begins marrying them off one by one without their consent.\n\nCo-written &amp; directed by Deniz Gamze Ergüven in what is actually her feature film debut, Mustang takes only a few minutes to establish the strong bond between the siblings before stepping into the realm of absurd social &amp; cultural restraints that snatches away their freedom in the blink of an eye and every restriction imposed upon them turns out to be both nonsensical &amp; unnerving.\n\nThe screenplay is no slouch either for it packs in an engaging storyline that smoothly unfolds over the course of its runtime and is filled with meaty characters whose arcs are well-defined plus they exhibit surprising depths. Ergüven&apos;s never goes in-your-face with her critical stance on orthodox mentality but simply exposes the challenges women face when growing up in such communities. \n\nThe technical aspects are thoroughly refined and work in harmony to further uplift the film&apos;s tone &amp; ambiance to its desired level. Camera is expertly utilised, always keeping its focus on the relevant characters, while the bright colour palette reflects the strength &amp; joy the sisters find in each other&apos;s company even in the bleakest of circumstances. And editing is immaculately carried out as well for every sequence plays a vital role in the story.\n\nComing to the performances, Mustang features a relatively inexperienced cast but the contribution from the five girls who play siblings in this feature is a highlight in itself. The scripted characters do have some flesh on them, thus providing a solid platform for the actors to built their performances upon but they further up the ante by delivering wonderfully layered &amp; highly convincing inputs that makes all the relevant characters in the film stand out.\n\nThe story is told from the perspective of Lale, the youngest of the five siblings, and it&apos;s through her eyes that we witness the injustice she &amp; her sisters are subjected to yet what keeps them together is their common passion for freedom &amp; constant pursuit of ways to bypass the restrictions imposed upon them by the elders. And it is this rebellious nature that slowly accumulates as plot progresses &amp; finally concludes with an act of self-preservation that finishes the tale on a hopeful note.\n\nOn an overall scale, Mustang is an ingeniously crafted, meticulously layered &amp; deftly measured cinema that&apos;s engaging, entertaining &amp; enlightening on more levels than one and for a first time filmmaker, it&apos;s an incredibly polished effort. Ergüven&apos;s direction exudes both confidence &amp; composure and the story as a whole manages to make its voice heard loud &amp; clear. A fearless celebration of womanhood &amp; a heartfelt rendition of the indomitable will of human spirit, Mustang is a timely &amp; welcome coming- of-age story and is essential viewing in every sense of the word. Don&apos;t miss it!"

Enjoy watching this movie.Before releasing this movie kamal hassan faced so many political, theatrical threat to release the movie. Because he has planned to release this movie in DTH(Direct to home). If that would have happened, then it would have made a history in Indian cinema. For this DTH release all the theater owners and the distributor association opposed. Finally they made a speech with kamal hassan and it was decided that the movie will be released in theater first, then it will be in DTH. After that some political parties gave threat to release this movie. So tamilnadu government put stay to release this movie.After its release all around the world except tamilnadu the movie got full positive reviews only...Proud to be a kamal hassan fan..",

      "name": "Amazing Grand Guignol Horror Film!",
      "reviewBody": "Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is one of the most misunderstood movies of all time. I saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 when it was released in theaters back in 1986. I loved this horror flick then. But everyone else hated it. Critics trashed it. Even many horror fans, of the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre or slashers in general, hated it and dismissed it. Now after a decade or so after its release, TCM 2 is now a bona fide cult movie.\n\nThere are so many things to point out why TCM 2 is a stand-out. The first and most important thing to point out is that back in the 1980s, horror films were reduced to simple slashers. TCM 2 is totally different than the plethora of slashers that many horror fans expected to see, which is one reason why many horror fans didn&apos;t get it. The body count is extremely low in TCM 2 compared to the Friday the 13th or Elm Street flicks. But that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not violent. No, it&apos;s VERY violent. But the violence in TCM 2 is more engrossing, shocking and even at times funny, and in turn less acceptable than the unreal violence found in many slasher films. Because of the amount of violence and violent imagery, films critics trashed TCM 2, pointing out how the first film didn&apos;t rely on gore and violence to scare the audience.\n\nI love Texas Chainsaw Massacre as much as I love TCM 2. I understand what the critics were saying. Unfortunately, they didn&apos;t get the point of the violence in TCM 2. While TCM is a sweat inducing TERRIFYING horror film in the first order, TCM 2 is a &quot;GRAND GUIGNOL HORROR&quot; horror film in the first order. In TCM 2, Hooper creates a vast canvas of baroque imagery, where we watch the insane and gory story unfold before our incredulous eyes. I&apos;m amazed that critics missed the whole difference between TCM and TCM 2. It&apos;s odd that critics will rave about Peter Greenaway&apos;s &quot;THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE &amp; HER LOVER&quot; which is a twisted drama in the the Grand Guignol style, but didn&apos;t see TCM 2 in the same way. It&apos;s probably due to the fact that TCM 2 is a sequel to a quasi-legendary horror film and everyone expected the sequel to be the same as the first movie.\n\nI give credit to everyone involved with TCM 2. They actually TRIED to do something different: different from the equally great TCM, different from the increasingly boring horror films of the 80s. And in my eye, they&apos;ve succeeded. There are so many memorable scenes in TCM 2, some of which are the most amazing horror moments ever put on screen (when Leatherface tries to put the scalped face on Stretch, the scene when Stretch finds her friend sans face, etc). And there are so many quotable lines too. TCM 2 is also a very funny film (&quot;Rain, rain, rain, rain...&quot; Choptop says as he checks out records at the radio station).\n\nTCM 2 is not perfect. The ending is abrupt. And the chainsaw fight at the end is too short. Dennis Hopper is a bit hard to take as a &quot;hero.&quot; But he does play the &quot;twisted hero&quot; right. It&apos;s just difficult to see him fighting big and burly Leatherface. BTW, the very last image of TCM 2 is Strecth dancing with a chainsaw in her hands at the top of that amusement park structure. In the original film (and the original video release), we can see cars and trucks driving by on a highway in the distance. On the DVD, they cropped this shot and we don&apos;t see the traffic anymore. Personally, I thought it added a LOT to the whole surreal aspect of the film. Like the world was continuing on with its relentless pace, no matter what had just happened that night. I wished they didn&apos;t crop this shot on the DVD. Oh well...\n\nIt&apos;s a shame few people &quot;got&quot; TCM 2 back then. After reading the reviews at IMDb and at Amazon, it&apos;s great to see that some are finally &quot;getting it.&quot; For anyone who&apos;s game, watch TCM 2. You&apos;ll be squealing in horror and laughing at the insanity of it all in equal amounts.",

It is great, because it humanizes drug addicts. it shows that a speed freak is never just a speed freak, but a person with a life in distress. too often people with drug addictions are dismissed as eyesores or vagabonds who deserve harsh treatment, but the movie takes us into their lives. Most Importantly, the characters are not supposed to be heroes, they are just a cross-section of junkie culture. plus, the scenes with the cops are hilarious, and seeing Debbie Harry throw a six-pack at a guy&apos;s head and then kick him in the gut was priceless. To review, deals with oft over-looked subject matter in an objective way, some great cameos, imaginative film-making, I give it an A-Plus.",

Of all the ones that predate The Accused, Not many push as far into the red zone as this. As you go back through the decades of Hollywood cinema, films get more and more censored. In parts, The Accused is quite brutal. It would probably have seemed even more so to those who viewed it upon release 20 years ago. There are two trials in this movie. For the first, the accused persons have been charged with rape. For the second, the accused persons (different people) are charged with the crime of cheering it on (to put it in more casual terms). What the movie gives us a taste of is extremely inhumane, worse than murder even. That and two good actresses at the top of their game, results in a credible, involving courtroom drama. The screenplay is a tad over written in some places, so it&apos;s not a brilliant movie, but it is a fine specimen to sample for those who enjoy this genre.",

      "reviewBody": "With a title like &apos;Excorcist 3&apos;, one doesn&apos;t hope for much. But in fact, this film is really only so titled to exploit the value attached with the name, and although it was written (and also directed) by the writer of the original film, it&apos;s actually a stand-alone movie in it&apos;s own right. And while William Blatty may be hard pushed to rival the efforts of the original&apos;s director, William Friedkin, he doesn&apos;t do too bad a job: he&apos;s a little over-reliant on abrupt cutting to achieve his shocks, and the budget for the special effects was obviously inadequate, but this is a suspenseful and chilling thriller. All supernatural movies suffer from a degree of innate silliness, and satanic movies perhaps especially so, but this film is constructed as if it was a conventional serial killer thriller, albeit an exceptionally dark and creepy one. As the signs of actual devilry begin to increase, the detective leading the case (played brilliantly by George Scott) starts to wonder if he&apos;s going mad. Only when the film is forced, near its conclusion, to represent the nightmare literally, does it inevitably become a little daft (but that charge could even be levied at &apos;The Excorcist&apos; itself). I&apos;m not generally a huge fan of horror movies, but this one is definitely above average, for its skill in modulating the tension and in restraining from excess until its final scenes. In conclusion, ignore the title, and watch.",

This was one of the first movies I saw in 1990 knowing who Jean Claude Van Damme was, after previously seeing &quot;Blood Sport&quot; and &quot;Kickboxer&quot;. Along with those two this helped set him on the road to stardom. Watching it today, I still think it is one of his best performances and best movies in general. Sure it&apos;s cheaply made and some of the acting is a bit dodgy but it&apos;s a lot of fun.\n\nPlot In A Paragraph: Leon Gaultier is a deserter from the Foreign Legion arriving in New York . He finds his brother at death&apos;s door in L.A and his sister-in-law without the money needed to pay for medical care for her husband and to maintain her child. To earn the money needed, Gaultier decides to take part in some very dangerous under ground fights. \n\nWhilst Van Damme is the star, Harrison Page steals the show as his friend/manager Joshua, I think he is fantastic. Having previously starred opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sly Stallone, Brian Thompson stars opposite the new action star in the block (at the time) Deborah Rennard does a fine job as Cynthia.",

Outside of some nice camera-work and a good soundtrack, this was an hour and a half of pointless,cynical faffing around that would have done better as a short film. \n\nThe premise of Rubber is interesting, but does not carry the whole film. There are only so many times I can watch a tire roll around from different angles and explode heads, after which point it becomes excessive, gory and just plain boring. Films of course should convey a message, but they are at their heart entertainment. If you can&apos;t engage your audience (why are we watching a film based on no reason?) and we have no characters to become invested in, the film isn&apos;t good. \n\nIf we take Rubber as a discussion of Hollywood movies and mass media in general, how they are mindless, violent for no reason and feed on their audiences, continuing as long someone is watching (reality TV/blockbusters) and as time goes on becomes destructive and inane, that is an incredibly interesting topic to deal with and thats the worst part. Rubber could have been an incredibly interesting film, but instead it relied on poor acting, poor dialogue and constantly shoving metaphor and absurdity in our face. There is no subtlety at all. We are constantly told the film is pointless, not real etc etc. So why are we watching? The film hates movies, hates its audience which it poisons for being interested. Its so cynical you are left wondering, if cinema is so bad, instead of complaining about it, why don&apos;t they just make a good film?",

      "reviewBody": "I was excited to watch this movie, Netflix has been making decent rom-coms lately and this plot had a teenage-catcher plot that no one can&apos;t deny. The movie starts good, the characters are great, but I want to focus on Sierra: \n\nThey didn&apos;t give her qualities for you to make you feel connected to that character. I&apos;m not talking about popularity, I&apos;m talking about quirks, things they like to do that make her look interesting. Yeah, she is a cute nerd, she is a kind girl (most part of the movie) but apart from that, what&apos;s her catch? What makes her special? Does she like to spend her weekend reading? Give me something. They didn&apos;t even give her insecurities importance, only mentioned once.\n\nThey mention -emphasis on the mention- she likes to sing but during the movie she only does once. She sings a beautiful song, at the last 10 minutes of the movie... Thank you. It still wasn&apos;t enough to make you feel connected with her after what she did to her friend in the movie. (I&apos;m trying not to spoil here) and, after what she did, the conflict was solved in like, 30 seconds. Wtf. \n\nHer character is boring. Her relationship with Jamey is boring and not believable at all. Wow, they connected sending each other&apos;s pictures of animals. How romantic -sarcasm alert- and to wrap it all, she end up being a jerk, and for me, only jerks are losers. So yes, Sierra is indeed a loser.\n\nNow, let&apos;s get to the other characters. \n\nI liked Jamey&apos;s character and Dan&apos;s, they are well portrayed. Thumbs up. \n\nBut last but not least, Veronica. She steals the sentimental catch. She ends up being the character with more sentimental appeal. When she takes her bad-girl-mask she is actually a better person than Sierra.\n\nIn the middle of the movie I thought Veronica was going to end up with Jamey instead because there was more chemistry between them than with Sierra. Veronica was too kind to Sierra, really. \n\nOverall, I wouldn&apos;t watch the movie again, a good idea with an average/bad team behind it. A recommendation to Netflix, a good script changes with a decent director is everything, every word counts.",

It&apos;s all been seen before in earlier, more original movies. This one is kind of a &quot;best of&quot; reel of some good ideas from other horror movies. If you&apos;re looking for something original and scary, this isn&apos;t it. If you&apos;re looking for a little jumpy fun, I can&apos;t say this one is a miss. By virtue of the &quot;good ideas&quot; being good, they work. What it lacks in originality it makes up for in assembling them in a reasonably coherent manner.\n\nMy only real gripe is that Dylan McDermitt looks about as out of place working the fields of his farm as any actor I can think of. They could have at least tried a LITTLE bit harder casting that part.\n\nThink The Birds + Ju On + Amityville Horror + Sixth Sense.",

The story takes place four years after the events of part one. A guilt ridden Korean soldier now living as a refugee in Hongkong is sent along with four fellas to retrieve a truck full of money from the quarantined Korea now inhabited by zombies. Comparison to Mad Max, Doomsday, Fast n Furious will crop up everywhere. But the point is, is it entertaining? O yeah! Tons of car chase n gun action sequences. Fans of Train to Busan like me will b disappointed. The social commentary, the emotions, the characters n most importantly the zombie stuff is missing here. The climax scene in slow mo with melodrama gets on ur nerves. Watch out for the UN&apos;s major Jane. Her dialogue delivery n the way she runs is hilarious. So far actor Geoffrey Giuliano was the top choice to play white actor&apos;s role in Thai films n finally he landed a role in this film too.",

Poppy is a teacher, a good laugh, a bit of a loon and a really annoying person all rolled into one but try as you might you won&apos;t hold that against her. She is an unexpectedly cute cross between Michaela Strachan and Frank Spencer. Thankfully, there&apos;s no beret but there are plenty of knockabout gags which, when coupled with Poppy&apos;s infectious giggling and quick asides, had the audience laughing along quite genuinely. Characters come and go throughout the movie with an especially good performance from Stanley Townsend, but it&apos;s Eddie Marsan who gives the stand out performance in the movie with his darkly obsessive narratives and non sequiturs which expose his sinister persona. The rest of the cast are also splendid, they all fit in just right to make this a very watchable and enjoyable movie. Even the two dimensional characters have good aspects for which they are easily forgiven. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate in recommending people to this movie, my only complaint being that it was over too soon. I could have watched how the characters developed for another day or two and I guess that&apos;s down to the fascination with the ordinary which Mike Leigh builds into his films.",

The adaptation of Arthur Miller&apos;s play is superb.\n\nJoan Allen deserved her nomination for the Oscar as best supporting actress and Daniel Day-Lewis should have been nominated.\n\nA must see.\n\nRating: 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "I just came from an advance screening of Astroboy where I dutifully took my kids at 10 am to watch &quot;this&quot; thinking that if I was lucky I would be able to doze off for a few minutes during the movie. Boy, I couldn&apos;t! The story was captivating from the beginning. Yes, it was very directed at kids, you know, the far off humour and such, but when I saw Toby, the genius&apos; &quot;kid&quot;, I felt that the movie was after all NOT just a Pinocchio rip-off where an old man made a robot-boy because he was bored or lonely... the reasons behind the creation of Astroboy were tragic and even mature. Of course, if you are a manga aficionado, you may be thinking &quot;duh! that&apos;s how&apos;s supposed to be&quot;, but I am NOT. I barely watched a show now and then when I was a kid (I&apos;m 36 years old... too young for Astroboy), so I wasn&apos;t really aware of the story. So I thought, well, this development has to be a fluke inherited from the original story, from then on it should go downhill... but it did NOT. The story is full of tragedy, though decisions that if you think them through you can even understand (like a father understanding that memories cannot truly replace his son), and redemption that may be obvious to superheroes experts, but are very well exposed to a new generation of kids that will witness a clear fight between good and evil (positive and negative forces) adorned with an excellent and adequate portion of comedy. Not just a kid&apos;s movie, but a movie that I will surely watch again when my kids &quot;force&quot; me to buy it and to watch it with them dozens of times. Go, Astro!",

It may come as little surprise that the &apos;church&apos; actually provides specialized training and drills to help its spokesmen deliver blatant lies more believably.\n\nThe moral justification for telling these lies is built-in to Scientology and separates it from every other &apos;religion&apos; except for (predictably) Satanism, namely the fact that there is no overriding moral code forbidding murder, bearing false witness and the like.\n\nHubbard wrote materials expressly for the public intended to give the appearance of morality and decency, but ultimately, whatever profits the &apos;church&apos; is Good and whatever &apos;impedes&apos; it is Evil and no holds are barred where either is concerned. The result is the nightmare that is Scientology.",

It was neat!) and believe me, the characters are not only believable, you can meet versions of them in small towns all through the south.\n\nThere is a big difference between city and deep country life. Maybe people in very urban areas and countries tend to forget that. Quite honestly, I know several people down here in the boonies who make the folk of &quot;Grady&quot; look downright sophisticated.\n\nThat criticism shot down, I just have to say it&apos;s a really sweet film.

But in a world where old Charlie Chan pot-boilers have a cult following, and boneheaded Spielberg spectaculars are considered works of genius, I&apos;d say that Whiteout definitely has a place.\n\nWhat did I like about Whiteout? I loved the setting. ANY movie set in the confines of an Antarctic research station is okay with me. (There aren&apos;t nearly enough of them!) I loved the characters. Kate Beckinsale isn&apos;t in the front ranks of thespians, but she&apos;s a solid leading lady, and brings a good mix of likability, vulnerability and toughness to this part. The supporting characters are just fine as well. I loved the idea of setting an action-mystery in this odd locale, and I greatly enjoyed the way the mystery unraveled - predictable though it may have been. And I loved the various ways that the frozen environment is brought in as an element in the story.\n\nWhat did I hate? Not a thing. True, the cold is not treated realistically. Too many people walking around bareheaded and such. Yes, it&apos;s a dopey Hollywood convention. But in a little action flick like this one, I wasn&apos;t bothered - at all. Did I hate the acting? No. It was just right for this kind of film. Did I have problems with the writing? Okay... there were a few bits of logic that could have been tighter. But, again, no worse than in many movies that get a 10/10 from every blockhead on Earth. (I won&apos;t itemize... this review is going to get enough down-checks as it is.)\n\nBottom line, Whiteout is a pile of fun. It&apos;s a &apos;genre&apos; film, with few if any artistic pretensions. But it delivers the goods where it counts. I&apos;ve watched it several times on DVD, and expect to enjoy it quite a few more. If you don&apos;t get it, go watch some Merchant-Ivory drawing room masterpiece, and we&apos;ll all be happy.",

      "reviewBody": "This film, it is true, requires little brainpower. It is, however, light and fun fare, particularly for teenagers. Moore is adequate but not stellar as the President&apos;s whiny daughter. My biggest complaint with the movie is that her repeated comments about wanting &quot;freedom&quot; get old very quickly, and she comes off as a spoiled brat, but that&apos;s more the fault of the writing, not Moore. Matthew Goode in his breakout performance is far more charming, showing off a relaxed, witty presence that make his character well worth watching (and if his performance isn&apos;t enough, his looks should be!). The sub-love-story of Moore&apos;s two bodyguards, Weiss and Morales, is also funny and at times more interesting than the lead characters themselves. The scenery easily makes up for the lack of depth. All in all, it&apos;s a cute and entertaining film and at times is outright funny. Worth watching and even buying, for times when you&apos;re not in mood for heavy drama!\n\n&quot;I...want to swim naked...in the Danube!&quot; &quot;Actually, it&apos;s the Vltava.&quot; &quot;Who says they want to swim naked in the Vltava? Nobody says that.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s because Vltava is Polish for &apos;unhealthy bacteria level&apos;!&quot;"

There are some great sequences in here, with great visuals and graphics, very visually appealing and even informative.\n\nThe storyline admittedly is very predictable, and the script is nothing out of this world, however it&apos;s fun and realistic, and you feel as though you really meet these characters. What it misses is focus, as the story has 2 different storylines, the one about Cole as a DJ being much stronger, and maybe it would have profited for cutting down on the scenes with friends. Although there are some gems there, it&apos;s been done many times before and the ending of that storyline is very predictable.\n\nNow although this was never going to get any Oscars, it&apos;s still a good and entertaining tale of coming of age tale, and what it lacks in originality, it makes up for with a great soundtrack and pure heart coupled with a great performance by Efron.\n\nP.S. The quotes from the movie might be laughable to some, but as a late stage millennial, I feel that quotes like &quot;are we ever gonna be better than this?&quot; and &quot;This is the best part. The best part of anything really. It&apos;s the moment before it starts.&quot; are as real and contemporary as they get",

Clearly, that alone makes this film worth your time and worth forming your own opinion about.\n\nThe thing is, this is not a stupid film by any means. &apos;Visually stunning,&apos; it is constantly called, but it&apos;s not just that: It&apos;s an assault on the senses (in a good way), both visually and aurally. The sound is incredible, the images stick with you. Even a simple, seemingly underthought image like the final two shots of the movie will stick with you long after the closing credits roll.\n\nBut how is the story? I haven&apos;t seen the original in years, but this one held my attention, and kept my brain engaged. I remember not liking the first one when I first saw it (too many scenes of nothing moving, while we listened to voice-over), but I give this one an enthusiastic thumbs up, plus a wink and a smile. It FEELS like the middle chapter in a story... there is too much left unresolved, and while seeing the first one isn&apos;t necessary to understanding this one, there ARE many references the original &quot;Ghost in the Shell.&quot; It&apos;s not so much a continuation of the story, as it is a continuation of the characters. Which I think is the better call.\n\nConstant quotes from literature is not a sign of intellectual weakness, I don&apos;t think. People accuse the movie of not having a brain of its own, but I think any movie that engages the brain of its audience needn&apos;t make apologies. This one remains interesting on all levels; I just hope it doesn&apos;t take them another nine years to produce part three.\n\n10/10",

The views on this case are polarized and often hardened, so how to make a movie about it? Vishal Bhardwaj and Meghna Guzzal took the time to scrupulously research the case, and present a Rashomon-like telling of the story with multiple viewpoints, allowing the viewer to conclude which case is most compelling.\n\nThe acting is superb, and despite the many details, the editing it tight so that the movie is gripping from start to finish. Highly recommended.\n\nFor those who want to go deeper into the case, and into the trial that followed (which isn&apos;t covered in the movie), Avirook Sen&apos;s 2015 book &quot;Aarushi&quot; is detailed deconstruction of the case.",

      "reviewBody": "Nations do not fight wars. Citizens fight them, and these citizens are honorable men and women who serve their country willingly or, as history shows, by decree of a desperate government.\n\nAs a result, patriotism has become the unlikeliest casualty. Once welcomed in the trenches of battle, patriotism has lost its limbs, fought back from life support, and suffered shell shock. Once easily recognized, patriotism has become a bit of a chimera, an ideal more easily attached to definable characteristics than it is any single soldier. However, in the bitter end, patriotism is defined by the actions of these individuals who serve; it is rewarded by the nations who sponsor this service; and, more often than not, it is measured in hardships endured.\n\nSuch is the complex, ever-changing battleground of writer/director Kang Je-Gyu&apos;s &apos;Taegukgi: The Brotherhood of War.&apos;\n\nIn 1950&apos;s Seoul, Jin-Seok (Won Bin) and his older brother Jin-Tae (Jang Dong-gun) are enjoying a strong family life of perfect happiness. Suddenly, they find their lives turned upside down as soldiers of the South Korean government seize them  all men aged 18 to 30 are taken  and they are forced to take up arms  despite their lack of training  against the approaching North Koreans. On one brutal battlefield after another, the bonds of family are put to increasingly demanding tests as Jin-Tae  originally driven by his responsibility to protect his younger brother  continues to further exhaust his physical and emotional prowess despite the protests of Jin-Seok. He learns that he is a good soldier, one with a talent for inspiring others as well as an unanticipated thirst for killing the enemy. Eventually, these two brothers  once bound by a love for family  find themselves at odds within this new brotherhood of war, and the pressures to prove one another continue to exact heavier and heavier tolls as the war escalates. As circumstances evolve, the brothers inevitably find themselves on opposite sides of a losing conflict  but can either find a path to redemption or reconciliation that can save both of them?\n\nThere are many elements of &apos;Taegukgi&apos; that elevate the film from the status of standard war film to a message of hope set against the backdrop of war. The film&apos;s scope is grand, dealing with the far more intimate themes of family, brotherhood, and personal responsibility when Director Kang Je-Gyu could have easily opted for banging the drum of nationalism. At its core, &apos;Taegukgi&apos; is the story of two brothers, a strikingly poignant analogy for the entire North Korea / South Korea dilemma. While the battlefield choreography is as frenetic as it is harrowing, it never takes the film&apos;s center: this picture is founded on relationships  the human perspective to the world outside  and it never falters. Instead of focusing on history, Kang Je-Gyu crafts every scene to highlight the thoughts, actions, and emotions of the participants of history, and, for that, &apos;Taegukgi&apos; deserves countless accolades.\n\nMuch like exploring the heart of darkness as depicted in American classics as Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s &apos;Apocalypse Now&apos; and Oliver Stone&apos;s &apos;Platoon,&apos; Kang Je-Gyu forces Jin-tae to explore his own budding evil, and this journey is not without its own relative scars. Once a man has crossed over and embraced wartime madness, can he ever truly find a way out? Arguably, if &apos;Taegukgi&apos; suffers from any setback, it is that perhaps Jin-tae goes too far for an audience to accept his madness: believing his brother to have been killed by North Koreans, Jin-tae turns traitor once he is captured and seeks to wipe out every soldier serving South Korea. While the story offers the motivation for so drastic a change, it&apos;s hard to believe that the man who once fought so valiantly against the spread of Communism would suddenly choose to embrace it.\n\nStill, it&apos;s a small diversion  but it&apos;s necessary to bring the aspect of brotherhood full circle, to have these two unique men face their darkest hour, and to make one final statement on the role that family inevitably plays in every man&apos;s life.\n\nRecently, thanks to the worldwide success of &apos;Taegukgi&apos; and 1999&apos;s blockbuster &apos;Shiri,&apos; Director Kang Je-Gyu has signed an agreement with Hollywood&apos;s own powerhouse, CAA, to produce his next film in America. Only time will tell whether or not this agreement will afford some of the &apos;Korean sensibility&apos; to American films, but certainly having one of South Korea&apos;s premier directors breaking into the Hollywood film system is a tremendous advantage for fans of international film.\n\nOnly the passage of time will earn &apos;Taegukgi&apos; its rightful spot alongside the other great films dealing with the consequences of war.",

The acting is superb, and I guess the directing had a lot going for it too. Like the perfect storm,this just all came together and did a job of stirring me up good.\n\nThe tension built up from the start with Addison and what we learn about him and his coach. The relationship between the sheriff and his daughter, and the how the men treated her, and her stoic dealing with it...wow, I could not have handled it.\n\nThe relationship between the siblings was ambiguous but inspiring at the same time. The relationship in the family between the spouses and the son was written with such deft strokes which said so much. \n\nThe actors were fabulous. Especially at the dinner table at the climax of the story. The mother, Sissy Spacek, had such easy going wisdom about her but exploded with outraged indignation when pushed beyond the limit.\n\nLoved the way the brother got the &quot;L&quot; word out of the protagonist in the climactic denouement. And it left you in the end wondering how the story would go on with our antiheroes.\n\nOne of those screenplays where you just fall in love with the bad guy and it just kills you to know he is fated, and that he has written his own tragedy as well as having been written by it. \n\nLook forward to more of Zach Dean&apos;s screenplays."

      "reviewBody": "This film is a lot better than most would expect, largely because of two factors - the screenplay and the star.  The script, while not particularly original in terms of its narrative, is superb in terms of its humour which is quite dark and dry in parts.  &quot;There&apos;s a monster in my closet&quot; complains a frightened child.  Not after Payne puts five bullets into the closed door.\n\nPayne&apos;s unconventional character is a riot and the film is balanced just right so that he doesn&apos;t become too annoying.  And believe me, he has the potential to become very annoying, especially with THAT voice.  Wayans delivers his dialogue in a manner almost reminiscent TV&apos;s The Nanny - nasal and grating.  However, he performs with such dry sarcasm and a fantastic permanent grimace that he is a real stand-out, and ultimately the film probably wouldn&apos;t work as well with another actor in the role.\n\n For light entertainment value, 7/10 for Major Payne."

It&apos;s good to see a film that portrays a positive adult male image in film with children. The black and white cinematography makes the film timeless.

I love how I can identify each style of fighting and enjoyed the clarity of each strike, grab and throw. Too bad Keanu can&apos;t pull out his matrix-self and show us he still got it. \n\nI enjoyed this movie very much even with its flaws it is a solid kung fu movie. Kung fu movies are released fewer and fewer each year, and I hope Keanu can turn into a great kung-fu movie director and still continue his acting.",

      "name": "pleasant but time-marking comedy",
      "reviewBody": "Though essentially a time-marking throwaway by writer/director Woody Allen, `Small Time Crooks&apos; provides so many gems of performance that one can overlook the film&apos;s derivative plotting and overall lack of comic drive.  In this film, Allen more or less abandons his customary obsession with big city neuroses and middle-aged angst in favor of a more straightforward, plot-driven comedy, paying homage in its patchwork and eclectic story to any number of earlier well-known theatrical and cinematic works. \n\n For example, the first half hour of the movie plays like a stateside version of the 1950&apos;s Italian comedy `Big Deal on Madonna Street&apos; as a team of bumbling, far-from-intelligent small time crooks, led by ex-con Ray Winkler (Allen), sets up a cookie store as a `front&apos; so they can drill a tunnel into a bank a mere two or three shops down the road.  Then the plot of the film suddenly shifts gears when that plan falls apart and the gang hits pay dirt with the surprising success of the cookies that Ray&apos;s uncultured but well meaning wife, the former topless dancer Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), is assiduously baking and selling.  The highlight of the film comes in the form of a brilliantly satiric pseudo-60 Minutes report in which Steve Kroft himself chronicles the meteoric rise that this ragtag collection of accidental entrepreneurs takes from obscure small business owners to multi-million dollar corporate giants  a report that pokes affectionate fun at the clichéd rags-to-riches theme so essential to our concept of the beloved American Dream.   \n\nWith this plot switch, we leave Madonna Street and head into `Unsinkable Molly Brown/Pygmalion/Educating Rita&apos; territory as the vulgar, uncouth Frenchy realizes that, even with all her suddenly acquired wealth, she cannot possibly gain true acceptance from the elite cultural snobs she so desperately wants to impress without a little assistance from her own personal Henry Higgins, who arrives in the form of an art dealer named David played by the suave Hugh Grant.   Thus, as Frenchy branches out and begins to open herself up to new cultural experiences, the couple begins to drift apart as Ray comes to crave the return to the simpler life of spaghetti and meatball dinners he knows they have left far behind.\n\nHad Allen been able to sustain the cleverness and bite that inform that `60 Minutes&apos; segment throughout the length of the entire film, `Small Time Crooks&apos; might have emerged as more than just the mere piece of entertaining puffery it ultimately is.  Indeed, we find ourselves laughing only occasionally and often at jokes or sight gags that would barely register a chuckle in one of Allen&apos;s more sophisticated, more edgy and more character-driven works.  Special note must, however, be made of some of the actors, prime among them Ullman and the always brilliant Elaine May who, as Frenchy&apos;s adenoidal, utterly befuddled and endearingly obtuse cousin, returns to her `A New Leaf&apos; roots and provides some of the sweetest comic moments in the film.  Unfortunately, Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow and Jon Lovitz, as members of Ray&apos;s gang, though they all three give outstanding performances, aren&apos;t given enough screen time to really let their talents for comic characterization take flight.  Hugh Grant is essentially Hugh Grant  which is to say that he fulfills the requirements of his part without having to stretch his thespian muscles too much.\n\nThe success or failure of a comedy is ultimately determined by how often it is able to elicit laughs from the person watching it.  Given that criterion, `Small Time Crooks&apos; rates no better than a mild recommendation (though there is one very funny scene involving safecracking near the end of the film). Yet, if for no other reason than to relish a number of its dazzling performances, `Small Time Crooks&apos; certainly earns at least a casual once-over from any Allen devotee.  Guess we have no choice but to mark time right along with him!"

A desperate divorcée falls for a mysterious guy who, despite telegraphing to the audience how evil he secretly is, manages to fool his fiancée and her family into thinking that he&apos;s a swell guy....that is, until the body count starts. The plot isn&apos;t worth discussing. There&apos;s nothing here that we haven&apos;t seen before. What IS worth discussing is the director&apos;s obvious decision to exploit Amber Heard&apos;s lovely figure in one long never ending cheesecake sequence. You could make the argument that the ONLY reason this film was even made in the first place was to launch Amber into the stratosphere of blogworthy sex symbols (not unlike what Michael Bay managed to do with Megan Fox). You&apos;ll see Amber in her underwear lounging in bed, Amber in her itsy bitsy teeny weeny bikini, gratuitous close-ups of her splendid anatomy, etc. This exploitation becomes so flagrant that it distracts from the story itself, which is probably a good thing. In a way the Stepfather 2009 comes off more like a 70&apos;s Drive-In flick; the kind teenagers would flock to in hopes of seeing a little skin. Maybe that was the point after all? I sure hope it was. The movie certainly doesn&apos;t deliver much else.",

I mean its nothing more than average even know I thought it did have some originality. Any average horror/slasher fan would probably enjoy it, it&apos;s no worse than wolf creek or hostel. The film did a good job of setting their tones, they did a good job at pacing and they managed to do a good job with the intensity. The camera works a little frustrating at first but you get used to it and it ends up working for the film. The deaths and special effects aren&apos;t the most amazing at looking realistic but they did a good job with their budget. I also really liked how they developed the characters in this but they could use less gore, I mean I know thats whats getting the audience for some reason lately but it didn&apos;t feel necessary and they kept a gross scene on for just too long.\n\nOverall, Don&apos;t get me wrong this movie isn&apos;t excellent but its not as bad as everyones saying it is. If you liked wolf creek, hostel, into the blue, or the descent then you&apos;ll probably enjoy this, it&apos;s worth a look.",

It ain&apos;t so. While the title might be misleading (in quite a few ways), the characters in this aren&apos;t. You have finely structured people (with a cliché here and there), who seem to have their everyday problems and find a way to live with them.\n\nOur main character has quite a few struggles to go through this movie, some of them come &quot;back&quot; at him (no pun intended). And while quite a few things are more than cliché (the brother and what he does towards the end, is borderline believable, even with the setup through the movie), it has quite a few nice touches to it. All in all, a warm comedy, that goes more for the heart than the brain. A nice change of pace by Faith Akin and a movie, whose flaws shouldn&apos;t hinder you enjoying it.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was pretty cool.\n\nIt had all the stuff that a movie needs to be interesting; action, humor, love and thrills. And it all came together in a very good way to make for a superb movie experience.\n\nThe story was good and very easy to follow, straight forward, though there were no twists and odd turns of events, which could have made the movie a bit more interesting. But the movie was far from being boring, despite it having a rather one-simple-way plot line. The story was very likable and compelling.\n\nAs for the characters, well Bill Nighy was amazing as the lead role, portraying the somewhat eccentric hit-man Victor Maynard. There is something very charismatic about that man, and he was so well cast for this particular role. Moving on to Emily Blunt, in the role of Rose, well she did a good job as well, really bringing her on-the-edge character to life. However, Rupert Grint in the role of Tony, that was the bomb! He was such a blast in this movie, and it was fantastic to see him in a mature role, stepping out of the wizardly shoes of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; stuff. And it was really good to see the way the characters were given the time and effort to evolve throughout the movie, growing and making you relate to them. Few movies really get around this in a good way, but &quot;Wild Target&quot; managed to do that quite well.\n\nFor some reason this movie was more than just your average run of the mill action comedy. The way the characters were portrayed and how they came to life on the screen makes you really feel like you are right there in there with them. And that is really the strongest link of the movie.\n\nThere were some funny scenes and moments throughout the movie as well, though not the kind that will make you fall out of your seat with tears trickling down your cheeks. But the comedy in the movie is just subtle enough to be appropriate, without making the movie come off as trying too hard.\n\n&quot;Wild Target&quot; is a movie that you should watch, especially if you enjoy British movies. Thumbs way up for this movie.",

The strength of the film is the intelligence work that the characters do and that should have been the focus.\n\nThe acting was great. I particularly liked, Jason Isaacs as John Godfrey a naval commander and Simon Russel Beale as Winston Churchill.\n\nOverall, worth watching, especially if you normally like World War Two dramas or spy stories, but potentially could have been better I think.",

But when I went into the Cinema I wasn&apos;t expecting anything mind-blowing, in fact I wasn&apos;t expecting anything at all. Surprisingly I didn&apos;t seam to find the movie overly predictable, however at times its dramatically far fetched. Notably the complete stupidity of a shooting occurring in broad day light in a busy European city going unnoticed. All this being said, the movie is entertaining. I wasn&apos;t at any moment particularly board with its rather slow beginning moving on to a fast paces final hour. Surprisingly Ewan McGregor seamed to portray the role fairly well with the exception of a few noticeable accent slips. Michelle Williams on the other hand has much to be desired. In no way am I suggesting she&apos;s a great actress but I was surprised at how unconvincingly she portrays a rather simple role. Its definitely a mixed bag, where on one hand its very engaging and on the other it has obvious flaws. I recommend it, you&apos;ll be thoroughly entertained but try not going in the theatre expecting to much.",

In the Q&amp;A after the film, Bobcat pointed out that most of the comedies being made these days are basically R-rated films made for 13-year-olds (mindless, raunchy, etc.). World&apos;s Greatest Dad is a comedy for adults: insightful, original, uncomfortable at times...hilarious. Robin Williams manages to be miserable, mean, touching, and funny without any conflict at all, an inspired break from his traditional roles.",

      "reviewBody": "You can get a pretty good idea of Southland Tales from a quick description of its characters. Dwayne Johnson plays Boxer Santaros, a movie star in Richard Kelly&apos;s all-too-near dystopian future. But it&apos;s not that straightforward. Johnson plays The Rock playing Boxer Santaros, while Boxer is playing the role of a character he&apos;s researching, one Jericho Kane. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays an ageing porn-star with a business portfolio that includes energy drinks. And Sean William Scott? Well, he plays a cop&apos;s amnesiac twin brother, as part of a neo-Marxist scheme to overthrow the government. Or does he? And you thought Donnie Darko was confusing. Welcome to Southland...\n\nThe year is 2008. Justin Timberlake - did I forget to mention him? He plays a drugged-up Iraq war veteran with a huge scar on his face. Who sits in a huge chair with a huge rifle, guarding &quot;Fluid Karma&quot;, an ultra-valuable perpetual motion wave machine that is the new form of power since oil has become rare and therefore massively expensive. Politics, anyone? Anyway, JT (who might be telepathic) narrates over an introduction comprised of graphic novel slides and MTV-meets-FOX news bulletins that guides us from our present to the &quot;present&quot; of Kelly&apos;s 2008 Southland. The passage of time has not been kind to the US; a nuke has gone off in Texas, and the country has become a police state. The most &quot;recent&quot; clip reveals that Boxer (played by Dwayne Johnson playing The Rock) has disappeared without a trace, which is where the movie begins. Or does it? By this stage, you just might have gotten the impression that Southland Tales is a bit of a mess. And you&apos;d be right. Kelly&apos;s attempt at a politically-charged all-encompassing comment on the world that can also appeal to the youth of today does ultimately fall flat, but that&apos;s not to say it&apos;s without its merits. The satire&apos;s often sharp, and the way the movie skips from genre-to-genre (dystopian conspiracy to Scooby Doo farce to musical to action movie) works surprisingly well without jarring too much. The music, while not perfect (I&apos;m pretty sure Black Rebel Motorcycle Club won&apos;t have the kind of comeback that allows them to host LA&apos;s 4th of July weekend party next year...) creates some of the movie&apos;s more memorable moments, such as JT&apos;s Killers dance number and the captivating three-way dance toward the end.\n\nThe deliberately exaggerated performances are, for the most part, very good, with Johnson capturing the action man (playing an action man - going through a crisis - playing an action man) role very well. The way he switches from the kind of guy who pours beer over himself as a form of refreshment to jittery neurotic mess is both funny and engaging, allowing you to see a little of the man beneath the steely facade.\n\nUnfortunately, this is as close as you&apos;ll get to the characters. While the overplaying is amusing, it excludes you on an emotional level. Donnie Darko worked so well because it drew you in, but Southland seems to deliberately keep you at arm&apos;s length lest you miss out on some of Kelly&apos;s political messages. For all its mystery, intrigue, and action, it feels a bit soulless, and goes out with a whimper as opposed to the bang it so desires.\n\nSouthland Tales is an ambitious film, but a messy one, and while it may not work on the kind of level it&apos;s aspiring to, in a movie climate where so many films play it safe, at least Kelly tries. Very flawed, but entertaining nonetheless.",

It is a well acted love story the end of which is not signaled as some other argued!It is not a cliché at all.If someone claim otherwise, i would like him/her give me an example similar to this movie in plot. \n\nI would recommend this movie to everyone for a nice evening!

But I have to admit that this movie wasn&apos;t even the worst in the genre. Yes from time to time it can even be quite enjoyable. However, there&apos;s already a huge list of this kind of movies and &quot;Bulletproof&quot; certainly isn&apos;t the best of them either. \n\nDamon Wayans is an undercover cop who works with an unsuspecting criminal, played by Adam Sandler, to catch the big boss of a drug cartel. What happens next is a mix of a lot of action and some fun parts. The action sequences are nice to watch, but not every joke in this movie works very well. Still, in the end it isn&apos;t too bad, but like many action comedies, this one is very predictable and sometimes also very much over-the-top. \n\nI guess this movie will be loved most by the people who like the genre or by the great fans of Sandler&apos;s work. Since I don&apos;t belong to any of these two groups, I give it only a 5.5/10.",

Everyone involved tried their best, but it is clear that Netflix left them with two hours instead of the necessary 12 to finish the story properly. The relationship between two step brothers eying the throne. How Aethalstan just becomes a tyrant. How his father even died? And the gay advisor? WHY?\n\nIt amazes me how deft these corporations are. You have a beloved series and you just let it fall to pieces. I mean look at GOT. They should have fired D&amp;D and gotten new showrunners. In this case it is obvious Netflix just decided on a movie rather than pay the talented creators, actors, writers, and everyoneone else involved, probably to make another horrible anime live action, or the crap witcher prequel.\n\nShould take a note from Vince Gilliam and let it go till he see&apos;s it fit to end.\n\nI thank everyone involved for 5 seasons of the best historically based fantasy I&apos;ve seen.\n\nDestiny is all, and hopefully Netflix will feel that fire one day.",

This was the first movie that really punched my ego and played my emotions. Some parts of the movie can rip your soul and enlighten you about the divinity of God, the nature of life, the circumstances that we do not understand. The story was beautifully and intricately written, absolutely.\n\nIf you watch the movie, you will really feel that God was there, in front of you, talking to you, loving you, giving you ideas that encompass human comprehension.\n\n&quot;Why does it have to happen?, why do we have to suffer?, If God does exist, why wont he show then?&quot;, these are questions common to us, surely you have asked these questions yourself.\n\nIf you are that person who questions the incomprehensible course of fate, circumstance and life, this movie is for you."

Another reason perhaps is the adventurous style of the film, but it is acceptable because father Merrin is younger than in the original film. The best actor to portray a young father Merrin is certainly the wonderful Stellan Skarsgård, what a stylish performance, this superb actor gives such a perfect image of how the main character would have been at the moment in his life when he lost his faith. The two other most important roles by Izabella Scorupco and James D&apos;Arcy are excellent, the best supporting role is performed by Alan Ford. The madness and the confusion in the final battle between the Turkana and the Brithish are convincingly brought to screen. As for the crew members, I was very impressed by Trevor Rabin his soundtrack, the production design of Stefano Maria Ortolani and the magnificent cinematography by Vittorio Storaro. Conclusion: if you watch this film objectively than you will probably enjoy it. All though sometimes over the top, Renny Harlin has made a good prequel to the original one, with some very memorable scenes.",

It&apos;s a total disaster. The editing is really bad, it seems like I&apos;ve literally seen a dubbed movie, dubbing is really bad.\n\nFirst half of the movie is really irrational and disgusting, screenplay is lengthy for this pathetic script. It seems like they have written this movie in a one drunk night out. Music of this movie is also bad, they have just wasted money on this kind of music. Background score is good but it was not meant for this movie.\n\nJust watch it once, if you are only watching for Salman Khan. Believe me it&apos;s the bad movie of Salman Khan throughout his entire career.\n\nRating 4/10, only for some side role actors.",

      "reviewBody": "Aside from being a thoroughly enjoyable film, &quot;Tangerine&quot; has the remarkable distinction of being shot entirely on an iPhone 5S. How such a feat was accomplished is beyond me for while it does appear to be a low budget piece it looks fantastic. Furthermore, maybe because of the unique film techniques, it feels very real, like you were just tagging along for the duration.\n\nThe story takes place over the course of about 12 hours, following the lives of two transgender prostitutes on Christmas Eve. Sin-dee has just been released from jail, and her best friend Alexandra lets slip that her boyfriend/pimp picked up with another women while she was away. This sets Sin-dee off on a rampage as she scours the L.A. streets looking for the new girl and her cheating man. The story weaves from Sin-dee&apos;s quest, to Alexandra picking up a few tricks throughout the day, and subtly follows a cab driver who has a thing for Sin-dee, while his family works out his proclivities. Through all of this, the film is not condescending, preachy, or insensitive to anyone. It is brutally honest, hilarious at times, realistic, even touching and sad.\n\nI loved this movie. From the colorful characters to the perfect pacing to the creative cinematography, &quot;Tangerine&quot; is one film every lover of cinema should watch at least once. Oh, and a super soundtrack! I hope to add it to the collection one day.",

Praise is given to the cinematography, production design, and Pierre Niney's portrayal of Edmond Dantès. However, the script faces criticism for altering key plot points, characters, and the novel's ending, which many feel reduces the story's depth and emotional impact. Some appreciate the modernization and streamlined narrative, while others miss the novel's complexity and moral dilemmas.",

The prison seemed too romanticised to me, as did the society. The Count could hardly stand out from the others due to his wealth and mystique, because this didn&apos;t always come to the surface.\n\nNevertheless, the film is entertaining and I was never bored. It managed to tell the whole story, although in a different way. Unfortunately, I couldn&apos;t answer the question of why this film was made, because it&apos;s just another version.\n\nWatch the film if you don&apos;t know the story yet and like a romanticised story.

      "reviewBody": "Who needs expensive movie stars when a group of unknowns can light up the screen like this lot?\n\nOn paper, it sounds like a failure - a cast comprising almost entirely of untrained and untested performers, set in working class Dublin, based on the novella by Roddy Doyle.  By God, does it defy expectations.\n\nJimmy Rabbitte is a working class Dublin lad who&apos;s been collecting unemployment benefits for two years.  But he dreams of bigger things, namely making it big in the music industry.  He sets out to form a soul band, and assembles a motley crew of musicians and singers, most of whom don&apos;t know each other and many of whom can&apos;t stand each other.\n\nThe look of the film is gritty and realistic - nothing is glossed over. North Dublin is presented in all it&apos;s glory.  The home lives of the band members are depicted warts and all - their private lives set the scene for the inevitable personality clashes that are almost as explosive as the music.  In the mix is the unique character of the Irish people - at one point Jimmy enters a tenement block and, as he waits for the lift, looks over to see a boy with a horse.  &quot;You aren&apos;t taking that in the lift, are you?&quot; he asks.  &quot;I have to,&quot; the boy replies.  &quot;The stairs would kill him.&quot;\n\nThe real star of the show is the music - this film spawned two hugely successful soundtrack albums.  The band members were cast partly due to their musical ability, and the results are superlative.  The stand out is Andrew Strong as Deco - would you believe this kid was only 16 when the film was made?  His amazing voice belies his tender years, and suggests that he&apos;s been smoking a packet a day since the age of about four.  At the end of the day with is a fine ensemble piece, much like the band.  The acting may be a little wonky at times, but the hysterical dialogue makes up for that.\n\nMost remarkably, this is a feel good film that does not rely on any of the conventional feel good plot devices.  There are no group hugs, no plot conveniences, no trite happy endings.  Just a shrewdly observed and wittily captured human story about people who dream of making it out of their dreary world.  And isn&apos;t that something we can all relate to?",

I watched it for Julia Roberts and Jennifer Aniston, but I was rather disappointed by it. These ensemble comedies have so many subplots and so many characters, that none of them are fully developed. As a result, I don&apos;t really know the characters well enough to care for any of them.\n\nthe Kate Hudson subplot is funny and entertaining enough, providing the comic relief. The Julia Roberts subplot is very disappointing, because it could have been so much better. She could have made a touching announcement on TV, which would have a far greater impact on the viewers. Instead, something else happened on TV which I don&apos;t care for at all.\n\n&quot;Mother&apos;s Day&quot; had so much potential, but wasted the concept and the talent involved."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;And binding with briars my joys and desires.&quot; William Blake, from Songs of Experience\n\nLiberal Arts is a small, endearing film about idealism, the reality of life, the complicated nature of aging, and the beauty of experience. The briars play a part, but mostly it&apos;s about the romanticism of academia versus the reality of growing old. That&apos;s quite a bit for 97 minutes, but writer/director Josh Radnor does an admirable job setting straight the hopes that a superior education like his at Kenyon College can foster.\n\nThis lyrical film, like the simple poem that opens this review, makes no grand demands as it juxtaposes the beauty of undergraduate reading and writing with the reality of love not quite mature enough and maturity not ready enough. New York City college admissions counselor Jesse (Josh Radnor) at 35 returns to his college to visit a retiring professor, Peter (Richard Jenkins), and falls for a 19 year old coed, Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen). Radnor&apos;s alma mater, Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, is the beautiful location although not identified.\n\nThe complications may be obvious given the differences in their ages, but the issues are spot on—and because I lived that plot as a youngish college administrator I congratulate Radnor for neither over-romanticizing nor condemning youthful idealism and the encroachments of &quot;life,&quot; described as &quot;happening&quot; after graduation and mitigating the romanticism a college English major fosters. That the pop cult ascendance of the Vampire Trilogy may trump the lofty literature of college does not subvert the notion that everything is good given the right place and time. \n\nThe sweetness of the film reaffirms Mr. Radnor as a dreamer of quality, a thinker who confirms life&apos;s ambiguities and its promise to those who &quot;say yes&quot; to everything. Again, Blake in Songs of Innocence confirms the efficacy of positive thinking, in this case of feeling the godhead&apos;s presence:\n\nHe doth give his joy to all;/ He becomes an infant small;/ He becomes a man of woe; / He doth feel the sorrow too.\n\n&quot;It&apos;s not Tolstoy, but it&apos;s not television, and it makes me happy,&quot; Zibby says about reading a vampire trilogy. The same could be said of this simple romance underpinned by Blake&apos;s realistic optimism."

Every frame feels meticulously crafted, elevating Indian mythological storytelling to international standards. But what really sets the film apart is its presentation - the buildup, the intensity, and the raw power of Narsimha Avataar gives you literal goosebumps. The transformation scenes, in particular, are awe-inspiring.\n\nThe music is deeply moving and perfectly aligned with the narrative. It amplifies every emotion - from the innocence and devotion of Prahlad to the fierce justice delivered by Narsimha. And while many of us know the story, the way it&apos;s told here makes it feel fresh and relevant. The film doesn&apos;t just narrate - it makes you feel the divine presence.\n\nThis isn&apos;t just a movie for kids or mythology enthusiasts - it&apos;s for anyone who appreciates strong storytelling, rich visuals, and deeply rooted cultural emotion. Mahavtara Narsimha raises the bar for Indian animation and leaves a lasting impression on the soul.",

      "reviewBody": "At a pre-screening and Q&amp;A with Director Michael Lehmann and writer Karen Leigh Hopkins hosted by critic Leonard Maltin, the soon to be released film opened with mixed reactions before the 365 member audience of USC film students. The narrative gets off to a slow start with on opening sequence that fails to arouse much interest or laughter. Only until a joke is shared between Millie (Moore) and her mother (Keaton) about a man&apos;s uncircumcised entity does the audience begin laughing. This is fairly representative of the movie&apos;s humor. It is consistently funny, but only through cheap and superficial jokes and scenarios. At times it even verges on slapstick. However, credit must be given to both Moore and Keaton who put out stellar performances. Moore proves her ability to be an actress following initial debut in Saved and will hopefully be able to move past her image as teenie-bopper musician. Keaton convincingly portrays an over the top single mother who cannot keep her nose out of her daughters&apos; business. The film will have wide appeal for female audiences as it is about the mother-daughter relationship. But men will also find humor throughout and should not be discouraged to accompany their wives and girlfriends. (Note: Guys, this is a good chance to compromise on seeing a romantic comedy that will not bore or disgust.) The film sticks to genre conventions but the comedy aspect of the film veers from typical. The set design and editing are both noteworthy. The film will provide a fun evening for couples, old and young, at the theater and home.",

An overall average movie, nothing mind blowing, but also not impossible to watch.\n\nThe movie is a little cliché at points and most of it you have seen before in whatever romantic comedy you decide to think of, but there are a few additions to this movie that made it enjoyable for me.\n\nAs a huge fan of the TV show &quot;The Office&quot;, I went to the theater the other night hoping that the movie would keep me as entertained as the small screen gem does. If this is what you are hoping for, sorry, its a bit of a let down. However, the simple appearance of a couple of &quot;Office&quot; stars is enjoyable.\n\nThe only real beef that I have with the movie overall is Robin Williams&apos; sexed up priest character. I can understand what they were trying to do (humor from sex dialogue), but the conversations seemed uncomfortable to me. A priest becoming sexual isn&apos;t that far fetched in this day and age, but really, when your movie makes it look like a priest is hitting on a woman in his marriage counseling class in front of her soon to be husband, just rubs me the wrong way.\n\nLicense to Wed is neither terrible nor wonderful. My recommendation would be to watch it if you really don&apos;t care what you watch and just need a popcorn movie to relax. No huge laughs but no huge let downs either.",

And as I said in my review of The Blair Witch Project, you need an open mind watching this film.  Book Of Shadows shows you the blood and gore that wasn&apos;t needed in the first film, which is either a plus or minus--depending on your taste. I thought it was interesting and entertaining.

Of whatever action there is, its because of two lovers trying to be together and not a spy trying to steal valuable information or anything. Its very well put together, and Katrina has acted well, loved her in this role and she looks like a charm considering she didn&apos;t use any makeup for this one. I went with 4 other guys, all of them were disappointed, I wasn&apos;t, I cant say its good, nor can say its bad, its a bit above average, hence 6.If the trailer showed Salman holding hands with katrina showing her the stars rather than him shooting people, and the intro line was something like &quot;Two lovers.......&quot; rather than &quot;RAW and ISI.............&quot;, than people wouldn&apos;t have expected so much love/romance and wouldn&apos;t be disappointed. People found it slow since love/romance is slow, and a few would also have a problem seeing Salman in a much lighter shade as compared to boastful/salman focused movies like Dabangg/ready/bodyguard. Its definitely a one time watch, if its playing on TV, i&apos;ll watch it, not change the channel, it does strike a chord.",

      "reviewBody": "Brilliant scientist Dr. Lawrence Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) uses simple-minded gardener Jobe (Jeff Fahey) as a guinea pig in his virtual reality experiments, using mind altering drugs and immersive computer technology to enhance his subject&apos;s intelligence and awaken parts of the brain that have lain dormant for centuries. As Jobe becomes smarter and smarter, the evil corporation behind Angelo&apos;s funding pull a switcheroo on the drugs, making the gardener more aggressive. Eventually, Jobe attempts to leave the physical realm to inhabit the worldwide computer network, where he would be a technological god.\n\nSo dissimilar is this film to Stephen King&apos;s original short story, that the author successfully sued the company that made it. Despite this, The Lawnmower Man still feels very much like a King product, especially with its dysfunctional characters, small-town setting, and occasional religious overtones. Since I deem anything King-related to be worth a watch, no matter how slight the connection, I had a reasonably good time with the film, although there no denying that its once cutting-edge visuals now look horribly dated, and render the film less effective overall (it&apos;s hard to be impressed by graphics that most of today&apos;s kids could do better on their laptop).\n\nWatch to see a cyberchimp firing a pistol, Fahey transforming from a simpleton to super buff stud-muffin, an abusive father being chased by a big red lawnmower, Jenny Wright as a rich floozy, and a pre-Bond Brosnan with floppy hair pulling Semtex out of thin air. Don&apos;t watch expecting to be wowed by incredible special effects (the burning of a sadistic priest ranks amongst the worst CGI that I have ever seen).",

It was perfect, from start to finish, and I can&apos;t believe I didn&apos;t hear more about it. Sadly, a lot of good horrors lately remain completely unknown even after they are release and it is quite the shame, but fanatics will always find a way of digging them up. \n\nThe cast was good, Mark Webber did an excellent job, Ron Perlman is always good on screen and Pruitt Taylor Vince always offers a dark touch to his films. The plot was not the most original, but not one of those over used subjects either, the execution is the key here. Pretty much everything was done the way it supposed to and all horror fans will have a big smile at the end of it. 13 sins is indeed a good horror!\n\nI will end this by saying: YOU need to watch it!",

His dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded. It helps the play come to life on screen, and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching, as we did while studying it, to follow and analyze the text.\n\nOne of the things I have heard criticized many times is the casting of major Hollywood names in the play. I find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier, as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with Shakespeare.\n\nAlso, his flashbacks help to clear up many ambiguities in the text. Such as how far the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia really went and why Fortinbras just happened to be at the castle at the end. All in all, not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with Shakespeare. It is presented in a way that one does not have to be an English Literature Ph.D to understand and enjoy it.",

Which is a pity, since more people would enjoy the film if their expectations were different. They go in thinking the film is one way. When in reality, it&apos;s a whole other thing. The film is much more touching, funny, and real. I cared about the two main characters, and how they interacted. I was interested in what was at stake for them. For me, the smaller moments of the film made it enjoyable. It was delightful to see Streisand and Rogen working off each other like they have known each other for years. Be sure to stay for the credits to see just how well they played off each other.",

It delves into corporate greed, racism, and justice, highlighting their friendship. Critics commend the engaging narrative and compelling legal battle portrayal. However, some are disappointed with the courtroom procedures and the omission of Hal Dockins, played by Mamoudou Athie, who is crucial but not acknowledged. The film entertains with drama, comedy, and social commentary, though it receives mixed reviews for realism and predictability.",

While times may have changed, the relentless pursuit of accumulating wealth persists. In the contemporary landscape, these greedy individuals often lurk behind the scenes, orchestrating their actions through the guise of a corporate entity.\n\nThe narrative unfolds like a cinematic tale, depicting the struggle of a small businessman against the machinations of a powerful corporation. The film delves into the company&apos;s attempt to undermine the entrepreneur, aiming to acquire his business at a fraction of its worth and subsequently turning that investment into substantial millions. The pursuit of wealth becomes so consuming that these corporate leaders lose touch with the very basics of life, such as the cost of their own sustenance.\n\nTommy Lee Jones and Jamie Foxx deliver exceptional performances, bringing sheer class to their roles in this compelling courtroom drama-a definite must-watch.",

      "reviewBody": "New Jack City is directed by Mario Van Peebles (who also co-stars) and written by Thomas Lee Wright and Barry Michael Cooper. It stars Wesley Snipes, Ice-T, Judd Nelson, Allen Payne, Chris Rock, Bill Nunn, Bill Cobbs and Michael Michele. Music is by Vassal Benford and Michael Colombier and cinematography by Francis Kenny. \n\nNew York City, 1986 and crack cocaine is the drug of choice and Nino Brown (Snipes) and his gang, the Cash Money Brothers, are building a violent empire and cornering the market. Enter streetwise cop Scotty Appleton (Ice-T) and loose cannon Nick Peretti (Nelson), who form an uneasy partnership willing to push the law&apos;s boundaries to bring Nino down \n\nThe Black Scarface! \n\nOn narrative terms it&apos;s basically an urban modernisation of the Scarface story, the themes at work were nothing new back then, never mind in cinema post 1991. That it is predominantly an African American film caused many at the time to call it a Blaxploitation picture for the 90s set, which is unfair, because it has more on offer than that and doesn&apos;t shy away from the dramatics available with such a story. True, it isn&apos;t pulling up any trees or breaking new ground in the drug/crime order of cinema, but it&apos;s incendiary enough to be thrilling whilst never romanticising the lifestyle of the drug gang. It paints a stark world of a drug infested city populated by colourful gang members, hapless addicts and edgy coppers, all sound tracked by pulse pounding hip-hop beats. \n\nThis was Van Peebles&apos; first big screen directing outing and it&apos;s a hugely impressive debut. So much so it begs the question on why his subsequent directing career has been something of a none event? Here he delves deep into the realm of neo-noir to provide the picture with many visual smarts and techniques. Backgrounds are often showing oblique angles, colour schemes such as garish greens feature in striking compositions, a flashing red light is used adroitly on a character&apos;s face as he struggles to hold his rage, a POV shot of a basketball and the opening of the film with a slow zoom in on a crime about to be committed on a bridge, these are just some of the flair tricks showcased by Peebles. \n\nWhile some of the key characters that form Nino&apos;s gang are under developed, Peebles does garner a great performance out of Snipes and very good turns from Ice-T and Nelson. Snipes provides Brown with a sinister swagger, yet a charm exudes from him that makes it believable that people would be willing to be led by him. Ice and Nelson are a cool double act, both Scotty and Nick pulse with machismo but are equally flawed as characters. The other important character and performance is Pookie played by Rock, a reformed crack addict now helping the police. Peebles is unsubtle in his handling of the Pookie situation, but it strikes the requisite emotional chord and puts further dramatic worth into an already tense filled thriller. \n\nIt&apos;s not as revolutionary as was once heralded, there is some formula familiarity and the finale is telegraphed too easily, but this has energy and style to burn. Making it one of the leading lights of the drug crime sub-genre of neo-noir. It&apos;s a damn shame Peebles was never this good again. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "After the emotional kick in the gut with Precious, one may go into The Paperboy anticipating something of a roller coaster ride from Lee Daniels and the talented cast, but The Paperboy isn&apos;t Precious by any means. The quality of the film itself is so crummy, it&apos;s a wonder this high profile cast was attracted to it. Through all the cheesy and trashy aspects of the film, The Paperboy at least pushes the boundaries of what we expect and creates some shocking scenes in its plot.\n\nThe screenplay does have a fairly intriguing plot, it&apos;s bites off a lot of issues to talk about, but never fully realizes any of them. Sometimes the &quot;issues&quot; are so thin, they slide right by the viewer. The most fun for the viewer is to watch the interaction between Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman&apos;s characters. It&apos;s an usual romantic relationship. Everything unusual is what The Paperboy has going for its screenplay. The script does develop the characters fairly well, some of the characters more than others.\n\nThe acting is the saving grace of The Paperboy and is what makes it watchable. Though John Cusack doesn&apos;t convince us in his juicy role, the rest of the cast is good. Zac Efron is decent in his protagonist role, Matthew McConaughey does fairly good work, but the true star is Nicole Kidman. It&apos;s a role that requires a lot of courage. The actress who had to play Charlotte would had to embarrass herself completely; Kidman owns that and brings the character out through those humiliating moments. \n\nLee Daniels is the man who screwed the project up. It was never destined to be a groundbreaking film, but Daniels holds it back from being at least decent as a movie. It becomes campy, has stereotypical racism, and messy scenes drowning in disarray. The narrative isn&apos;t strong enough to overcome Daniels&apos;s misdirection, even with the cast trying their best. \n\nRating: 4/10\n\nGrade: C"

The kind that lasts an impression and is thought of every time &quot;William Hurt&quot; is pronounced out loud. The film, in a nutshell could be summed up as a man&apos;s obsessive quest for the &quot;truth&quot;. Truth about life, and the universe, why we&apos;re here, who created us? These are the core questions Ken Russel - more fairly, the original author Paddy Chayefsky - asks. All of that, is assisted by insane hallucinatory and downright horrifying visual sequences and music, which when combined, literally gave me goosebumps when I saw it all on screen. They take you on a surreal &apos;trip&apos; and are a way for the viewer to experience what Hurt&apos;s character undergoes when he is in the isolation chamber. On another note, the pacing is a little slow in the first act, but sudden outbursts of surreal visual sequences get you back up in form.\n\nIf you&apos;re a thinker, this one&apos;s for you.",

      "name": "Sean Baker is the reigning king of unearthing true modern Americana",
      "reviewBody": "In an industry that loves to tell stories of how America used to be or how it wants to see itself currently, Baker bravely holds up the mirror of reality to a denial driven medium. He can do this without reproach because the sincerity and truthfulness of his characters resonate so deeply as to make them unassailable. In each of his films we see characters shoved to the margins of the masses, but as his body of work grows we realize these people are not so ancillary but instead, quilted together, make up the mosaic of our true identity.\n\nHis latest subject is Mikey Saber, played exquisitely by Simon Rex, a former porn star returned to his long forgotten small town of Texas City. Mikey is affable enough but also shamelessly self-serving and utterly incapable of feeling any personal responsibility. We learn in the first 10 minutes of the film that our &quot;hero&quot; is in fact our villain, but we are given no respite from following him through his deceits for the entirety of the runtime. There are no moments of saving grace or deeper understanding of his character. Because he never aims to understand himself. He lies and embellishes his accomplishments, yet there is a weird earnestness to the proceedings. He is narcissistic but not intentionally malicious. There seem to be no ends to his means outside of self-preservation and a padding of his irreparably broken ego. His lies he tells, how quickly he is to interject his modest celebrity, and his propensity for deflecting all blame, all serve only his own fragility.\n\nIt&apos;s a singular character study and this is all without mentioning a single other character, several of which could carry their own film. Most notable is the nearly 18 year old girl, Strawberry, who is the aim of the nearly 50 year old, Mikey&apos;s, affection. She represents that awkward cross-section many young women exist in between maturity and naiveté. She is smarter, brighter, deeper, and certainly better than Mikey and, yet, considerably less wise. You unfortunately can&apos;t fake wisdom, you simply have to earn it. She falls prey to his promises and will likely be the next victim of his uncalculated chaos.\n\nThe movie has so much insight to offer while also being outlandishly funny. All of this has not even scratched the surface of the psychology of this movie. From the subtle but very intentional political commentary, to the examination of what &quot;physical endowments&quot; can have on the masculine psyche and confidence, this movie is deceptively weighty, while also being a trashy good time.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Fools Rush In&apos; is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Though, I know that many will dislike it but I&apos;d take it anyday over any Julia Roberts rom-com. It&apos;s sweet without having too much sugar. It&apos;s one I have repeatedly watched and never got bored of. Director Andy Tenant deserves credit for putting it all together.\n\nIt has the unusual pairing of Matthew Perry and Salma Hayek (which really works). Both share a great chemistry and look good together. While Perry&apos;s Alex is a little similar to Chandler Bing (except with a much bigger problem to deal with), the actor knows how to make the audience like him. Hayek as the vibrant, stubborn, mean but adorable Isabel is simply brilliant. The rest of the cast provide adequate support.\n\nThe movie is full of light and delightful moments. Though there are certain aspects of culture clash, it is all presented in a humorous manner. Supporting the movie is a wonderful soundtrack, some fine location shots and the funny screenplay itself (which is predictable but doesn&apos;t spoil the fun on the way)."

However, the premise is as old as they get: boy finds girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl again, and they all live happily ever after. Of course, I&apos;m not giving anything away here because the movie is not about the humans; it&apos;s about the dogs and one bird. And you can&apos;t leave out the bird. The bird is the real star of the movie. His name is Waddlesworth, and he is a MacCaw that does more than just talk -- he converses. The voice is that of Eric Idle (of Monty Python fame). Waddlesworth thinks he&apos;s a dog and cannot fly and is the comic relief for the movie, adding asides for our enjoyment.\n\n This film is better than 101 Dalmatians, which in its own right was very good, and both children and adults will enjoy it. It is pure entertainment. My teenager and six-year-old both liked it and said Waddlesworth was their favorite character. This is typical Disney entertainment: Wholesome with just enough adult humor for mom and dad, excitement for the teenagers, and tenderness for the younger ones. Besides, who doesn&apos;t like a little puppy? This movie has 102 of them!",

      "reviewBody": "I agree with the other comments on the following points: the film does indeed concentrate on the culprits and their actions in a documentary way (as opposed to an interpretation of the RAF&apos;s ideas and motivations from a clear-cut political standpoint). Although the victims DO appear they are not characterized more closely; the only representative of the state is Horst Herold (head of the BKA), politicians do not show up at all, the media appear only in the shape of Springer, konkret and Spiegel and even the lawyers (Haag, Croissant, Schily, Ströbele, etc.) are merged into only one (fictitious?) character. I for one do agree with this approach and if you are prepared for it you probably can live with it too. In any case, despite all the chases, shootouts and explosions it hasn&apos;t become a mere action-film. \n\nWhat&apos;s more problematic is that the film follows the book by Stefan Aust VERY closely. Therefore the dramaturgy is more similar to &quot;real life&quot; than to a classical feature film (e.g. there are many changes in pace, several climaxes are distributed over the course of the film and a proper arc of suspense is somewhat missing). &quot;Fortunately&quot; real life offered a culmination of events with the Schleyer kidnapping in the &quot;German Autumn&quot; 1977, so that the film ends in a reasonably satisfying way. Nevertheless the end credits come a little abruptly.\n\nThe second problem is that the film tries to show virtually ALL events from the book (only some minor incidents like the Mahler detention, Peter Urbach, the burglaries in registration offices in order to steal blank passports or the visit of Jean-Paul Sartre in Stammheim are missing) so that it needs to squeeze 10 years of history into 140 minutes. The result is a film with breakneck speed at some points. The better scenes (e.g. the training camp in Jordan or the lawsuit in Stammheim) are obviously those where the film catches breath, calms down and takes its time for the actors to shine.\n\nThe quality of the acting ranges from good to fantastic (with very few exceptions like Alexandra Maria Lara, who is nothing more than wide-eyed again and who thankfully doesn&apos;t even have dialogue). Especially Martina Gedeck and Johanna Wokalek are sensational. It is THEIR film and the conflicts in Stammheim which led to Meinhof&apos;s suicide are acted Oscar-worthy. But Michael Gwisdek (Ensslin&apos;s father), Jan Josef Liefers (Peter Homann), Sebastian Blomberg (Rudi Dutschke), Nadja Uhl (Brigitte Mohnhaupt) and Hannah Herzsprung (Susanne Albrecht) are also very good.\n\nThe production values are excellent too. A lot of locations, a great deal of main and supporting roles, hundreds of extras, good special effects (mainly explosions) and a set design and costume design which creates a very coherent 70&apos;s atmosphere: you can see that the film cost a lot of money. Every cent is on the screen.\n\nI didn&apos;t like the choice of music that much. Deep Purple&apos;s &quot;Child in Time&quot; is always great to hear, but the rest (Janis Joplin, The Who, Bob Dylan) is just too mainstreamy and unimaginative for my taste (but probably also very expensive). Why not use MC5, Ton Steine Scherben or Ennio Morricone&apos;s &quot;Vamos a matar, companeros&quot;?\n\nNow I&apos;m looking forward to the reactions and reviews from other countries, who probably don&apos;t know this part of German history very well. In the US I expect the criticism that there are too many naked people, too many swear words and even more cigarettes (every one in BMK smokes everywhere and at all times), in order to distract from the politics of the film ;-) &quot;Der Baader Meinhof Komplex&quot; isn&apos;t the masterpiece on the history of the first generation of the RAF that I had hoped for in my comments on &quot;Todesspiel&quot;, but altogether it is a very suspenseful, fascinating, densely narrated and well acted film. Hopefully it will not be the last word on the subject, but it succeeds in giving the audience the basic RAF knowledge on which future (less neutral, more opinionated) movies can build their stories.",

      "reviewBody": "Okay, one can expect exactly that with a Sanjay Leela Bhansali. The man sure knows his stuff when it comes to photography and even when something is lacking in the storytelling department, this remains an almost inconsequential detail by the end of the show. This was true for previous Bhansali productions, including Devdas, which was actually a good film in and of itself, while my personal favourite in this regard is probably Saawariya, which was so overwhelmingly stunning I could watch it anytime just for how beautiful it is to look at. Bajirao Mastani is an epic romance, and it definitely works in both story and execution, but it&apos;s not a tremendous show as it never really manages to tug at the heartstrings despite its strong story. I wish I could allow myself to get more involved in the story and feel more for the characters and their travails, but it didn&apos;t really happen, also probably due to the fact that it&apos;s an epic, distant and larger-than-life style of execution, but more because it lacked some depth here and there.\n\nBut again, the visuals, oh the visuals - Bhansali is a true craftsman in this regard, and no one can take it from him. The amazing setting, the props, cinematography, the lighting, the extraordinary, impeccable attention to detail, the symmetry, make for a visual treat the kind of which you rarely see. What about the film itself, you ask? Well, it&apos;s interesting and captivating, and the music is phenomenal as well. The three leads are really good, particularly Chopra who gets the meatiest part of a woman driven by jealousy, ego, in spite of which she finds room in her heart for compassion and forgiveness. Deepika is stunning, and Ranveer Singh is a good lead whose every expression is clearly carefully thought out before. It also has a phenomenal Tanvi Azmi whose every turn over the past decade has been impressive. At the end of the day, Bajirao Mastani provides viewers with exactly what they want - entertainment and aesthetic delight, and in this regard, the film is a delightful cinematic experience. Pure delight.",

      "reviewBody": "(No Spoilers here)\n\nWhen fans of the iconic team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy think of them, it is primarily their work that came out of the Hal Roach Studios that comes to mind. Whether in films from the waning days of the silent film period or through their work in short subjects and features through the 1930&apos;s, their often hilarious predicaments have burned a definite series of images in the minds and hearts of fans for over ninety years.\n\nIn the new film directed by John S. Baird, viewers are treated to that era in time but only briefly. The story of &quot;Stan &amp; Ollie&quot; concerns itself with the least documented period of their careers; their British Tour of 1953. By this time, &quot;The Boys&quot; are years removed from their halcyon days as the top comedians in motion pictures. Away from the cameras, Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy perform on the stage for fans who grew up with them and still love them.\n\n&quot;At the end of the day we could have tried to do exactly what they did&quot;, John C Reilly (Oliver Hardy) explained to Ross Owen who was one of the consultants on the film, &quot;but I don&apos;t think it would&apos;ve been as satisfying as what we&apos;ve done which is provide a human glimpse at these two performers&quot;. I am happy to report that this is exactly what they&apos;ve done.\n\nAs Laurel and Hardy, Coogan and Reilly are wonderful whether playing the men off the stage or when recreating genuine Laurel and Hardy routines. The vocal interpretations are excellent; at times you may forget when Ollie yells, it is really Reilly!\n\nAs Stan Laurel, Steve Coogan has the difficult task of going from Laurel, the creative craft-smith and business man to Stan, the thin half of the comedy duo. Stan Laurel who Dick Van Dyke once said that while the great comedians always showed their &quot;technique&quot;, Laurel never showed his; you actually believe he is that guy.\n\nCoogan&apos;s Laurel, an older, more weathered man is still as brilliant at coming up with material, going through the paces and rigors of his work behind the scenes yet when he is Stan on stage with Hardy, the transformation is deft and lovely. You can hardly imagine that this simple comedian is the brains behind the creating of their material.\n\nFor John C. Reilly, the moments are even more subtle. There are times during the ninety eight minutes we spend with them that you forget you are watching an actor portraying Hardy. The final years of Oliver&apos;s life were beset with illness, an image few of his fans got to see which makes this portrayal more intense and riveting. The prosthetic make up created by Mark Coulier is so well done, you will lose yourself in the performance and believe you are seeing Oliver Hardy four years before his passing.\n\nEqually as captivating are the performances of Nina Arianda and Shirley Henderson as Ida Laurel and Lucille Hardy. These talented actresses worked so well together, at times it&apos;s as if we are seeing another comedy team, reminiscent of another Hal Roach duo, Anita Garvin and Marion Byron. Arianda was afforded the opportunity of hearing Ida&apos;s voice from a recording made by longtime Laurel and Hardy fan, George Mazzey; Henderson had many tapes of Lucille to work with. Both women convey the same love and protection for their respective spouses.\n\nRufus Jones, a self proclaimed lifelong fan of Laurel and Hardy (he was a member of The Sons Of The Desert) is Stan and Babe&apos;s producer of the tour, Bernard Delfont and he&apos;s a riot as the promoter who get The Boys to do things they may not want to do with the skill of a surgeon.\n\nWhile the most ardent fans of the real Laurel and Hardy will notice certain aspects of the film that don&apos;t hold to actual events as they may or may not have occurred, writer Jeff Pope has been able to condense separate events and place them together, telling the story without making the film a three hour affair.\n\nChock full with references that harken back to some of the classic films Stan and Babe made, these &quot;easter eggs&quot; do not detract the casual viewer from the proceedings. In fact, this is the perfect introduction to new viewers who may wish to seek out the treasure chest that awaits them in the Laurel and Hardy canon.\n\nInspired by the book about the British touring years by A.J. Marriot, the film is a genuine love story. Filled with heart, it is the little told account of the final performing years of Stan and Ollie and the wives and fans who loved them unconditionally. For people who will come to this story as newbies, they will understand the friendship and caring these men had for each other. For those who watch as lifelong fans, bring your handkerchief because this is one love story with the happy ending we&apos;ve wanted to know.",

      "reviewBody": "24 Hour Party People is just one of those movies that has that click with the subject matter. The actual style of the film corresponds with the music, the irreverence, and the energy of it all. But there&apos;s more than just the unconventionality of the script and direction; the film has that sort of stream-of-thought, wry, distinct British humor to it, and a sincerity beneath the absurdist parts. It follows its main character down the line, in a surreal way like a documentary, if that makes sense- we move between Tony Wilson addressing the audience (played by Steve Coogan, who is so on target with the honesty of the portrayal you can&apos;t picture anyone else in the role), an almost behind-the-scenes filming of it (I think), and a dramatization shot on pure digital, independent vibes.\n\nWilson, who sees the Sex Pistols play in Manchester (his hometown, and the main base and heart in the location of this film), is also a journalist on television. He gets so enamored with what he sees as an extremely important part of history (the viewer will get a good idea of this), he gets involved with the bands, the locals, and goes from just bands, to maintaining the Hacienda, a club. Some parts of the film one might expect, if considering it includes the rise and fall of fame (or rather, in this film, a lot of times in the mind), and the drug scene coinciding with the music. One knows that Tony Wilson is the main character, the protagonist, basically in every scene, but somehow he does not become the only important part of the film&apos;s success. The music too is a huge factor, and the speed it sets for a movie like this.\n\nAs much biography as musical, 24 Hour Party People brings to light the scene of Manchester as a history lesson, but an entertaining one to boot. Bands like New Order (the form after Joy Division split) will be known to most who follow music, but unless if you&apos;re not really steeped in the new-wave/dance scene of the 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s, some of the bands may sound totally unfamiliar. Still, this is not an automatic deterrent- the music is what it is, and most who will want to see the film will know what they&apos;re getting (in truth, the ratio of British punk and new-wave vs. electronica is fairly balanced). But even when some of the music doesn&apos;t stand the test of time, it serves the story all the same (some of the more interesting and darkly funny scenes are when no one comes to the club the sort of &apos;mix-way&apos; between the two musical eras).\n\nAnd all through this, Coogan plays it like a pro. The Coogan Wilson, of course, is far from the real Tony Wilson (one of the DVD interviews says he&apos;s a &apos;Jerry Springer&apos;-looking type), so it becomes more of being a character in this whole environment that springs up around and by him. In a way he&apos;s kind of like a British Andy Warhol with the idealistic, serious journalist instead of the painter/filmmaker. There&apos;s a sort of checked insanity that underlays some of his performance, and yet for most of the time, like a lot of the better British actors, he doesn&apos;t play it more for laughs than he needs, and when serious drama/tragedy comes up it&apos;s still kept to this reality. So, along with him, and the music, and the strange form of putting together a dramatized, documentary/musical/black comedy by director Michael Winterbottom and writer Frank Cottrell Boyce, it all gels. This is one of the finest sleepers I&apos;ve seen in a while.",

      "reviewBody": "Very nice movie, a bit slow. Kate Beckinsale refuses to not look completely edible even when she has jail scenes, while Vera Farmiga looks just as good as to make one think it will be a movie about a cat fight. But it is far from it. I think the best acted role in this movie belongs to Matt Dillon, though.\n\nThe film portrays the trials (pun intended) of an American journalist who is jailed and then imprisoned for withholding the source of her article. Why? Because it involved matters of national security. Is national security more important than truth and integrity? The movie tries to explain why it is not by detailing how deep this is inscribed in the U.S. legislation. Basically, you can say whatever you want, just not what they don&apos;t want you to say.\n\nKate Beckinsale does a very good role, a bit airy and a bit brave. &quot;A water walker&quot;, someone calls her character in the film. Best description ever :) David Schwimmer manages to be annoying in this one, as well.\n\nBottom line: a must see movie, however keep in mind that even if it based on the true story of Valerie Plame, it is very loosely so. Yet, without being American, my guess is that the legislation portrayed in the film exists and any reporter could and would go through the main character&apos;s ordeal if having enough backbone.",

      "reviewBody": "I just saw this at Twin Cities Film Fest this weekend. The 33 chronicled the event that gripped the international community when 33 Chilean miners were buried under 100- year-old gold and copper mine and trapped for 69 days.\n\nDirector Patricia Riggen did a phenomenal job telling a compelling story of human resilience and the courage of both the miners and their families above ground who refused to give up. Great ensemble cast featuring Antonio Banderas, Juliette Binoche, Lou Diamond Philips, Rodrigo Santoro, and Gabriel Byrne. It was exquisitely shot by Checco Varese, which was shot on location in two different mines in Bolivia, Colombia. It certainly looked authentic as the environment of the set made the actors felt as if they were real miners for a while. The 33 miners were also consulted for the film.\n\nThere were moments that might have felt too &apos;Hollywoodized&apos; but overall the film didn&apos;t feel emotionally manipulated. The genuinely stirring score came from the late James Horner, which the film paid tribute in the end. It&apos;s not a perfect film but I think the film was respectful to the subject matter and did the story and those miners justice.\n\n– read more new releases reviews on FlixChatter.net",

      "reviewBody": "I just saw this movie at the Festival du Nouveau Cinéma in Montréal (Canada), and allow me to tell you that it&apos;s a must see film for everyone. I&apos;m a big Van Damme fan and I have all the films he ever made so I&apos;m gonna concentrate my comment around Van Damme. The first thing I&apos;ll say is that this movie is his best and possibly one of the best movies of the year. Going to the theatre, I wasn&apos;t expecting a masterpiece, after all it&apos;s Jean Claude Van Damme and you see his movies for the action and his high kicks not for his acting. But the director made all the difference in Jean Claude&apos;s performance. The concept itself helps a lot. Van Damme is playing himself, so he&apos;s not playing one of his stereotyped roles. Furthermore, him speaking in his native language made a huge impact on his performance. He&apos;s more natural and more authentic which made him more credible. Compared to all other movies he appeared in, this is a revelation. The comedic tone of the movie is also something to be noted. The jokes are well done but what makes the difference is the jokes focused on Van Damme. The reference to his roundhouse kicks are just hilarious. Two moments especially shine in this regard. The first one is the demonstration in the post office and the second one happens towards the end of the film. You just can&apos;t miss them and they have that good old classic Van Damage feel to them. Also worth mentioning are his personal goofy quotes in french. The one when he&apos;s interviewed by a french journalist who asks him about the total of 1+1 will leave you breathless. Not to mention the courthouse sequence which was so funny. But the best moment of the movie remains his monologue to the camera. For five minutes, or so, he goes back to his life. He talks about how he believed in the American dream, his drug and marriage problems, how Hollywood screwed him up ,how he wants so bad to be granted a second chance etc. It&apos;s a classic cinema moment in all senses. It felt more a confession than anything else. It was moving and genuine and you can feel the human being behind The Muscles from Brussels image. The other thing to be noted is the long shot at the beginning of the movie. It was hilarious and it summarizes in a sense all of Van Damme&apos;s career: Gunfights, high kicks, goofy acting you name them. In the end, the direction of the film really sets it apart from any other Van Damme&apos;s movies. The director knew how to get the best of Van Damme and put together a film that felt genuine and true. However, some questions remain. What&apos;s Van Damme going to do from now on? Will he be recognized as an accomplished actor? Will he get scripts that show him more as a human being rather than a bulk of muscles? Will he be making more European films rather than keep on making straight to DVD films? I can&apos;t say, but one thing remains for certain: JCVD is the rebirth of JCVD.",

Though the budget wasn&apos;t huge and the special effects look low-grade by today&apos;s standards the acting is good and the message is powerful. It resonated with me on a number of levels. It is also a very interesting story. It doesn&apos;t matter whether you believe in the supernatural or psychic abilities or any of that, it is still intriguing. After someone very close to me passed away the movie became even more significant to me. I could really relate to his confusion and the feelings of madness, the anger and questioning of your own sanity. If you are dealing with a tragic loss or asking big questions about life, death and the after-life, this movie might give you something new to ponder, or distract you for a while - in a useful way - from your private pain and grief. Eventually, you might even find it offers some small comfort.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Atlee&apos; has become a dependable brand with just 2 films &apos;Raja Rani&apos; and &apos;Theri&apos;,both which were efficiently packed masala entertainers that managed to gain humongous success at the Kollywood box- office.Naturally,the expectations were sky-high from the combo of Vijay and Atlee who were expected to repeat the success of Theri,which I felt was to some extent a slightly better movie altogether on comparison with this much more predictable mass masala entertainer.\n\nAn elaborate affair running around 170 minutes,Mersal has all the ingredients that one conjoins with a festival entertainer,heavily relying upon the charisma of Vijay who ensures that the loopholes in the screenplay is overshadowed by his massive screen presence up to a good extent.K.Vijayendra Prasad who&apos;s known for his epic mass entertainers like &apos;Baahubali&apos;,&apos;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&apos; and &apos;Samarasimha Reddy&apos; has stick on to the basic formulas of a typical masala flick,the result being an average to above average cinematic experience in a nutshell.\n\nAtlee&apos;s pattern of narrative reminded me of his mentor Shankar&apos;s 2006 blockbuster &apos;Shivaji&apos;,revamped with plot elements similar to A.R Murugadoss&apos;s Vijayakanth starrer &apos;Ramana&apos;[2002] and a conclusion upon the lines of yet another Murugadoss flick Katthi [2014].The introductory portions of the movie was impressive followed by a slightly weaker 45-50 minutes which luckily ended with a thrilling interval block.The second half holds the flashback portion of &apos;Thalapathy&apos; which is highly emotional and has moments to connect with the native audience in particular.\n\nThe fact that the easily predictable narrative could have been trimmed by at least 15-20 minutes cannot be blanked out and hadn&apos;t there been a solid performance by Thalapathy Vijay as the saving grace,the movie could have been rather a mediocre experience altogether.The plethora of hard-hitting punch dialogues added with a good social message towards the end was effective in increasing the emotional connect of the movie.\n\nAs mentioned before Vijay was at his awesome best throughout the movie and succeeded in portraying the roles entrusted on him with required perfection.The pick among the female cast was Nithya Menon who shined with an energetic performance.Samantha and Kajal Agarwal didn&apos;t have much role to play except for being part in two songs that didn&apos;t make any impact in the narrative whatsoever.&apos;Vaigai Puyal&apos; Vadivelu gave an impressive supporting performance .S J Surya&apos;s villain role was too stereotypical and lacked necessary detailing.\n\nSongs by maestro A.R.R ranged from mediocre to good with the pick among the songs being &apos;Aalaporaan Tamizhan&apos; and &apos;Nee Thaane&apos; that were picturized well by Atlee.The background score of the movie wasn&apos;t exceptional but nonetheless decent.Frames by debutante G K Vishnu were catchy and edits by Ruben was fine in general.\n\nOverall,Mersal is a satisfactory festive flick that ensures a paisa vasool one time watch for those who have a taste for masala entertainers.",

It is rare to find witty educated authors who are able to identify with the 5-10yr old crowd. The movie however was a far cry from the book, nevertheless the family and I enjoyed it very much. I am personally tired of the movies that focus on the parents more and the kids less (Bolt, The Incredibles etc..). The movie is a great movie particularly if you want to have a great talk with the kids on the way home about honor and bravery. \n\nWas it the book? No and I prefer the book, but the movie is good entertainment in it&apos;s own right. Give it a chance, it will touch you.",

      "name": "Dilwale is Rohit Shetty&apos;s worst movie. It&apos;s painfully fake and hopelessly contrived; an assembly-line piece of garbage that mistakes the audience for a fool.",
      "reviewBody": "Here&apos;s the thing with Rohit Shetty movies: we know it&apos;s going to be the leave-your-brain-behind type. We know it&apos;s not going to make any sense. We know the internet trolls and the twitterati are going to bite into the movie even before it releases.\n\nAnd yet we watch it. For the simple reason that he makes us laugh.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of Chennai Express, the jokes had dried up, the quips and the crisp dialogue had thinned, and the monotony was there to be seen. Singham Returns exposed that even further.\n\nBut this one takes the cake.\n\nDilwale is Rohit Shetty&apos;s worst movie. It&apos;s painfully fake and hopelessly contrived; an assembly-line piece of garbage that mistakes the audience for a fool.\n\nSo we have Shah Rukh Khan playing Kaali (go figure!), a retired son of a mafia boss, who lives with his younger brother Veer (Varun Dhawan) in Goa, the setting of many of Shetty&apos;s films. Veer&apos;s love interest is Ishita (a lovely Kriti Sanon). And Kaali has a brief, turbulent love-hate past with Meera (Kajol) in Bulgaria, which catches up with him later in his life.\n\nIn the midst of all this there are mafia bosses, a local Goan don for the villain, a sidekick (Varun Sharma, aces it) and the usual Rohit Shetty comedians thrown in for good measure.\n\nThis is a movie laced with stereotypes. Be it the step brothers with one of them being an orphan, or the painfully obvious plot twists, ones which can be seen from a mile away.\n\nIn terms of performances, there&apos;s not much to do for Kriti Sanon except for looking really pretty. Varun Dhawan has done this kind of goofy man-child role in Main Tera Hero before; he&apos;s pretty much the same here.\n\nKajol looks simply stunning, she&apos;s aged beautifully. Her acting credentials were never in doubt, but she&apos;s saddled with such a hopeless role and cringeworthy dialogue.\n\nShah Rukh sleepwalks through this role, just like he&apos;s done in Happy New Year and Chennai Express. He&apos;s an absolute bore; his eyes grim and his face stoic.\n\nWhat is most disappointing is that the hullabaloo surrounding this movie was about the coup that Shetty managed to pull off with SRK and Kajol, unquestionably Bollywood&apos;s most chemically potent pair, and yet their chemistry is almost non-existent in Dilwale. Not being able to capitalize on SRK-Kajol&apos;s pair just goes to show what a shoddy mess the movie is. Yes, there are the occasional sparks, like the silent nod to the &apos;palat&apos; scene from DDLJ, but those are few and far between.\n\nAlmost all the lines fall flat, which is disappointing, especially coming from dialogue writers like Sajid-Farhad. The scenes look farcical, the acting extremely fake, and the jokes forced. Barely a couple of laughs are generated, mainly due to the ever-reliable Johnny Lever and another Priyadarshanesque montage leading to a hilariously confusing story.\n\nShetty has always been &apos;inspired&apos; by various films, as evidenced by the Golmaal series, Bol Bachchan and even Singham. With Dilwale, not only has he taken bits and pieces from trashy potboilers of the 80s, but this time he&apos;s gone further and taken a page out of a TV show.\n\nIn the middle of the once-amazing CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, protagonist Ted Mosby meets a woman called Stella, and due to shortage of time, he takes her on a two-minute date, an extremely endearing montage, and one of the highlights of the show. Our man Shetty blatantly copies the concept, and it&apos;s neither impressive nor heartwarming.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame to see Rohit Shetty start taking the audience for granted to such an extent. It&apos;s even more shameful that Shah Rukh Khan agreed to not only act in this mess, but also produce it. Dilwale is a mistake that will be difficult to erase.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of the movie, Varun Dhawan is proposing to Kriti Sanon. And in a bid to go all out, he plans to do the one thing that simply can&apos;t fail in Bollywood - SRK&apos;s arms-raised pose.\n\nHe prays, &apos;Bhaiya, sambhaal lena&apos;. Sure, he gets the girl. But not even his bhaiya can save this atrocity of a movie.",

      "reviewBody": "YOUNG GUNS 2 was a stunning achievement, a sequel that managed to surpass its brilliant predecessor, 1988&apos;s YOUNG GUNS.  YOUNG GUNS 2 follows the story of Billy the Kid, already an outlaw and now riding with the cow thief Pat Garrett.  Garrett is offered the position of Sheriff by the Governor, who finds himself constantly cowed in his efforts to catch Billy the Kid.  In the Governor&apos;s mind, you must hire a thief to catch one, hence Garrett is the perfect choice.  Pat Garrett, who has long planned to go respectable, siezes the opportunity and turns on his friend and partner.  What follows is a great western adventure, rich with themes of sin and redemption and the tragedy of brother against brother.  That alone makes a great flick.  But then YOUNG GUNS 2 offers the question... what if Pat Garrett was conflicted about his choice?  What if he still had feelings for the Kid?  What if he let him go?  This is good stuff, folks.  The leads do the material justice, with Estevez jumping back into the role of Billy like an old and comfortable suit that still fits perfectly.  William Petersen gives a nuanced performance as Pat Garrett, a man driven by both loyalty and selfishness.  Of course no review of this film should fail to herald the talents of Lou Diamond Phillips.  Phillips is an actor who constantly seems to raise the bar for himself, and YOUNG GUNS 2 is no exception.  His Chavez is MORE spiritual, MORE effortlessly wise... dare I say MORE Indian than he was even in the first installment.  Hopefully, Phillips will be with us for a very long time.  Kiefer Sutherland, Christian Slater, Balthazar Getty, and Alan Ruck round out the talented cast.  So finally, do yourself a favor with this one, YOUNG GUNS 2 is an amazing film experience."

It was a tough time in the 20s for women and that they definitely got accurate in the story. The characters are all really complex in their own way, and the acting was superb.

Even though its been just a few minutes since I finished watching it, I can already tell that the images and characters will be playing in my head for a very long time.\n\nThis move is an absolute gem -- see it if at all possible!"

      "reviewBody": "I have trouble with the comments of users who find no emotional attachment to sad characters. Those who state that all the characters in this film wouldn&apos;t be missed if a tornado did wipe them out - isn&apos;t this the ultimate prejudice? Isn&apos;t it telling that these people have no sympathy for characters that are children who&apos;ve been given no other options? Could it be that the pervasiveness of this attitude is exactly why there seems to be no cure for the plight of poverty?\n\nCould it possibly be that THIS is the point of this film?\n\n So few want to get inside the real problems to understand what&apos;s going on. It is impossible to understand anything fully from the outside looking in. I think films (and books, and music, and lectures, etc.) like this are needed to counteract the fantasies that we regularly accept as reality. Is this reality for most people? No, probably not, but it is for some and all stories need telling. In a world-view where wrestling chairs and killing pets are considered acceptable and worthwhile activities, would we really expect to feel a sense of plot or unfolding or striving? The point, it seems to me, is that for people trapped in these situations, there is no point, no goals, no worthwhile transformations. They can&apos;t even begin to see these things. All that&apos;s left by this tragedy of human existence is meaningless, chaotic, confusing experiences that seem to make no sense, and ill-conceived rushes to relieve the frustration and anxiety in whatever means seem readily available. Do you understand why people cut themselves to feel better? Or starve themselves? Or abuse people? I don&apos;t. But for our culture&apos;s sake, I hope some people care enough to try to find out.\n\nTragedy, for anyone who has ever personally experienced it, leaves one without faith, hope, or any possibility of transcendence. Without these higher-level world-views, we revert to self-protective mere survival. When this strikes a larger community, it has disastrous effects. This film shows just how fragile our safety net of community, progress, and culture really are - how easily they can be unraveled.\n\nI know it&apos;s hard for us to see this. How can these characters not see that there is a better way available? Don&apos;t they watch TV or movies? Don&apos;t they see what we see? But this is precisely the point we have to understand. They really don&apos;t. People who live in ghettos don&apos;t get degrees because they don&apos;t even know that they can. They believe that these areas are for others, not them. We&apos;ll never understand class problems if we don&apos;t try to see them from all perspectives.\n\nI, too, felt horrified to find myself on the &quot;inside&quot; of this lifestyle - something I hope never to do in a non-filmic experience. This is the genius to which people are referring - the director and actors&apos; ability to draw those of us for whom these are alien experiences directly and completely into this hopeless, pointless world. We actually feel the dread, frustration, meaninglessness that people caught in these circumstances experience.\n\nThis is why I read, go to movies, listen to music and experience all art - to experience life from the many different perspectives available. If you only want to be entertained - there really are only a few stories to tell and there are many &quot;artists&quot; out there willing to serve you the same McArt to &quot;satisfy&quot; your needs, but for those of us who would like to know more about something other than ourselves and our ethnocentric, narcissistic experiences, movies like Gummo will always be admired. And there&apos;s nothing wrong with entertainment. I like it too. But don&apos;t judge films like this based on that standard. It isn&apos;t fair. You don&apos;t say &quot;I don&apos;t like Mozart because it doesn&apos;t have a beat I can dance to.&quot; Or maybe you do. And so, you should be able to understand how some people have no way to access another transcendent point of view.\n\nI also have to make a comment about the &quot;meaninglessness&quot; of the bunny suit boy. I didn&apos;t understand the symbolism either - and according the director&apos;s comments, there doesn&apos;t seem to be any - at least not in any direct, conscious way. And this is probably difficult for any non-artist to understand, but sometimes instinct doesn&apos;t take on any direct symbolic reference but is still important. Artist&apos;s trust their instincts and don&apos;t always have to have everything make sense in a literal sense. In fact, it is generally agreed that works of art that are too directly symbolic, or too literal lose much of the magic that makes art special in the first place. I&apos;m not condoning ambiguity for the sake of ambiguity, but the bunny suit seemed so absurdist to me that it set the tone for the absurdity that followed. In a strange way, it seemed hopeful. This effect isn&apos;t lessened by the director&apos;s inability to explain why it was important. The fact is, it was important on some instinctive level or it wouldn&apos;t have been cut in.\n\nListen to any of your favorite music and try to find a &quot;plot&quot; or a &quot;meaning&quot; for each and every line and note. Unless you listen exclusively to bad country and western I think you&apos;ll get this point. A lot of people think other forms of art have more responsibility to be crystal clear, but I doubt most of us prefer these same attributes in our music. If you understand half of what you sing along to, you are among the few. I think the problem is that most of us expect something different from film, art, novels because we&apos;ve been fed so much crap that (similar to my kids when they come back from a week at a friend or family member&apos;s house where fast food is the daily fare) we cannot taste the goodness of real meals. Think about it."

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s something about the use of the monkey to characterise Robbie Williams that makes this quite a visceral watch at times. The film tells the story of the fairly turbulent rise of this &quot;Take That&quot; singer from boyhood exponent of Gilbert and Sullivan to a man on the right end of an £80 millions record deal. His dad (Steve Pemberton) went off to a football match whilst he was a child and never came back, and that left him with his mum &quot;Janet&quot; (Kate Mulvany) and adoring nan (Alison Steadman) living a pretty much hand to mouth existence and leaving him with a pretty solid foundation for his later emotional and trust issues. Unless you&apos;ve lived on the moon these last twenty years, then you&apos;ll know much of what happens next. What does make this stand out a little more is the fact that Williams himself is behind the project and is in no way afraid to portray himself as a complete ass. His drink, drugs, tantrums and generally spoilt brattishness are laid bare with little, if any, attempt to sanitise. In some ways it reminded me of the recent &quot;Amy&quot; biopic and came hot on the heels of a recent viewing of &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948) with both serving, for completely different reasons, to augment the thrust of this story of a person who attained great stardom, success and wealth - and ultimately ended up with addictions galore and few, real, friends amidst a sea of hangers-on and parasites all too eager to selfishly cash in on the fame of a lad who started aged just fifteen. Of course it&apos;s not exactly balanced, and I&apos;m sure the gospel according to Robbie might not be quite how others see their own behaviour (or his) but there is an honesty to this that brings home just how ruthless the music business is and at just how fickle fame can be when those we idolise lose their lustre. It doesn&apos;t do it any harm that many of his solo songs work well through big screen audio with some classy string arrangements and powerful vocals to remind us that, unlike many of the largely forgotten &quot;Take That&quot; singles, his music - especially the stuff he made with Guy Chambers - is the stuff we will really long remember. It&apos;s not for the faint hearted, but still well worth a watch.",

As with most romantic comedies, it&apos;s nothing deep, had some cheesy moments and was totally predictable (I figured out the whole movie in the first 10 minutes). \n\nBut I really enjoyed it all the same. I laughed a lot in this movie. Partly because I could totally relate to trying to live life under the radar as woman that doesn&apos;t look like a model. Plus it was refreshing to see an African American woman shown with some depth in a movie. Not just the mean black woman.\n\nThere was very little cussing, little sexuality, and no nudity. Truly refreshing these days. \n\nIf you just want to enjoy a movie without having to put too much thought into it, go see this movie.",

Predictably excellent performances from Cate Blanchett, Tommy Lee Jones, and a fantastic performance from Eric Schweig as the Apache witch doctor. I was surprised to discover the film was mostly dumped on by critics in the US, and bombed there. It&apos;s had a much better response here, as I think it should have. Look out also for Evan Rachel Wood, so good in &apos;Thirteen&apos;, as the older of Blanchett&apos;s two daughters. This ranks as Ron Howard&apos;s best.",

I liked her scenes with Theron&apos;s Andy. Uma Thurman is a terrific villain. I enjoyed the fight choreography until the climactic battle. I would be very happy to never see another helicopter in an action movie climax. At this point they trigger only eye rolls from me.\n\nGiven that I have a weakness for Matthias Schoerharts gorgeous eyes and Charlize swinging a labrys, I will generously give this disappointing movie 5 stars.",

(especially the beginning, with Rain Wilson chasing after his ex-band mates in the van, WOW, i literally almost fell out of my chair! I love unpredictable crazy moments like that...and this movie was full of them.....)\n\nIm a huge fan of Rain Wilson, and I KNOW he&apos;s an underdog actor who is not being used to his full potential.\n\nI just LOVE how his character is throughout the movie, he&apos;s just got this whole Jack-Black meets Dwight(from the Office) thing going on! He does a very good job of portraying a kind of washed up crazy rock star, yet still very sharp and witty at times....he just seems to be able to switch them on and off during the movie.\n\nOverall this movie was A lot better than i thought, had a very good rock flow to it, yet positive mood.\n\nIf you see this movie, go into it NOT expecting much!(just like the trailers make you think) You&apos;ll be most likely surprised by all the witty funny moments that just flare out of nowhere!\n\n-----\n\nTHE GOOD - \n\n-Rain Wilson is VERY funny -He does a good job acting, &quot;The Office&quot; fans will like it -Movie has a decent positive storyline IMO -The costumes were PRICELESS -The faces Rain makes, and his quotes were excellent..(not quite as weird/good as the Office, but definitely good enough.) -Alot of unpredictable little quick moments and quotes!\n\nTHE BAD -\n\n-I couldn&apos;t stand the borderline EMO sounding songs the band played thru-out the movie sometimes!(although Rain was still his hardcore self and never missed a friggin beat!) -The storyline just suddenly moves REAL FAST...then all of a sudden slows back down to normal speed....like how they suddenly get a record contract,etc....",

      "reviewBody": "Taking another chance on L.A, on the streets and more specifically on the police, as in &quot;Dark Blue&quot;, Ron Shelton, a man of multiple themes, brings a new project to the table, which is called &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot;. The difference between this one and the latter one is that this is Hollywood, precisely. And when the beginning credits roll, and we&apos;re shown fifty &quot;Hollywood&quot; signs; it&apos;s obvious that they want us to realize that. Why would it be? \n\nThe story about Ron Shelton meeting Robert Souza in the set of &quot;Dark Blue&quot; and them both getting together to write the script of &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot;, because Souza had been a cop beforeInteresting. However, in the same vein, &quot;Dark Blue&quot; is the portrait of a cruel reality; &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot; is the satire of a shallow but real reality in the end. It&apos;s Hollywood, and it was a good premise to put some fun in the crime scenes, probably to make it &quot;more dramatic than anything seen in Hollywood&quot;.\n\nThe other elements the plot offers go from action to crime, or vice versa. They created the murderer of a rap band, so they could mess a little bit with the music business, too. There we see the producers, the groups, the &quot;showbiz&quot;It&apos;s even related with theater and movies, because one of the main characters wants to be an actor; and in a decent comedic way, he&apos;s thinking about acting each time he&apos;s doing something; and he probably isn&apos;t that good.\n\nI&apos;m talking about K.C Calden; Josh Hartnett&apos;s character. He gives classes of movements to find the inner self. There, a lot of hot women assist and kiss him when they leave. In one scene, his partner tells him that he did for sex. &quot;At first it was for sex, now it has become something spiritual&quot;, K.C answers, and at night, a hot woman is waiting for him in the &quot;Jacuzzi&quot;. &quot;How long has it been since the last time you got laid&quot;, K.C asks his partner. &quot;It&apos;s not your business&quot;, the partner says. Then, he lets a man working as a prostitute into his car. When they discuss that, he says: &quot;It was nothing, it was a man, a cop; a cop man&quot;.\n\nThis partner is Joe Gavilan, a pro in the police business played by a pro in the acting business. As he did with Kurt Russell in &quot;Dark Blue&quot;, Shelton brings Harrison Ford back to the top of his game. With his character, based on writer Robert Souzas&apos;s own life, he has the best lines and he has a lot of fun. Antoine Sartain (Isaiah Washington) should be afraid of him; a man that has had sex, with Ruby (an over the top Lena Olin) and makes real estate business with producer Jerry Duran (the great Martin Landau) and Julius Armas (a correct Master P) while he&apos;s driving a car high speed. When he is told the composer of the rap group is still alive, he replies: &quot;Somebody actually writes that s***?&quot;. He has had bad times, Bennie Macko (Bruce Greenwood) wants to get him, and in the best scene of the movie, he and K.C get interrogated. This scene is managed with camera changes between the two interrogating rooms, where in Joe&apos;s, his cell is always ringing; and in K.C&apos;s, he is &quot;centering&quot; himself spiritually. Joe&apos;s interrogator can&apos;t do anything, while K.C&apos;s interrogator (a woman) asks him to help her relax.\n\nThat scene stole the only laughs from me during the entire film. Keith David was also having fun in his Leo role, reprising some of the comic elements he gave to Lester Wallace in &quot;Barbershop&quot;. More importantly, and if you were wondering, Shelton directs his actors perfectly, making a stupendous balance between the pro and the amateur, the old and the young; Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett. Their chemistry is perfect, and one of the few reasons to watch the movie. In the end, their characters are nothing else but cops, in a film that leaves a lot of plot situations unresolved, is a bit long, not funny enough, but different from the gross humor that everyone finds easy to put on paper.",

There is rarely good chemistry between leads, there&apos;s always a childish huff involved, there&apos;s usually a cheating or suspected cheating that goes on, they&apos;re not really romantic.\n\nThis story is boy meets girl, they fall in love, fate parts them but they manage to get back together.\n\nIt&apos;s a beautiful, fabulous story, a true romance. I actually believed in every character on screen and could relate to many of the scenes. All rom coms should follow this path from now on.\n\nThe acting from everyone is sublime (Haley Lu Richardson always is), the dialogue is never cheesy, the photography is beautiful and the direction smooth and brilliantly paced. The narrator constantly popping up is a great idea and Jamil makes this work so well.\n\nThis is one of the best rom coms ever made, I love it.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie wasn&apos;t awful, to me at least. People seem upset about it because it is being marketed as a remake of the original movie. I have never seen the original so I can&apos;t compare however I do know that it is extremely different.\n\nI actually think that would have solved a big chunk of the complaints if they had just called it a different name. Not wrong turn. It seems distinct enough for it to be its own thing.\n\nFor me, I appreciated the &quot;twist&quot; because it was refreshing. The way they handled it however was the issue. This movie was being pulled six ways from Sunday in every direction. It&apos;s is an absolute mess.\n\nIt tires to Villainise it&apos;s protagonists while making it&apos;s villains look good but then chickens out and just scraps it all for a boring story. It has really interesting ideas in here that it just puts out to die. I actually think that the big reveal in the middle of the fun should have been the end. It would have been a real guy punch and really shocking.\n\nSpeaking of endings, Jesus Christ this film has about 5. Mid way though the first act seems like a climax and I was like &quot;no this can&apos;t be the end yet it&apos;s just started&quot;, then again the second act seems like a climax but where was still so much time left. Then you get to the real climax in the third act and it ends...oh no wait it doesn&apos;t it goes on again. So then it has this other ending tacked on but no wait that wasn&apos;t the real ending either so it carries on again then it finally has its ending and the title card appears....then it still goes on and had another final scene Immediately after the title card shows. That is just insane to me. It was just so structurally bizarre.\n\nEven the beginning is strange and feels out of place and should be moved to else where in the movie.\n\nThis issue also reflects in the run time, this movie is too long for this sort of story. I think they just didn&apos;t want to cut things. There is so much that could have just been left on the floor but they wanted it all in, that&apos;s why it has 100 endings because I think they thought they were all too good to throw out.\n\nYou could maybe watch it but don&apos;t expect it to be like the others in the series.",

This is not to say that the whole thing is bad.  It is just that the ending is just over done.  The whole &apos;tricked-ya&apos; thing is a little old, but still acceptable.

Don&apos;t watch it, it is a 2 hours long suffering. The sounds are unclassifiable, you can&apos;t hear the dialogues in the most scenes. The story is untraceable. The acting performance is below average, it seems they did it only for a lot of money.\n\nThe purpose of the film isn&apos;t the entertainment. It has just one purpose: character murder of Klára Dobrev before the Hungarian election in April, 2022. Tiny beauty flaw that the prime minister nominee isn&apos;t Dobrev.\n\nSo my rating is 1* becaust this isn&apos;t a real movie, this is just another one propaganda product of the Hungarian government from the tax-payers money. From that money which could be much more useful in the health care or in the education, where people earn less money than an operator in a factory. This is a shame...",

As expected, he goes after them, but with the catch he&apos;s slowly suffering from Alzheimer&apos;s. The final act takes a few twists and turns one wouldn&apos;t expect and the additions of Guy Pearce and Monica Bellucci along with some solid gore defiantly help.

Having said that, Varisu sticks to the age old family drama template mixed with masala elements to do justice to it&apos;s superstar lead. The rebellious younger son who is ousted from the family makes a comeback to mend the broken family. With enough father-son, mother-son, brothers sentiment, Vamsi Paidipally presents a done to death screenplay as a festival treat.\n\nTo speak the positives, the film is lavishly shot with vibrant colors. Vijay seems to having sheer fun playing this character and several ordinary scenes get elevated solely by his performance. With a runtime of 2hrs 50mins, the film is way too long but it is those funny moments with Vijay that makes it almost work. The predictable screenplay, weak villain and weakly written supporting cast doesn&apos;t offer anything new content wise. The action scenes too don&apos;t stand out. Despite all this, it is not a bad watch at all but Vijay saves it from being entirely bland.",

Like I said, the movie is a bit predictable. Needless to say, the party sequence is, of course, more predictable than anything else. The movie just wants to entertain, tell a worthy story, and it never gets old. So, with a movie this good, its flaws don&apos;t matter in the slightest.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Vettaiyan&quot; is a thrilling action drama that delivers on its promise of Rajinikanth&apos;s signature style and mass appeal. The film&apos;s engaging story, coupled with Thalaivar&apos;s powerful screen presence and goosebump-inducing moments, makes for a captivating first half.\n\nRajinikanth&apos;s performance as the titular character is a major highlight, showcasing his charisma and commanding presence. The action sequences are well-choreographed and visually impressive, providing ample moments of excitement for fans.\n\nHowever, the film falters in its second half, with a screenplay that loses momentum and becomes predictable. While the initial intrigue and suspense are maintained for a while, the narrative struggles to sustain its grip, leading to a somewhat underwhelming climax.\n\nDespite its flaws, &quot;Vettaiyan&quot; remains an entertaining watch for Rajinikanth fans and those seeking an action-packed drama. The film&apos;s strong performances, particularly from Rajinikanth, and its engaging first half make it worth watching. However, be prepared for a second half that doesn&apos;t quite live up to the initial promise.",

It has a nice cast and costumes. The CGI could have been better but is fine compared to other movies on Disney channel level.\n\nThe story and the characters are pretty mediocre and for my taste, they are relying too hard on clichés. On the other hand I think that some people will love it especially for this. It definitely falls into the category guilty pleasure.\n\nSo if you don&apos;t expect much and like cheesy fantasy movies for children/teenager, this movie could be something for you.\n\nIf you are not the target audience or don&apos;t like these kind of movies, stay away from it. You can&apos;t compare it to movies like Harry Potter, Panem and Maze Runner. But to be fair, I don&apos;t think that the movie ever intended to be compared with them.",

If you do, start the load and watch the laundry spin around. Every time you see the red sock pretend to be scared.\n\nThat&apos;s it. That&apos;s the equivalent to seeing this movie. As entertaining as watching your laundry dry and every bit as scary as a red sock.\n\nOthers have already punched all the holes in the plot (or complete lack thereof) that are necessary. I won&apos;t beat that dead horse. As mentioned, the acting was completely mailed in. The CGI was hokey, stilted and throw in in a lot of scenes unnecessarily. This wasn&apos;t just a really bad movie, this was a really bad horror movie. Most horror movies these days suck to one degree or another, but this moving distinguishes itself as being among the worst of the worst.

      "reviewBody": "In an old fashioned musical, the loves and losses of an extended upper-class family in Manhattan are followed in song from NY to Paris and Venice.\n\nThe company logo comes onscreen followed closely by the white title on a black background.  Seconds later we are into the first song as two young lovers walk in the park - and it&apos;s not until 100 minutes later that it lets you go again.  The plot is nothing more than lots of strands of love and loss tied together by family connections.  None of the stories really have any great significance but are backed up by wit and some charming song and dance numbers.  This is whimsy at it&apos;s very best.\n\nIt feels like Woody Allen has really relaxed and is making films that hark back to an older age - indeed his usual style is tuned down a little to make it more accessible and more enjoyable.  He has several black characters, his humour is witty but less cruel than usual and his narrative is driven by a teenage girl rather than himself.  It feels so free of his usual cynicism that it adds to the weightless charm it already has.  He handles the song and dance scene with such vigour and such imagination that you find yourself wondering why he hasn&apos;t done a musical before.\n\nThe superb cast all catch the charm and light feel perfectly.  Not all of them are great singers but they all do well and give their best (except Barrymore who refused and was dubbed).  The usual stars are complimented by plenty of well known faces - Alda, Goldie Hawn, Lucas Haas, Portman, Tim Roth, Roberts and of course the wonderful Edward Norton.\n\nThis is  100 minutes of lightweight wonder.  It has no rough edges, no difficult issues, no cruel jokes and very little swearing.  Only the coldest heart could fail to warm to this little charmer."

      "reviewBody": "I had never heard of Osmosis Jones before, but I grew up watching the animated series based on this movie so I went into it with excitement and a nostalgic drive.\n\nWhat I got was rather mixed. Let me explain.\n\nThe live-action parts pretty much sucked in my opinion. This guy named Frank (Bill Murray) is a single father taking care of his daughter and is a really unlikable father figure. How are we supposed to sympathise with a lazy and egotistical doof? I never felt sorry for him one minute. Mix that with gross-out humour which wasn&apos;t even helped the slightest by Bill Murray who is usually really funny.\n\nEnough said about that, because the animated segments were actually pretty awesome. The world inside Frank&apos;s was impressive by how it was crafted. How it functions by having a whole community run by a mayor (William Shatner) and a police force of white blood cells and a lot of real-life city stuff showcased a lot of creative effort was put into it.\n\nIt centers on a white blood cells Osmosis Jones (Chris Rock) who is that kind of cop who does things his own way and the others at the police station do not approve of his ways, but he is later assigned to a new case with a partner to keep him on track, a cold pill named Drix (David Hyde Pierce). Sure, it follows all the buddy cop movie clichés with nothing new added, but the world they must explore and the colorful characters they meet make it entertaining albeit predictable.\n\nSpeaking of the colorful cast of characters, the most interesting and memorable of them all has to be the villian Thrax (Laurence Fishburne) who is menacing and merciless and has a deathcount very high for a PG rated movie.\n\nWithout being boring I found that Chris Rock and David Hyde Pierce seemed to do their usual schtick with Rock being hip and a loudmouth and Hyde Pierce doing his quirky and excentric british gentleman voice. But Fishburne surprised me. He could as easily just have put on his Morpheus voice, but he didn&apos;t. I&apos;ll give him more credit for that.\n\nThe live-action segments is the movie&apos;s biggest drawbacks with an unlikable main character and lowbrow humour as you would expect from the farelly brothers, and frankly (no pun intented) the animated segments aren&apos;t perfect and the transitions between the two don&apos;t always work.\n\nBut overall Osmosis I found Osmosis Jones enjoyable, but flawed. I understand why it failed in theaters, but I have seen so much worse elsewhere.",

Exciting film packs intrigue , intense scenes , noisy action and astonishing suspense . The picture follows the wake of the 8os and 90s in ¨X file¨ style and invasion mania . Passable acting by Charlie Sheen as a radio astronomer who receives signal from a far planet , and gorgeous Teri Polo as his girlfriend . Enjoyable support cast , such as Richard Schiff as his best friend and assistant , Ron Silver as a nasty chief , Lindsay Crouse as a curious scientific , Leon Rippy as a hoodlum , among others . Appropriate and suspenseful musical score by Arthur Kempel . Atmospheric and colorful cinematography by Hiro Narita . \n\nThe motion picture was well written and directed by David Twohy . David is an expert writer and director of splendid Sci-Fi movies . As his first picture was the acceptable ¨Timescape¨ . He also wrote ¨Warlock¨, ¨Waterworld ¨, a script for ¨Alien 3¨ in 1988, but it was rejected . Back in May of 2000, Fox Studios once inquired for his availability to write and direct &quot;AVP: Alien vs. Predator&quot; , but turned down the offer due to scheduling conflicts . David subsequently directed ¨Below¨, the successful ¨Pich Black¨ and its sequel ¨ The chronicles of Riddick¨ .",

      "name": "Humorous, tragic, romantic, and thoughtful, Ana Lily Amirpour feature debut provides an unforgettable experience that defies labels",
      "reviewBody": "Set in Bad City, Iran, a young man named Arash (Arash Marandi) struggles with working menial jobs and setbacks coming from his drug addicted father Hossein (Marshall Manesh) whose addictions have put the both of them in debt to drug dealer Saeed (Dominic Rains). Eventually Arash has a chance encounter with a girl (Shella Vand) and strikes up a romance with her, unaware she is a vampire who predates on the bad men within the city.\n\nA Gril Walks Home Alone at Night is the feature debut of writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour. The film is an expansion on Amirpour&apos;s 2011 short film of the same name partially funded through Kickstarter with the film&apos;s goal of $55,000 exceeded with $56,903 raised from 290 backers. The movie became a hit with critics with many praising the style, direction, and performances of the film with many appreciating the thematic nods to vampire lore, spaghetti westerns, and horror. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is a movie that requires patience of its audience, but those who are willing to give it will find a unique and stylish character-based genre blender whose vision overcomes its budget.\n\nAmirpour&apos;s approach to the material is unique in that she takes a vampire, known only as The Girl, and frames her as a lone stranger who comes into town and while she does feed on those unfortunate enough to cross her path, she is not without morality as she only unleashes her appetites upon those she sees as deserving of them. The movie&apos;s usage of the fictional Iranian city of Bad City helps to give this film a unique identity especially since it&apos;s a very different portrayal of Iran than we&apos;re typically used to and it&apos;s made all the more impressive that it was filmed in Taft, California (primarily due to some of the content not meeting Iran&apos;s &quot;standards&quot;). Arash Marandi is really good playing Arash as he has this laid back charm with a slight rebellious streak you may remember from a younger Marlon Brandon or James Dean, Shella Vand is also quite good as The Girl and makes a solid anti-hero/romantic lead with Vand and Marandi having some great chemistry together. While I personally like this movie, I understand it won&apos;t be to everyone&apos;s tastes as this is a movie that does go in for long unbroken shots and a number of more deliberately paced scenes, but assuming you&apos;re willing to give the movie some leeway on that front it makes for a rewarding experience.\n\nA Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is visually and thematically impressive and made even more so by its frugal budget. With some solid leads, a unique take on vampires, and some strong visual language from Ana Lily Amirpour, I found a lot to like about this film.",

The film has Martin as a divorced tax attorney while Latifah plays a jailbird on the run who needs an attorney to prove her innocence and gives Martin plenty of &quot;tude&quot; along with some lessons in getting real as they raucously wend their way through countless comedic contrivances. Personally I enjoyed this busy top-of-the-marquee comedy romp a lot. However, it requires being able to find humor in the juxtaposition of Martin and Latifah which, judging from comments elsewhere on this website, not everyone did. (B)",

      "reviewBody": "My first 2011 film. It&apos;s a pretty unambitious comedy, but it survives because of a fantastic cast. Too fantastic, really. I have to wonder what drew them to this rather middling material. Ed Helms (of The Office and The Daily Show) stars as a sheltered insurance salesman from a small town in northern Wisconsin who is drafted by his boss (Stephen Root) to go to an insurance conference in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He&apos;s pretty inexperienced with life outside his own little bubble, and he gets led astray by troublemaker John C. Reilly. The film also co-stars Isaiah Whitlock, Jr. (who co-starred in HBO&apos;s The Wire, a series for which the character espouses a lot of love), Anne Heche (extremely good - probably the only good thing I&apos;ve ever seen her done), Sigourney Weaver, Alia Shawkat (of the TV series (not the rap group) Arrested Development) and Kurtwood Smith (of That 70s Show and RoboCop). I wanted to see this one because of its Midwestern setting. Part of me was afraid that it would be Hollywood making fun of Midwesterners, but it&apos;s pretty gentle. Helms may play a sheltered small-town guy, but it&apos;s just him (Reilly&apos;s character is from Steven&apos;s Point, WI, and he&apos;s not a rube; he is a drunk, though). The film actually has a lot of affection for the Midwest, and it has a lot of heart.",

Stars align themselves and his fortune is reversed when he is offered a job by the man who evicted him from his home.\n\n&quot;99 Homes&quot; has an intense beginning that absorbs me into the story. The circumstances it portrays is very real and relevant to people in lower income brackets, and their pain of losing their homes is piercingly recreated. I feel so sorry for Dennis because he appears to be such a hard-working, honest and amicable guy. As the story progresses, he is faced with various moral dilemmas. The story is captivating, and it&apos;s helped by the intensity of the marvellous performances of Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield. It is a very good and thought provoking film, that leaves me wondering about the rights and wrongs of Rick and Dennis."

No longer mega studios have to make a movie based on a formula to engage as many audience as possible .\n\nYou can tell that this movie is a passion project. Yes, it still follows some typical heist film formula, but we who love heist movies basically know how everyone of these movies end. Still, it has some twists and turns, and even a slightly unexpected ending.\n\nThe comedy isn&apos;t laugh out loud, but there is plenty to make you smile. While tile The Instigators, isn&apos;t some original breakthrough, but neither is any movie put out by mega budget films.\n\nThe Instigators, at least has plenty of new themes to offer, we don&apos;t get bogged down by some needless romantic subplot. And it&apos;s in the end a satire poking fun at other heist films, and yet retains the intensity of what one is to expect from a caper.\n\nEnjoy!",

Kilmer proves adept at excellent comic timing, and he is given a motherlode of razor-sharp one-liners to fire off in every scene (I speculate that writer Pat Proft enjoyed watching The Marx Brothers in his formative years).  Chief drawback of this film is the hammy, sneering villain played by Atherton -- as the old saying goes, just give him a mustache to twirl.  But if you happened to see the film as a young person, the above-mentioned won&apos;t get in the way of your fond memories.  I sure know that every time I see that slow-motion romp through the popcorn and hear Tears for Fears&apos; &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World,&quot; ramp up on the soundtrack, my cynicism just melts away."

      "reviewBody": "Promised Land (2012) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nDirector Gus Van Sant is visited from the ghost of Frank Capra in this morality tale that mixes politics, family values and greed. Natural gas salesmen Steve (Matt Damon) and Sue (Frances McDormand) head out to a small town to try and make the people vote for allowing them to drill for gas. They spread around whatever &quot;truths&quot; they must to secure the vote but soon the small town life starts to effect Steve. PROMISED LAND isn&apos;t a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it&apos;s extremely well-made, features some great acting and it really is a fun movie to sit through. There are problems including the ending, which I won&apos;t ruin for those who haven&apos;t seen the movie but I think this complicated story and issues gets solved way too easily. With that said, Van Sant was the perfect person to handle this material because in someone else&apos;s hands you&apos;re probably looking at an over-sentimental picture that is too preachy. Instead, Van Sant really paints a great picture of small town life and I thought the screenplay allowed each character to fully grow. This includes obviously the Damon character but several other smaller ones including a terrific bit by Hal Holbrook who plays a local school teacher. The material is extremely well-written and for the most part the message is always there but it&apos;s never just beating the viewer over the head. Damon turns in some of his best work in years as he&apos;s completely believable in the role of this salesman who starts to have second thoughts. I thought the actor delivered a very strong and emotional performance that really paid off. Holbrook is simply divine in his small role and McDormand is also very good in her supporting bit. Rosemarie DeWitt also adds another winning performance to her resume. PROMISED LAND, I think, could have ended a bit better but there&apos;s still something that bring it all together. The film is fairly predictable but with such strong direction and a great cast it&apos;s still very much worth seeing."

It has its moments of intensity, its greatness in the acting and directing. Its not a classic, but with all of the mediocre works that are out there to take your money, this is one that would NOT be a waste of your time.\n\nI would highly recommend this film if you are into suspense, drama, intrigue of any nature. \n\nThere are certain aspects that are left open, but so minor that it doesn&apos;t distract from the impact of the movie.\n\nAll in all -- a very good watch.\n\n6 out of 10"

The opening credits went on for way too long, and throughout you will continually say to yourself, that would never happen.\n\nHalle Berry is good, she&apos;s been dogged by some poor films, but she&apos;s never stopped being a very good actress.\n\nIf you can overlook its many flaws, you&apos;ll enjoy it.",

At the same time presenting himself as emotional family person as well as a cold-blooded ruthless interrogator is awesome.Cinematography is picturesque. However, role of heroine is limited to glamor factor. In fact few scenes involving her seemed forceful. Background score blends well with the situation. This is a must watch movie for entertaining and thrilling plot.",

    "summary": "Reviewers say 'Nonnas' is a heartwarming film centered around family, love, and Italian culture, with a focus on the emotional journey of a man opening a restaurant staffed by grandmothers. Common themes include nostalgia, the power of food in bringing people together, and the importance of cultural heritage. Reviewers often praise the performances, particularly the ensemble cast of veteran actresses playing the grandmothers. However, some critics find the story predictable and overly sentimental, with a lack of depth and originality. The film's portrayal of Italian culture and food is both celebrated and critiqued, with some feeling it captures the essence of Italian family life while others find it stereotypical. The movie is generally seen as a feel-good, comforting watch, though it may not resonate with everyone due to its formulaic nature.",

      "reviewBody": "TRUE CRIME is a sophisticated crime thriller that takes time to delve into its lead character--CLINT EASTWOOD--who promptly turns out to be very much like the Eastwood character we&apos;ve already seen in a dozen or so films--boozy, insolent, direct, and relentless when he&apos;s on the trail of a killer or playing detective with everyday citizens.\n\nIt isn&apos;t until his newspaper partner is killed in a driving accident that his conscience takes over and he decides to pursue the case that intrigued her--a case involving a man she believes is innocently awaiting sentence in California&apos;s death row.\n\nHe pleads with his newspaper boss (JAMES WOODS) to give him more time to insert himself into the case and track down the real killer. This leads to a black woman who inadvertently gives him a clue he&apos;s been searching for and to their desperate attempt to reach the governor in time to stop the execution. Scenes of the state preparing step by step to begin the process are cross-cut with Eastwood&apos;s car chase to alert the authorities in time. It makes a smashing, riveting climax.\n\nBasic storyline seems awfully familiar for anyone who has seen a movie from the &apos;40s, CALL NORTHSIDE 777, all about one man&apos;s attempt to save a man from the chair whom he believes is totally innocent. And there too, the clue depended on a piece of evidence seen by the naked eye.\n\nEastwood&apos;s acting and direction is above reproach--he&apos;s fine and totally in control in both departments. In fact, all the supporting roles are extremely well played. Well worth viewing--and has something to say about race relations too.",

    "summary": "Reviewers say 'Culpa Mía' delves into forbidden love, family dynamics, and teenage rebellion, set against wealth and privilege. Praised for lead chemistry, action sequences, and romance, it faces criticism for clichés, unrealistic plot points, and exaggerated characters. Some find it entertaining and a good time-pass, while others call it poorly constructed and cringeworthy. The film's portrayal of taboo relationships and its comparison to franchises like 'After' spark debate.",

It is Cinderella, moving from shambles to a palace, where she meets a benevolent king and a Prince Charming. It is about a girl, beating hard-core men at their own game - drift driving. It is about the bad boy with a golden heart. About Red Riding Hood, saved by Prince Charming and the Hunter from the Big Bad Wolf. And most of all, about romantic love. The film is made fairly competently, it is dynamic and there wasn&apos;t a dull moment. The lead actors wouldn&apos;t be remembered for subtlety and nuance, but they are definitely good-looking and have a palpable chemistry. Don&apos;t judge and expect too much and you can actually enjoy it.",

Sonce Sandler is way too old to play leading role, he got a new blood tool over, Adam Devine. Devine used his cheerful stupid but smart characteristic well.\n\nNina Dobrev was an eye candy.\n\nPierce Brosnan and Ellen Barkin worked well acting-wise but I don&apos;t see good chemistry. It&apos;s like watching Brosnancs friend-zone invite to a wedding party.\n\nRichard Kind and Julie Hagerty were spot on. They are so seasoned that they make you smile everytime they have screen time.\n\nThe biggest surprise and very funny act is Michael Rooker. Known as villains in most of his movies, he played bumbling FBI agent like a pro comedian. It&apos;s like he embodied Peter Seller&apos;s Pink Phanter.\n\nThe only problem is, as commonly found in a feel good comedy movie, The Out-Laws is not memorable. It&apos;s a movie you put on the cable channel again and again. If you jave Netflix subscription, watch it. If not, it&apos;s not to die for.",

      "reviewBody": "This follow-up packs a sinister and horrifying atmosphere by means of shaky camera and videotape as well as the former Spanish films titled REC 1, and 2 . Horror story plenty of suspense, restless terror and in documentary style that itself takes place from point of sight from cameraman . The action now takes place miles away from the original location and partly in broad daylight , giving the film an entirely fresh yet disturbing new reality . A couple&apos;s wedding day turns into a horrific events as some of the guests start showing signs of a strange illness . It involves a couple named Clara (Leticia Dolera) and Koldo (Diego Martin) during their wedding celebration . All their friends and family are there at the church and some are filming the wedding. Everyone can see that the couple are so in love, so happy, yet so not ready for what is going to happen while at the reception . However , the infection has contaminated the building . An the couple occupying to spend themselves the night against the zombies as they find guests have been possessed by strange demoniac forces . They are brutally attacked by psycho people ; they soon learn that people in the building have been infected by something unknown .\n\nHighly engrossing horror , this ¨splatter¨ deals with a happy couple , Clara and Koldo , who are about to be married and is set in a timeframe prior to the other two &apos;REC&apos; films . This sequel to one of the highest earning horror movies of the last years titled ¨Rec¨ is realized in similar premise to original and contains a good cast as Leticia Dolera and Diego Martin . This exciting terror picture displays horrific scenes, drama , some brief touches of humor , action, suspense, and is quite entertaining . The frightening story begins well and grows more and more until a downbeat finale . The horror moments are compactly made and fast moving . It packs tension, shocks , thrills , chills and lots of gore and blood , but the original is far superior . In a clever twist that draws together the plots of the first two movies, this third part of the saga also works as a decoder to uncover information hidden in the first two films . The movie isn&apos;t a sequel, but a parallel story to the events of ¨Rec¨ according to two scenes: when Koldo is in the control room behind him a little TV shows pictures from the first movie such as a street TV news with a sealed building, and when Tío Víctor talks to the camera about the hurt in his hand, produced after a bit of a dog apparently dead . The writers provide a well-knit plot with mystery and horror, giving full rein to Paco Plaza natural talent for the terror genre . Appropriate cinematography in documentary style by Pablo Grosso and atmospheric musical score by Mikel Salas fitted perfectly to action . The flick was finely produced by the chairman of Filmax and Castelao Productions , Julio Fernandez who along with his brother Carlos Fernandez are two successful producers and experts on Horror genre , producers of hits as ¨The machinist¨ ,¨ Fragiles¨, ¨Darkness¨, and many others. The picture was professionally directed by Paco Plaza (¨Second name¨, ¨OT¨ and &quot;Films to Keep You Awake: The Christmas Tale&quot; ) who along with by Jaume Balaguero are the main Spanish filmmakers expert on terror cinema , both of whom have realized the box-office big successes as ¨Rec 1¨ and ¨Rec 2¨ , among others . It&apos;s a standard terror and sometimes graphically gory and turns out to be an acceptable attempt to cash in the Zombie sub-genre . Rating : 6,5 Acceptable and passable sequel .\n\nThe original film was ¨Rec¨ by Jaume Balaquero and Paco Plaza ,two magnificent experts on terror genre , followed by ¨Rec 2¨ by the same directors and starred by Manuela Velasco ; subsequently an American version titled ¨Quarantine¨ by John Erik Dowdle starred by Jay Hernandez , Jennifer Carpenter , Steve Harris , being based on the Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza film . Furthermore , another film titled ¨Quarantine : the terminal¨ by John Pogue . And this third part , a prequel titled ¨Rec, Genesis¨ with similar crew and actors that leaves the door open for the final installment, the future &apos;REC 4 Apocalypse.&apos;\n\n.",

This is a kids/family film, and in that context it delivers. It certainly is not a bad film. John Travolota and Robin Williams work well together and make this film worth seeing. I hope they have a chance to collaborate again as they have good chemistry. There were some surprises in the plot, which is unusual for most kid films. This film is not going to be an academy award winner, but it certainly was not a waste of time. I expected to be bored and found myself laughing from beginning to end. I want to thank the producers for making a family film that is worth seeing. The kids loved it and when that happens they develop a loyalty to the actors and trust them to deliver again the in future. I hope that is the case.",

      "reviewBody": "It was very interesting to see a biopic focusing on icon John Lennon&apos;s early life, or shall we say teenage years, rather than his climb to fame with The Beatles. While not one of the best biopics out there, &apos;Nowhere Boy&apos; luckily is the opposite of the film&apos;s title.\n\n&apos;Nowhere Boy&apos; has its flaws. The exposition in the final act is rather clunky, and some of the drama gets over-sentimental and melodramatic, also somewhat over-heated. While Sam Taylor-Wood doesn&apos;t do a bad job directing there is a little too much of a measured approach when it could have been tighter. That it is very inaccurate wasn&apos;t as big a problem for me, biopics are not exactly known for their accuracy and many have done far worse jobs.\n\nHowever, the period is very evocatively rendered and done justice by photography that has style and grit. The music is great.\n\nThere are some thoughtful moments in the script, and there is a nice balance of moments of poignant drama and pop history. The story is often engrossing and is pretty illuminating, not really making the mistake of saying little new that we don&apos;t know already.\n\nAaron Johnson is highly credible as Lennon and more than holds his own against the more experienced actresses Kristin Scott Thomas and Anne-Marie Duff. Scott Thomas in particular is marvellous and Duff is a fine contrast.\n\nOverall, pretty good and interesting. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

If you only need a fun and simple movie, without a twistet story you need to stay focused on, then it is a fun little movie where you can just turn your brain of and enjoy it.\n\nThe story is fairly simple, sometimes even predictable, there aren&apos;t any big moments you will still remember in a few years, there is no &apos;real espionage action&quot; which you might hope for and of course you could have done more with it. And I must be honest. I myself expected something a bit different from this movie in the beginning and by the trailers. But I like what it is. I can enjoy the charackters and their interactions, I can laugh at a lot of the jokes, and I can simply sit here and enjoy the simple story, without the need to figure out what is happening and I think this is something you could need on a bad day.\n\nSo If you want a fun and little movie for your evening after a hard day or for you and your Family, this movie might be worth a Shot.",

      "reviewBody": "I have to admit having a soft spot for this film as I have for Apocalypse Now, though perhaps Coppola could never quite carry out a truly inventive directing style. His films mostly seemed somehow constrained to an unchallenging format, and avoided the complexity, surrealism or depth so often used to great ends by film directors. Coppola&apos;s films will always seem to this author to be part of that distinct class of &quot;Hollywood Films&quot;, though some are arguably &quot;really good&quot; Hollywood films.\n\nAs often the case with good films, Rumble Fish featured a fantastic collaboration of other great artists. This talent comes together to create something memorable on film which communicates, as few films have, a certain mood or feeling that is perhaps peculiar to the American midwest, especially during the 1980&apos;s. Something about the antipathy of growing up in such a vast, apathetic, culturally blank, comfortably mediocre place and attempting to go beyond it or find something in it, like punching your way out of a cardboard box only to find that things seem just as dark and empty on the outside. It should be made clear that this author also comes from that midwest and identifies with this theme, so there is some bias in this review, but this may apply to other &quot;midwestern refugees&quot; as well.\n\nFans of S.E. Hinton, on who&apos;s book the film was based and who co-wrote the screenplay, will appreciate the film, as well as fans of Tom Waits, Stuart Copeland (of the Police and little known project Klark Kent- which closely resembles the soundtrack), Mickey Rourke, or any of the (then) young, up and coming actors like Matt Dillon, Nicolas Cage and Diane Lane.\n\nRourke is at one of the peaks of his young career here, a cool rebel without a cause type, vaguely reminiscent of young Peter Fonda or James Dean- a striking character. The film has memorable scenes and lines, one of which is Dillon&apos;s character saying to the fatalistic older brother- &quot;Motorcycle Boy&quot; played by Rourke, something like- &quot;People would really follow you anywhere, why don&apos;t we do something?&quot;, to which Rourke responds- &quot;Yeah, they&apos;d probably follow me right down to the river...and jump in.&quot;\n\nSimilar scenes and numerous references to time passing away seemed to summarize the hopeless stagnation of growing up nowhere and proceeding to go nowhere. Groping in the dark for everything or anything meaningful in the context of a forgotten, lifeless irontown where even the young seem more like ghosts trying desperately to become tangible in some sense, and the middle aged are already on some other world.\n\nOther films that come to mind- James Dean films; &quot;Reckless&quot;, another Hollywood film released a year later, with Aidan Quinn (as &quot;Rourke&quot;- coincidence?), and Daryl Hannah, was semi-successful in making the occasional reference to a similar blighted steeltown theme, though overall it was spotty; &quot;Dogs in Space&quot; with Michael Hutchence of INXS was a punk classic, and had some of that &quot;nowhere with style&quot; appeal with an Australian twist; two other 1980&apos;s films the author never saw- &quot;Down by Law&quot; and &quot;Rivers Edge&quot; probably fit somewhere in here as well."

      "reviewBody": "Check out my review on my Blog at http://fameasserlufc.wordpress.com\n\nDysfunctional is definitely a word I would use to describe this film. \n\n&quot;I Give It A Year&quot; follows the trials and tribulations of a young couple who, after marrying shortly after meeting, struggle through married life for the first year of their new lives. Rafe Spall and Rose Byrne are the couple in question but as their lives take a turn away from each other and into the arms of ex-girlfriends (Anna Faris) and business colleagues (Simon Baker) everything turns to turmoil with hilarious results.\n\nAwkward is another word I would use to describe this film. Much of the comedy stems from the wrong thing being said at the wrong time in front of the wrong people. Steven Merchant&apos;s best friend role is one he plays to perfection as it&apos;s not too much of a stretch from his normal self as Ricky Gervais&apos; right-hand man. \n\nSpall is great fun in the film and has to carry a lot of the comedy himself, having a very quirky relationship with his Ex, where Byrne is a more serious person and the situations she finds herself in lend themselves more to the &quot;should she or shouldn&apos;t she&quot; question.\n\nIt&apos;s not the funniest film ever made, but it&apos;s well worth a chuckle and I can&apos;t help think that the film would have benefited more from a full cinema, rather than a 7-person screening (yes I was the odd one out). Comedy films tend to work a lot better when there&apos;s more people watching.\n\nThat being said, the first third of the film and the last third definitely have moments which are very funny and &quot;Laugh Out Loud&quot; but the middle section does seem to focus more on which way the characters will turn than the comedy aspect.\n\nWorth a watch, by maybe a DVD viewing in a year or so rather than making a special trip to see on the big screen.",

Depp certainly plays that role of reckless drug taker to perfection. Despite the lack of ***** given, there are still emotional moments towards the end which helped ram home the somewhat sombre theme throughout the film.\n\nThe supporting cast was also great. It makes me want to check out more of Zoey Deutch&apos;s work and reaffirmed just how great an actress Rosemarie DeWitt is.\n\nI felt it had a lot in common with this year&apos;s Paddleton. It also reminded me of a season of Californication. There was definitely a slight mix of Hank Moody with Frank Gallagher and John Keating here.\n\nDespite a lot of the mixed reviews, I enjoyed this for what it was. It was perhaps the kick up the bum I needed. I do have a thing for movies that look at the bigger picture of life.",

Now I like the occasional zombie movie, but I&apos;ve only read the brief description on IMDb before watching,and I personally expected something different, something a bit more original. There was no real &apos;reason&apos; the whole movie is based on Mars. You could replace Mars with an island, the infected with zombies, the bacteria with, well, a bacteria and the rescue pod with a rescue ship for example, and basically have the same movie.\n\nAll in all, if you&apos;re like me, and enjoy watching some low budget sci-fi, this is a movie I&apos;d give a try.",

Especially remarkable is the very elaborated atmosphere of this film to which contribute the pure and simple dialogues and the use of very well-made sceneries. Kurosawa&apos;s favorite actor Tatsuya Nakadai is here at his best. Although the atmosphere is very elaborated and almost perfectly historic; tension of the viewer is heightened by the simplicity of the scenes. Kurosawa leaves certain parts to the viewer&apos;s imagination rather than showing it. The movie is highly philosophical as well as emotionally touching and presents the soul of the way of samurai and Japan&apos;s old samurai system much better and more serious than countless cheap- and bad-made martial arts movies about samurai. This is a warning to all who expect fast martial arts action and blood covered katana. This film is a Kurosawa-style mixture between opulent costume- drama, a philosophic and tragic story and the sensitivity only Kurosawa has displaying Japan&apos;s traditional way-of-life.",

      "reviewBody": "I caught an advanced screening of Caught Stealing (2025) in theaters this evening. The storyline follows a California transplant living in New York who agrees to watch his neighbor&apos;s cat while the man is away caring for his sick father. Soon, a series of strangers begin showing up at his apartment, demanding to know his neighbor&apos;s whereabouts, and subjecting him to brutal beatings and torture in the process. What are they after-and can he find a way to help them before he, and everyone he knows, ends up dead?\n\nThis picture is directed by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream) and stars Austin Butler (Elvis), Zoë Kravitz (The Batman), Matt Smith (House of the Dragon), Liev Schreiber (Scream), and Regina King (The Harder They Fall).\n\nThe story is clever and unpredictable, often feeling like a Guy Ritchie crime caper-but rooted deeply in a gritty, authentic New York setting. The cast delivers elite performances, and the plot is packed with sharp twists and turns. The cinematography and camera angles are equally impressive, enhancing the tension and style throughout.\n\nThe action is top-tier: abrupt fight scenes, thrilling car chases, sudden bursts of gore, and intense shootouts that all land with impact. Even the subplots, particularly those tied to the chases and crashes, are smartly executed. The ending is immensely satisfying, and the soundtrack is brilliant.\n\nIn conclusion, Caught Stealing isn&apos;t perfect, but it&apos;s an unpredictable and worthwhile rollercoaster of violence, intensity, and action. I&apos;d score it a strong 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.",

I had to first read some of the critic reviews to see if their reactions were like mine. They were to a large degree. The problem lies with the premise that such bad parents as the Walls, can somehow at movies end have a happy face put on it. Make no mistake, this is an unpleasant movie featuring first rate actors trying to make a flawed screen adaptation work. Ella Anderson is the star of the movie, but Woody Harrelson plays such a bad dad, it is hard to buy into the sympathetic ending. Brie Larson is good but her playing the adult Jeanette Walls is the less interesting part of the story.",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Tom-Yum-Goong",
      "reviewBody": "After having watched Tony Jaa in Ong Bak about a week ago on TV, I was waiting for the day when Tom-Yum-Goog finally made its way here. There was a film in between these two, called The Bodyguard, which wasn&apos;t released in the theatres here, so I guess I gotta hit the shops to look for it.\n\nMy friend has likened the introduction of Tom-Yum-Goong to watching National Geographic, and he&apos;s right. It&apos;s an idyllic Thai village scene where Kham (Tony Jaa) grows up and bonds together with herds of elephants, and it might even looked as if it came right out of Kipling&apos;s The Jungle Book.\n\nIt&apos;s a picture of calm before the storm, and the first 10 minutes set the scene, as the elephants will play an important aspect in this movie as it gets elevated into mythical status (check out the CGI scene, looks like Jackie Chan&apos;s The Myth, with its historical fights). You&apos;ll know right away that this is a Thai movie, with its excellent fusion of Thai elements into the storyline - the elephants, the rivers, the rituals, Buddhism, &quot;Tom-Yum-Goong&quot;, and of course, Muay Thai.\n\nWith elephants, the natural baddies are first and foremost, the poachers, who kidnap our hero&apos;s pets (wrong move). Of course these baddies belong to a larger crime family and syndicate operating out of Sydney, Australia, which deals with drugs, human and animal trafficking, prostitution, all with the blessings of corrupt cops, and led by a transvestite (yes, you heard me right).\n\nTom-Yum-Goong may refer to a shrimp dish in Thailand, but in this movie, it refers to a restaurant which serves as a front for illegal activities. Action fans need not wait too long for Tony Jaa action, as he plunges head on into fights with the Thai gangsters first, in their bungalow hideout. And that&apos;s just to whet your appetite for more mayhem! Bridging the fights from Thailand to Australia is a short boat chase scene that looked right out from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, but that&apos;s the only weak action sequence in Tom-Yum-Goong.\n\nThere are plenty of fights in Sydney to keep all action fans happy - like the massive battle with the Aussie streetgangs (on roller blades and bikes) in an abandoned warehouse, which also showcased Jaa&apos;s agility and acrobatic ability. I thought that somehow the cinematography during this sequence let Jaa down at times, especially when he weaved in and out of the trains, the camera just couldn&apos;t keep up, and was positioned at a bad angle.\n\nBut that aside, it made up for itself in a beautifully filmed, one-motion tracking shot of Jaa making his way through a four-storey restaurant, kicking major rear, without seemingly any cuts (I said seemingly, as there was a part where water droplets stained the camera, but somehow disappeared abruptly). Doom has its gimmicky first-person shooter perspective, this one here has its classic third-person perspective, as if you&apos;re controlling Jaa in a coin-operated fight console, taking on the baddies with various swift moves.\n\nIf you&apos;ve known by now, I kinda likened Jaa&apos;s movies so far to Bruce Lee&apos;s (some see shades of Matrix in this movie), and there was another action sequence in which Jaa was up against hordes of gangsters in an enclosed room (think Lee in the Japanese dojo in Fists of Fury), and he floored them all with bone-crushing, limb-breaking kicks and punches. Move aside Steven Seagal, Jaa&apos;s doing it faster, and more lethal! The fights with the huge wrestlers too was a highlight (ala Lee in Game of Death with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), as was the final fight with the final &quot;boss&quot;.\n\nPerhaps my favourite in the movie is the scene at the temple. Water, Fire, and a looming Buddha, Jaa takes on three distinct exponents one-on-one - the hip hop breakdancer, the Chinese wushu sword expert, and the Western wrestler. While this movie has done away with Ong-Bak&apos;s repetitive sequences (yes, we know what Jaa is capable of already), the slow-mo in this particular set is pure poetry in motion. It&apos;s different from Ong-Bak, in that Jaa, like Lee in Enter The Dragon, gets beaten up and injured. You can inflict pain and injure Jaa, but like Lee, he bounces back with a vengeance, sans shirt too.\n\nJaa has let his action do the talking instead of his acting abilities (no stunt double, no wire-work, no special effects), and I have no qualms with that, given after all, this is an out and out action movie. Petchtai Wongkamlao, who plays Inspector Mark, and has been featured in all of Jaa&apos;s movies, returns to add his comedic touch to the film as a Thai-immigrant policeman in Sydney, and fans of Ong Bak will also be pleased that this movie is helmed by the same director Prachya Pinkaew.\n\nWhile Hollywood struggles to find worthy successors to its 80s and 90s action heroes like Stallone, Van Damme, and Schwarzeneggar, Asia has already found one to takeover the mantle from Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jet Li (as the latter two seemed to have drifted and indicated a preference for dramas). He&apos;s Thai, and his name is Tony Jaa. You heard it here first, he&apos;s gonna be setting the bar for action movies to come. He can only get better, and I&apos;m already a huge fan!",

It&apos;s also amazing to think this was Derek Luke&apos;s first movie. Joy Bryant is gorgeous Viola Davis has a small but stand out role, as does Verne&apos;s Watson, who I always like to see, and Kevin Connelly from John Q is here, too.\n\nFor his first effort, Denzel does an amazing job, as does all of the actors. Everyone should watch this movie. I&apos;m not going to lie, I teared up at the end, even though I knew where it was going.\n\nDisappointingly Antwone Fisher only grossed $21 million at the domestic box office and was the first Denzel Washington movie not to finish in the 100 highest grossing movie of the year, since Mississippi Masala in 1991.",

The government gave him a raw deal . Nobody gives him a raw deal. Nobody gives him a Raw Deal . His trigger has all the answers. The system gave him a raw dea l. Nobody gives him a raw deal.\n\nThiis is a predictable , run-of-the-mill thriller , even formulaic , but the usual formula works , at times . Arnie as an ex raw deal infitrated agent is nice and , of course , he shoots lots of people , as our hero will eventually take a machine-gun and mow down the entire syndicate of bad guys just like Charles Bronson and Chuck Norris . Violence , profanity , sex , grisly killings and bloodshed ensue here and there , that&apos;s why it&apos;s rated R . Main and support cast are pretty well , as Arnold Schwarzenegger is well accompanied by a good cast , such as :Darren McGavin , Kathryn Harrold , Sam Wanamaker , Paul Shenar , Blanche Baker , Robert Davi , Ed Lauter and Joe Regalbuto.\n\nIt displays an adequate cinematogrphy by director of photography Alex Thomson , shot in Chicago city . As well as atmospheric musical score composed y means of synthesizer by Boardman .The motion picture was professionally directed by John Irvin who managed to stage some excellent action scenes , stunning scenarios and clever edition. Irvin has made some thrilling action and wartime movies such as : Dogs of war , Hamburger Hill, When Trumpets Fade , The Fourth Angel , Freefall , Shinner , Next of kin , Robin Hood , City of industry , among others. Rating : 6/10. Acceptable and passable . An Arnold typical vehicle that will appeal to his fans . Worthwhile seeing .",

      "reviewBody": "Another poster had the following heading for their review of &quot;Private Parts&quot;:\n\nA self-serving and unrealistic look at a funny man\n\nAnd I totally agree.  I like Howard Stern.  I don&apos;t love or idolize him like many of his fans do but I think he fills a necessary niche for people.\n\nBut this movie reeked of self promotion and an attempt to win over people (mostly women) who didn&apos;t or don&apos;t like him.  This was confirmed when my wife (who hated Stern) turned to me after the movie was over and said &quot;he&apos;s so nice...I liked it!&quot;  Oye.  The kiss of death.\n\nThis movie was a big hit in it&apos;s opening weekend but quickly fizzled out.  I know why.  His true, core fans flocked to see it the first weekend and were put off by it&apos;s &quot;nice&quot; moments (all the cuddly stuff with his wife and kids...the sorrowful, thoughtful look he gets before he hits it big..etc.) This movie is NOT what hardcore Stern fans want or were looking for.  Oh, yes...there&apos;s the nudity and the &quot;naughty&quot; Stern behavior.  But for some reason, despite some of it being taken directly from the original airings, these scenes have a cleaned/scrubbed feeling to it which zaps them of their spark, fun and originality.  The scenes are simply NOT funny, daring or in the slightest way dirty or daring.  It does not push the envelope at all.\n\nAfter the opening weekend, most non Stern fans would not go near it because they feared (incorrectly) that the movie was near pornographic and anarchic. So the film fell into a void between the (disappointed )hardcore Stern fans and the non fans.\n\nWhat the film could&apos;ve been is something along the lines of a Monty Python film.  It needed an edge or some zippy editing to move it along.\n\nWhat&apos;s amazing about the film is how completely, shockingly CONVENTIONAL it is."

On the other hand, fragile feelings, ponderings and internal doubts are very difficult to express on the screen - without losing the pace and uniformity of the plot. It is also pity that Prague was not / could not been used, as it is a beautiful city and gives more realism than the French places used. Depicion of the socialist/communist oppression is, however, rather perfunctory, seeming not so serious as it really was in the 1970ies within the Warsaw block when hopes of intellectuals for the so-called human-faced socialism vanished as liberal steps were diminished or repealed.\n\nThe cast is, of course, brilliant, in particular the bohemian ménage à trois members: Daniel Day-Lewis as Tomas, Juliette Binoche as Tereza and Lena Olin as Sabina - all later multiple Academy Award winners and/or nominees, and from different European countries (the movie itself is still the US one). They and some other fine European actors have provided the movie a real European atmosphere, without a Hollywood studio feeling as sometimes perceived in &quot;older&quot; movies.\n\nNevertheless, The Unbearable Lightness of Being is still a movie high above average, enhancing historical facts as well. But it is hard to say whether is is recommendable to read the book before or after...",

      "reviewBody": "Face it, the majority of viewers were Jonas Brother fans. Nothing wrong with that at all, in fact, it was probably the movie&apos;s selling point.\n\nHowever... The script was poorly written. Unrealistic moments and scenes are embedded throughout the movie, Camp Rock sitting at the top of them all. The plot was VERY predictable, and lines seemed forced and very, well. PLOTTED. haha. The Jonas Brothers made their appearance, as promised, but don&apos;t expect any acting close to Zac Efron&apos;s or Shia LaBeouf&apos;s. Joe Jonas, playing the main protagonist, is not meant to be an actor. His voice is mediocre and sounds nicer with backup vocals and guitar. Nick Jonas seemed robotic (why were his swim trunks so short?) but Kevin Jonas played a pleasing and likable airhead. \n\nLindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff and Shia LaBeouf have left Disney. Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens are on the way out. Disney has come to realize that they can&apos;t keep depending on the JoBros and Hannah/Miley Cyrus to reel in the cash. So, they introduced a new, but not-as-cute as Hilary Duff face: Demi Lovato. Okay, she&apos;s not edgy and charismatic like La Lohan, not NEARLY as exotic as Hudgens, and not as experienced and cheeky as Cyrus, but hey! She did okay. Her voice is good enough to be unforgotten, but also be hard to remember. I&apos;m happy they didn&apos;t use her best friend, Selena Gomez, who is another tool in Disney&apos;s attempts to recreate lovable shows that don&apos;t come close to Lizzie McGuire or Even Stevens.\n\nAnyways, the music&apos;s simple, sounds familiar, but is fairly pleasing. The acting (including MORE not as talented faces)is mediocre and slightly painful at times. (Excluding Alyson Stoner, who was probably the best) I don&apos;t recommend watching the movie more than twice, because by then, you&apos;ll know each line, each verse, and each forced laugh, and fake diss. This doesn&apos;t rock completely, but it&apos;s not so disappointing either. :)",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Assignment: Miami Beach&quot; is the first one in the franchise that doesn&apos;t have Steve Guttenberg, and I&apos;ve got mixed feelings about that. In one way it&apos;s sort of a blessing, because we can finally spend some quality time with Lassard in this one. George Gaynes has always been the best actor of any installment&apos;s cast, so it&apos;s nice to see a sequel where everything revolves around him. Granted, all he really gets to do is have people fall over a bunch of times, but somehow he still makes it work. On the other hand, the movie clearly misses a decent &quot;straight man&quot; to counterbalance all the oddballs. I guess that was new guy Matt McCoy&apos;s task, but given that the guy has no screen presence whatsoever and barely made the final cut it doesn&apos;t quite work. Overall though, I didn&apos;t hate this. I mean, they do the same seven or eight bits they do in all the other ones, but here they do them on a different location! Michael Winslow does his Bruce Lee schtick for the fifth time in five movies, but now on a different location! I was sorta surprised Miami didn&apos;t have a Blue Oyster Bar, to be honest. &quot;Police Academy 5&quot; is not the greatest movie you&apos;ll ever see, but it&apos;ll give you about what you would expect.",

      "reviewBody": "I was lucky enough to bag a ticket to the one off showing of Peter Jackson&apos;s They Shall Not Grow Old, having watched a lot of World War One documentaries and made countless visits to historic sites across France and Belgium I was keen to see what was being marketed as a &apos;new&apos; perspective on The Great War, it did not disappoint.   Jackson chose to create a narrow focus narrative for this 1 hour 30 minute documentary to allow the viewer to delve into the fine details often missed in more sweeping documentaries trying to cover all aspects and areas of the conflict. Jackson chose to look closely at the lives and experiences of British native frontline troops in Belgium. The documentary follows a linear timeline beginning with the breakout of war and the initial volunteering of thousands of young men excited and ready for an adventure for King and Country and ends with the great sense of loss and uncertainty of the future the troops had by the end of the war.   The entire documentary is narrated by records of surviving troops recorded in the 60s and 70s, this was an intentional move by Jackson that definitely adds to the ability for the viewer to connect and relate to the survivors.   I especially found the stories and anecdotes about the goings on behind the lines during down time and R&amp;R for the troops captivating as it is often over looked in other documentaries solely concentrating on the combat and horrors of war.   The pain staking effort and lengths Jackson and his team went to to restore this footage not only with colour but with frame rate, sharpness and especially sound is breath taking. Taking the time to have professional lip readers painstakingly review all the footage so allow us to then know and hear what was being said truly brought the footage to life.   My only issue with the film, something that is made note of by Jackson is of course because of the time in history and available cameras there is no actual combat footage available so you do spend a large amount of time just watching still hand drawn cartoons of the battles from the time, something that cannot be avoided but does detract from the immersion the rest of the film creates.  I highly recommend this film to everyone, it is important we see the true perspective of what our ancestors went through and never forget these brave men and women.",

The result is an interesting film, which is often confusing and frustrating. I&apos;m sure that this was not entirely accidental and that the filmmakers wanted to keep the audience in a state of disorientation.  Nevertheless, the convolutions of the story appear to serve no other purpose than to keep us off balance.\n\nThe films biggest sin is the scene in the middle of the film where the daughter Luna opens the bedroom door.  The following event is presented in such a way that we are left guessing as to what has just happened. There&apos;s no reason for withholding it, except the misguided idea that lack of clarity is artistically valuable. I think that despite it&apos;s flaws, this film shows a great vibrancy and energy.\n\nPeople talk a lot about the sex scenes. The film doesn&apos;t have much to say about sex and it certainly isn&apos;t about sex. Nevertheless, the scenes do not seem tacked on for the sake of it and, in an era when Hollywood seems to be gripped by a new puritanism, it&apos;s refreshing to see a frank depiction of what is, after all, an important aspect of the relationship between these characters."

But when one of her clients dies due to heart attack during an encounter, she leaves &amp; quits prostitution but is later tracked down by the police who reveals Isabelle&apos;s double life to her parents.\n\nI don&apos;t really know what to make of this film. The filmmaker&apos;s intention is not as clear as it should be nor clear is the motives of its characters plus the subplots are very fragmented &amp; scattered all over the place. The characters are rather uninteresting &amp; Isabelle clearly is a confused teenager who&apos;s not aware of the consequences of the path she has chosen. Yet, Marine Vacth gives her all to deliver a sensual performance that could&apos;ve been much rewarding if the character was more fleshed out in the script.\n\nCinematography, however, exquisitely captures the beautiful location this film is shot at &amp; the quote &quot;once a whore, always a whore&quot; is strongly implied but the drama remains stale as a whole. On an overall scale, Jeune &amp; Jolie is that cinema which had the opportunity to become something truly intriguing &amp; rewarding at the same time but apart from the plethora of sex scenes it offers from start to finish, it lacks everything a cinema needs to stimulate its audience."

They&apos;re fired but for some reason he still has an active expense account credit card and they party that night. He also meets the pretty Emma.\n\nThe next day, Wyatt wants to meet with Cassidy. He will get him a job with his childhood competitor Goddard so that he can steal Goddard&apos;s next big idea. He&apos;s got a behavioral specialist on board and sets Cassidy up with the good life and trains him. Cassidy gets the job and Goddard is impressed with his idea. And as it turns out Emma also works for Goddard. Everything is going fine until Wyatt&apos;s people become more pushy and want him to steal the future device from Goddard&apos;s corporate vault. Of course he&apos;s caught and with that Goddard wants to buy Wyatt&apos;s company or put him in jail, but Cassidy has some plans of his own.\n\nParanoia has a lot going for a it- a decent budget, impressive cast, an OK story, good visuals. It even starts with some important discussion about how America has completely ceased being the country of opportunity it once was. The direction is poor and the script could have used some work. The movie&apos;s title is wrong or if they intended to highlight the moment of Cassidy&apos;s paranoia they failed. As a whole, emotionally, this movie is pretty flat. There should be a far greater sense of dread and danger. Perhaps it&apos;s because they went with a PG-13 rating. As an R-rated movie this could have been better. I get the sense that they aimed for a mature teen audience looking for a serious movie. And perhaps it would work for that crowd- not sure. Paranoia had a lot of potential. I wanted to like this movie as the cast does a good job, except for Oldman&apos;s and Davidtz&apos;s obnoxious British accent. But the director did his best and succeeded at frustrating the audience and not giving us as good a movie as it should have been.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Noah Baumbach wrote and directed the excellent &quot;The Squid and the Whale&quot;, and it is with &quot;Greenberg&quot; that he really makes a statement as an independent filmmaker to anticipate. The second gem is always the most elusive. That said, I am not sure I can recommend this movie to very many people, despite all the good things I am about to write.\n\nThis is the first Ben Stiller role that actually seems to fit him. His typical role is as a punchline. Here, he plays a guy who recently suffered a nervous breakdown and is now house-sitting for his rich brother, whose family is vacationing in Vietnam. Throughout the movie, Greenberg states he is concentrating on doing &quot;nothing&quot; right now. Of course, that is his defense mechanism for being unable to connect or communicate with any real person. Yes, that sounds bleak ... and it is. Yet, it is also fascinating and thought-provoking.\n\nDespite Stiller&apos;s strong turn, Greta Gerwig (as Florence) proves to be the heart of the story. She is the family assistant to Greenberg&apos;s brother and finds herself oddly attracted to Greenberg&apos;s vulnerable state. This is my first exposure to Ms. Gerwig and I find her fascinating as an actress. She has a natural openness on screen and is certainly no glamour-gal. Instead she comes across as a very real 25 year old trying to make sense of life - especially her own.\n\nIn addition to Ms. Gerwig, Rhys Ifans provides outstanding support work as Greenberg&apos;s long ago band mate. This is the polar opposite of Ifan&apos;s character in &quot;The Boat that Rocked&quot; as here is just a guy putting together a grown up life for himself. He struggles with the adjustment, but accurately depicts how choices can make or break us.\n\nI am not sure whether to categorize this as a character study or just an exquisitely written series of scenes that hit the nail on the head. One of the best scenes of the film is when Stiller meets up with Jennifer Jason Leigh and she immediately rebuffs his reconciliation attempts. They had been a couple briefly 15 years ago and she has obviously moved on. Excellent film-making.\n\nThe best way I can describe Greenberg the character is that he is a compilation of the dark thought that we all experience from time to time ... a desire to do nothing, wanting to be blunt and direct, dreams of recapturing the magic of youth, and of course, writing complaint letters for everything wrong in the world. Obviously, most of us spend very little real time on these things, but that is the Greenberg character. Let&apos;s keep an eye on Mr. Baumbach - he may just be the real deal.",

One of the best shots in this movie is at the beginning, when Wesley Snipes&apos; character is walking AWAY from the camera. I wish *I* looked that good.\n\nI suppose there was a kind of freedom in making this movie, for them, because they were not playing a character that looks like them in *real life*.

      "reviewBody": "Lush, epic, sweeping, entrancing.  It&apos;s all here. If there&apos;s any &quot;justice&quot; in Hollywood, this one should be Oscar bait for at least cinematography, costuming, musical score and the magnum-magnificent presence of some dude I never heard of before I saw AATK -- Chow Yun Fat.  Now, I have been informed that he is the Coolest Actor in the World (according to L.A. Times).  I can see this dark, cool elegance in his breathtaking performance as a real and fascinating historic figure, King Mongkut, who in actuality learned Latin, astronomy and memorized major parts of both Bible and Koran while a Buddhist monk.  Contrary to the buffoonery of Yul Brynner&apos;s overblown portrayal, Chow opens for us an entirely new cultural door, brushing for the eager audience a portrait of a monarch of absolutely power who wields it so well that he is unafraid of gentleness, hugging his enchanting, on-screen children without reserve and finding himself mystifyingly in love with a foreign woman he cannot tame or bed because of the constraint of the times. The betrayal, revolution and barbarity of l9th century Thailand (Siam) become pale watercolor in comparison to the bold red and orange of unresolved love and religious and cultural interplay represented by Foster and Chow. We fear that more of these mesmerizing moments between the two lie on the editing room floor.  However, Chow&apos;s sensitive face and body language reflect this inner evolution and bittersweet turmoil far better than does Jodie Foster&apos;s rather wooden performance accompanied by a troubling British accent. I respect Foster&apos;s talent immensely, though it shone through only intermittently, blossoming only when she softens to the King&apos;s patient (sometimes stormy) friendship.  The indelible etching of the film comes during a non-speaking sequence involving the disposition of Tuptim and Balat which sub-plot likely was originally meant to be a subtle reflection of the untenable love affair between Anna and Mongkut. This is so well-edited and scored that it&apos;s going to be hard to forget. When the King kneels in agonized prayer before his talismanic Emerald Buddha, one is compelled to conclude that he is in anguish -- not only over what&apos;s happening to his concubine and his throne -- but the fact that his actions necessitated by politics will also probably forever separate him from his tea-tray-tossing Anna and all she believes in and has worked for in his country.  Okay, so I cried in several places (something I nearly never do) -- the mark of a film which has accomplished its goal, i.e., the moving of hearts. I was fascinated with this movie. It made me read and research a part of the world I&apos;ve generally ignored, and whole new palace gates have opened. Sumptuous and rich it is; and award-winning it should be, but the sun-star opulence of this new guy, Chow, is the stellar pin on that film curtain. Thanks, Mr. Tennant. And thank you, Mr. Chow."

      "reviewBody": "The Forgotten Battle may not be the most memorable war movie ever made, but it is a solid Dutch war drama worth checking out. The aim of this film is to tell the true story of the lessor known Battle of the Scheldt. Visually, this movie is quite impressive. The cinematography beautifully displays an interesting landscape for us. The battle sequences are especially impressive and realistic. They are violent, graphic and expertly shot. It is very much like Saving Private Ryan in that aspect. But there is a lot more going on in this movie than just battle action.\n\nEarly on, we&apos;re introduced to 3 different characters who&apos;s stories we follow. Eventually, they all cross paths, but perhaps not as satisfyingly as one might have hoped. The acting is stellar, although the weakness of this movie is that all the characters feel like supporting acts as the central focus of the movie is the mission of liberating Zeeland in the Netherlands. But it truly is an interesting historical event and story to witness in this format. This battle, as well as this movie, should not be overlooked.",

      "reviewBody": "I found this film by chance, without having heard anything about it, so I went in with no expectations. But I love me a good apocalyptic flick, even though most are very predictable. This one is not predictable. And even though the setting is after the apocalypse, the story is really about human nature, a la Lord of the Flies. \n\nThe peoples reactions to the events, and to each other, are extreme, yet believable. The acting is very good, among the best i&apos;ve seen lately in a sci-fi picture. Yet it was the writing that truly took me in. The story is paced very evenly, and proceeds towards it&apos;s inevitable conclusion without pause or remorse. \n\nI have to say that this movie is not for children or even most adults. There are strong elements of violence and sexuality that are far beyond what most people can stomach. With this in mind, however, I found the psychological elements to be far more disturbing than the graphic scenes. We don&apos;t like to think that people are capable of certain things, but in extreme conditions people can be pushed to do the unimaginable.\n\nThis is the the important point of the film, rather than the storyline, or &quot;how the world ends&quot;. It&apos;s about how we can self destruct, as individuals. \n\nWhile I will be disturbed by the imagery for a few days, I really still loved this movie, and recommend it to anyone with a strong stomach.",

I saw the unrated version and only jumped when someone knocked on my window. So if you are in for something to keep you out of your seat rent &apos;Scream.&apos;\n\nBut I liked it because I enjoy gore. It makes the first fifteen minutes of &apos;Scream&apos; become tame.

      "reviewBody": "I saw the trailers for Jimmy Neutron and was not at all impressed. The premise sounded way too kiddy and the fact that it was going to be a TV show made the whole thing scream, &quot;Marketing!&quot; Thankfully I just caught it on video and was wonderfully surprised. The animation is very good and nicely detailed, the humor is simple and G-rated for kids, which will please adults, and the story is fast-paced and creative. I liked all of the characters, from the whipped-cream hair sporting Jimmy to his nerdy friends and the evil booger aliens. There were some genuinely cool touches too, like the fight between a tiny teacher and the deadly apple worm or the detailed alien chicken. My only real complaint is the fact that the soundtrack is packed to the brim with dumb pop songs that pop up at the weirdest times and basically interrupt the flow of the whole movie. Also, any movie with Aaron Carter singing in it quickly gets a few points demoted from it.  You can stick around after the video&apos;s credits for some music videos, one with the C arter kid and another with some girls singing &quot;We&apos;re the Kids In America.&quot; They are not spectacular extras, which makes me yearn for a DVD player even more, now. All in all, though, Jimmy is a pleasant, short flick that won&apos;t keep adults in a coma and will definitely get the kids quiet for an hour. It may not be up there with the Pixar films or Shrek, but it is decent nonetheless. 3/4 stars."

Yes, I understand given the notion of authority, people will listen to what they are told, but these people act like they have never heard of due process of law, innocent until proved guilty, asking for an attorney to be present or even asking for a policeman&apos;s badge number when he demands strange things. Only at a fast food restaurant, staffed by the most uneducated idiots could something like this occur. Or rather, I would like to think so. It seems as if the caller banks of what the people may have seen in TV shows to get them to follow his orders, but likewise, wouldn&apos;t TV at least remind people that officers don&apos;t strip search and spank people over like 40 missing dollars? The moral of the story is to stay in school and know your rights. Or you might wind up like these morons someday.",

      "reviewBody": "The loser and lonely waitress Agnes (Ashley Judd) lives in a cheap motel in Okalahoma grieving the disappearance of her beloved son Lloyd ten years ago. Her abusive ex-husband Jerry Goss (Harry Connick Jr.) has just left prison on probation and is insistently calling her. When her colleague and only friend, the lesbian RC (Lynn Collins), brings her drifter acquaintance Peter Evans (Michael Shannon) to visit her, they have an affair and Peter stays with Agnes in her room. Peter finds bugs in their bed, and discloses to Agnes that he was a soldier in the Gulf War submitted to experiments by the army and presently he is infested with bugs. Agnes feels the same symptoms and the couple believes in Peter&apos;s conspiracy theory of the American government.\n\n&quot;Bug&quot; is a weird low-budget movie, set practically in one location, about paranoia and schizophrenia. The unpleasant story is very well acted, and Ashley Judd surprised me with a great interpretation of a lonely woman with a tragedy behind that feels attracted by a gentle man with delusional paranoia and schizophrenia tendency brilliantly performed by Michael Shannon. This movie is not bad, but it is absolutely predictable; I was disappointed since I expected a surprising twist in the end that never happens. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Possuídos&quot; (&quot;Possessed&quot;)",

The movie is about glam rock as a musical and a social movement, as an attitude, but the general tone is closer to an elegy than to a defense without actually being neither.\n\nI liked the movie, though, specially Ewan McGregor and the performances by bands highly influenced by glam rock.",

I liked the characters and actors&apos; performances. There is a bit of a morale in the movie, so I think I may rewatch it with my son. This was an easy watch, light, humorous, and entertaining.

They must be evil and need to be locked away as they are clearly not the same as you and me are they? Well what if they were the same, only they had a moment of madness, a moment that they did without thinking when they were young enough to know it was wrong but not too fully realise the full extent of their actions? This film does what all great films do, it educates and opens your eyes and mind to new on suggestions, in a sense it widens your experiences. If you really let it this film will get into your head and cause you to fight with your preconceived ideas on punishment for people or whether they deserve forgiveness.\n\nThis is a great film, I really liked it but I felt uncomfortable during most of it because I knew deep down it was just asking me a question. I know what the lead character did is wrong, I know he was a child when he did it, but now you see him in a new life, touching other people&apos;s lives. The film does have an ending for you but this is not the point of the film. The really ending is in your head and it stays with you, &quot;are you are willing to forgive someone like Jack?&quot;",

Practical effects and sound design are lauded, while the creature design divides opinions. Christopher Abbott's performance is praised, but Julia Garner's role is criticized as underutilized.

      "reviewBody": "Let me start by saying that Christopher Abbott&apos;s performance was splendid. He stepped into this role with ease, and I would recommend this film based solely on his interpretation of the titular character.\n\nThat said, there were many things in this film that failed to work for me. Addressing Julia Garner&apos;s performance, I must say I think she is a lovely actress. In fact, she tends to steal any scenes she&apos;s in when it comes to most of her other work that I&apos;ve seen. In Wolf Man, however, she is less than believable in the role of wife and mother, and, along with a lack of depth in the script, I found myself less than concerned about the fate of the family.\n\nI was especially excited to see this movie after hearing it was being written/directed by Leigh Whannell, whose work on The Invisible Man was impeccable. Wolf Man fails where The Invisible Man succeeds in the way of character development and raw emotion. When it comes to the world of fantastical creatures like vampires, werewolves, zombies, etc., I think there should be a clear direction chosen between campy/outrageous and dark/serious when telling such stories. While Whannell seems to have chosen the latter, I felt the film was too tame to affect an audience and too surface-level to reach the heart.",

If this was directed by John McTiernan as originally planned, this would have been a great movie. Sadly, instead we got the guy who did Daredevil and he once again delivered a bland, uninspiring product. Acting is OK, Travolta did his best to hold a consistent accent (it was the wrong accent, but hey!) throughout the movie, while DeNiro looked more like he was only concerned with the paycheck.\n\nAll in all, the movie is not terrible, I guess it wouldn&apos;t kill you to watch it if you have nothing better to do for an hour and a half. The sad part is that this could have been a much, much better movie, perhaps even a classic.",

OK, perhaps some scenes were too cushy and sentimental, but the laugh to running-time ratio is surprisingly high. This may be branded as a chick-flick but there&apos;s comedy here for everyone. The film is basically a combination of different styles of wit from the six main stars and the result is surprisingly good.\n\n Hugh Grant does his usual high class, bumbling gentleman thing, Tom Arnold does his annoying best-friend neighbour routine, Jeff Goldblum as the decidedly cynical artist with a skeptical view of everything, Joan Cusack as the kooky ditz, Robin Williams as the inept foreign doctor and Julianne Moore plays it straight. There&apos;s also a great mix of verbal and slapstick wit that doesn&apos;t go un-noticed (the preying mantis joke is a laugh-riot).\n\n For the most part, &quot;Nine Months&quot; is a welcome change from your usual fluffy, smiley rom-com. I have absolutely no idea why people don&apos;t like the movie because I think it&apos;s great. My IMDb rating: 7.2/10."

Jacky Chan is good in this. Turning ladder.. umbrella into a very nice sparing choreography. Well i guess this is Weng Chun. I also noticed the master has taken more blows and more injuries from the opponents in a fair manner. Also the aging Ip Man portraiting the pain and the wobbling arms really convincing that getting old is the main factor to end 10years legendary saga in making of these 4 films. As for Bruce, you deserves a 5 by 5 my man. It so happened that this is not your tales to tell Bruce, otherwise you may steal all the sparks and spangles from ypur master. The ending in my opinion could have skipped. Could have done in written captions for a complete finale closure. Overall I like this one and deserve my 8/10.",

      "name": "Jennifer Aniston achieves the best performance of her career in Daniel Barnz&apos;s emotional drama...",
      "reviewBody": "Every once in a while, and admittedly not often enough, an actor or  actress opens your eyes to talents you weren&apos;t aware they inhabited.  Over the past few decades, I think of performers like Charlize Theron  in &quot;Monster&quot; or Halle Berry in &quot;Monster&apos;s Ball&quot; as prime examples.  Joining the elite list is the beautiful and incredible Jennifer Aniston  in Daniel Barnz&apos;s &quot;Cake&quot; co-starring Academy Award nominee Adriana  Barraza. In a turn that stands as the single best performance by an  actress this year, Aniston offers her heart and soul in the role of her  career.  &quot;Cake&quot; tells the story of Claire Simmons, a woman addicted to pain  killers who begins to hallucinate and see visions of Nina (Anna  Kendrick), a woman who commits suicide from her chronic pain support  group. Not so long after, she starts a friendship with Nina&apos;s husband  Roy (Sam Worthington), all while worrying the heart of her angelic  housekeeper Silvana (Barraza).  Screenwriter Patrick Tobin, a relatively unknown scribe whose only  credit is &quot;No Easy Way&quot; nearly twenty years ago, gives a strong focus  on the creation of Claire. In partnership with Aniston&apos;s talent, Claire  comes off like the female equivalent to Melvin from &quot;As Good as it  Gets.&quot; Snippy, darkly funny at times, but mostly emotionally driven by  an aching pain. Tobin&apos;s work on character creation is top-notch  however, with his ability to move the story along fluidly, there&apos;s  still some work to be done. When we dig into the people that surround  Claire, it&apos;s only Silvana that doesn&apos;t feel like a clichéd  representation of every sappy independent movie you&apos;ve seen over the  years. Director Daniel Barnz has a confident hand on the material and  does his very best to elevate the script&apos;s flaws. With huge misfires  like &quot;Won&apos;t Back Down&quot; and &quot;Beastly&quot; under his belt, he finally shows  what some of his aesthetic beats can create with the right material.  The movie has many interesting questions, some of which feel satisfying  and comfortable to ask, other things however feel so small scale that  the film itself can&apos;t keep up with it.  The film lives and breathes, succeeds and soars, and stands tall by the  work of Jennifer Aniston. I&apos;ve liked Aniston since &quot;Friends,&quot; my single  favorite sitcom of all-time but her film choices have left much to be  desired. I never knew that Aniston could dig so deep. I pray to the  movie Gods that this is not a one-trick pony for her career. Aniston  allows herself to be submerged, and overtaken by all the things that  plague Claire&apos;s life. A single scene involving a large wall picture  will bring many to tears.  Adriana Barraza is nearly just as effective as Aniston in a role that  will hopefully remind Hollywood that they are not tapping into one of  the finest actresses working today. An emotional pillar to the story,  Silvana&apos;s heart is worn on her sleeve, weaving in and out of Spanish,  and presenting brilliant chemistry with Aniston. Sam Worthington  continues to try to find his place in Hollywood. Subtle but emotionally  distant for anyone to relish. Surprisingly moving, though brief is  Chris Messina as Jason. He&apos;s a role or two away from having THE role  that propels him to stardom. Anna Kendrick is haunting in a performance  that beckons and calls for a change of pace for the actress. Felicity  Huffman and William H. Macy are effective in brief, underwritten roles.  We also get a final look at the late Misty Upham, which is tragic on  its own.  Overall, &quot;Cake&quot; hits the center of grief and loss just good enough to  warrant a positive reaction. Jennifer Aniston&apos;s performance is  something that most actresses will pray to be able to achieve, but  never come close. An effortless turn that doesn&apos;t fade in the distance  or crumble under the cloud of a faulty script. She excels in a  performance that demands respect from her peers, and movie- goers  everywhere.",

      "reviewBody": "From the very beginning, this movie will try to buy you out with its lavish sets, costumes and visual effects but as it proceeds futher it only seems like a show-off; how they have spent so much money. This movie is one dimensional like its characters and the writing is too lazy: both for the character developement and screenplay. The dialogues were pathetic, self-glorifying and at places they were quite absurd. Its quite funny actually when you see the close-ups come after a dialogue and these are apparently meant for you to clap or shout or blow whistles in the theatre. Amongst the lead trio, Shahid was pretty convincing but Ranveer&apos;s role was seemingly over stretched and Deepika had literaaly the same expression on her face throughout the movie. This movie was long and filled with shots showing the shallow depth of the background to make you notice its vastness. And don&apos;t forget some really good plot holes, and these are many in number too.\n\nHowever, the cinematography was good. Some visuals were great but the dance nubers were the ones to rescue. They were very well choreographed and the music was great( These reminded me me of watching a Bhansali movie).\n\nIf you sum the movie all up, then its nothing more than a mediocre treatment to an epic tale and you will feel that showing great pieces of art on screen doesn&apos;t make it a great art itself.",

      "reviewBody": "Boston Strangler, based on real killings in the early &apos;60s, comes off as a film that&apos;s trying hard to remain rivetingly mysterious as opposed to a Zodiac or a Se7en. It has a first act that instantly hooks your investigative interests, and as the cases begin to pile up, there are many leads the film puts forward. Cinematographer Ben Kutchins attributes as a dark, softened glow to the frames, not too distant from the visual style of a David Fincher thriller. But the plot developments in the subsequent acts don&apos;t mesh well. You&apos;re given many names and faces, and you&apos;re expected to look at each one with a specific level of suspicion. Towards the end, I lost interest, just like one of those cops (played by Alessandro Nivola) who worked on one of the cases. It doesn&apos;t take much on Keira Knightley&apos;s part to slip into the role of Loretta, and I also liked how Matt Ruskin&apos;s writing discussed the casual sexism of that era. But that&apos;s all there is!",

      "reviewBody": "Why do I love this movie so much? I&apos;m not a baseball fan. I didn&apos;t really like FIELD OF DREAMS. And I hated BULL DURHAM. Yet this movie just captivates me every time I watch it.\n\nPart of it is the tight, real-time structure -- the whole movie takes place in a man&apos;s head while he pitches a perfect baseball game on the mound. It therefore combines the tension of a thriller with the poignant emotions of an elegy.\n\nBut what I loved most about this movie is that there are no clichés. Kevin Costner&apos;s character, Billy Chapel, is not a &quot;sports underdog.&quot; It&apos;s very clear he is a great athlete who has had a great career, and that he can walk away at any time with lots of money and lots of respect. The only reason that pitching the perfect game matters to him is purely for the perfection of his art -- for the love of the game.\n\nAt the same time, not all the action is on the baseball diamond. In the romantic drama, Kevin Costner does much more than play the usual Costner &quot;nice guy.&quot; Billy Chapel can be cold, egocentric, and difficult -- just like any other creative artist. But he always surrounds himself with people who are strong enough to challenge him and help him stay grounded. It&apos;s no exaggeration to say that the supporting cast in this film -- John C. Reilly as the catcher, Kelly Preston as the girl friend, and Jena Malone as the girl friend&apos;s adorable teenage daughter -- are very much the stars. They really set Costner up for an unusually mature, disciplined performance. Just the way Chapel&apos;s team mates set him up for the perfect game! This movie wasn&apos;t that well received by the critics. I remember one frightfully cultured fellow at the NEW YORKER sniffing that Costner&apos;s character is &quot;arrogant.&quot; Note well that if an artist or an intellectual is cold and demanding, it&apos;s okay. But athletes should be jolly, ape like simpletons, the kind who know their place. This complex, poignant movie is actually quite subversive, since it forces you to realize that baseball is a thinking man&apos;s game and that athletes (and their working class fans) are not nearly as stupid as the real simpletons who write for the NEW YORKER.\n\nShocking!!!",

The only new Classics are that of the anime genre, these are the movies that inspire so many huge american action movies, as well as TV shows...(James Cameron&apos;s Battle..er... I mean Dark Angel....A**hole)  You have the Matrix taking famous scenes from every popular anime series out there and calling it original!  Let&apos;s hope and pray that this doesn&apos;t happen to Vampire Hunter D.\n\nVampire Hunter D is one of the most remarkable love stories to date, it takes calssic cinema and pushes it, it&apos;s funny that this movie was made over 10 years ago but it still holds strong in my memory, especially in the DVD incarnation as well as the new movie coming out.  If there is anything close to Nosfarateu this is it."

Easily one of the best independent films ever produced. Matarazzo is brilliant perfection as 11 year old Dawn Wiener - Wiener Dog - who is trying desperately to survive the 7th grade NJ suburban hell with her existence as a gawky, nerdy yet smarter- than-the-rest protagonist facing every conceivable roadblock to hurdle including a dimwitted hunky high schooler and a seemingly threatening classmate (Sexton who is also great) who can&apos;t decide if he wants to &quot;rape&quot; her. Heartbreaking and all too close to the bone perfectly realized depiction of how judgemental we all are and just how harrowing adolescence really is. Dare not to be angered when her self-indulgent mother takes away her cake at the dinner table while the rest of the monstrous family greedily eat their desserts. Black comedy satire and documentarian genres blending seamlessly to a genuine masterpiece of poignancy sharply observant parable of anomie and angst by writer and director Todd Solondz (who won the Best Picture prize at Sundance). Wickedly funny and dead on accurate."

      "reviewBody": "There can be no real victors in war if we value human life at all.  That so many German and Russian boys should die in the snow-bound wilderness around Stalingrad is a tragedy beyond comprehension.  The camera crew did a great job in bringing to the screen the vastness of Russia with soldiers camouflaged in white struggling on the point of death across frozen landscapes.  Far from home and missing their loved ones the German soldiers are depicted as rough diamonds with kind hearts sharing their last crust of bread with starving Russian children.  The over-all German plan is to take certain cities important in the flow of oil and supply of food to the Russian enemy, but their plans are thwarted when the Russian armies encircle them.  The close fighting is well filmed with lots of explosions, flames and shattered bodies among fallen masonry.  I liked particularly the contrast of the opening scenes in sunny Porto Cervo (where the Germans are celebrating their recent victories) with the tragic scenes which followed when calamity overtakes them.I thought too that the three struggling figures exhausted in defeat symbolised the horrific loss of human life and the futility of war. While none of the actors shone above the others, their characterisations were adequate enough though I got somewhat confused with such a large cast and all the same uniforms.  The lasting impression is not with individual performances but with the over-all mood of this tragic event captured superbly under expert direction.  One soldier says to another:&quot;This will give us the Iron Cross&quot; The reply:&quot;Yes...it will look good on your coffin!&quot;",

Rooney Mara was great, as usual, bringing charisma to an otherwise desolate and charmless experience that inevitably led me to write this. As mentioned by so many people before me: what a disappointing waste of a phenomenal idea. This could have been something riveting. Perhaps my reception was tainted by Jason Segel&apos;s lack of likability. Is it my fault? In any case, I don&apos;t care.

      "reviewBody": "I was excited to see this because I knew the lead actors for playing support roles only like Nathalie Emmanuel in GOT and fast and furious or Thomas Doherty in high fidelity and legacies. I love how it starts off dark, it&apos;s not uncommon for recent horrors to ease you in by starting out like any regular movie before throwing you into the dark. It maintains it&apos;s gloomy nature despite the characters having a more cheery aura, but you feel something&apos;s off. It&apos;s like a blend of midsommer, Ready or Not and Get Out, with a fantasy element to it. Midsommer and Ready Or Not were more bloody thrillers than actual horrors in my opinion while this was actively trying to scare you. It has a more old fashioned horror feel compared to recent &apos;blockbuster horrors&apos; (I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s a thing); everything happens in the dark, there&apos;s a lot of build up and I loved how 3AM was made the hour the devil comes out to play. It also leaned on it&apos;s gloomy atmosphere and jump scares for the horror element.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot of build up to most scenes so it was slow paced, I felt some silences were literally just 2s too long. Second twist in the third act of the movie wasn&apos;t pretty underwhelming, and this was meant to be the big closer. I also try to avoid trailers but i saw a teaser that ruined the suspense and thrill of one of the scenes, so I suggest doing a better job at avoiding them than I did. For that same reason, when everything unveiled I was pleasantly surprised it&apos;s not the genre of horror I thought this was going to be, won&apos;t say &apos;cause I don&apos;t wanna spoil it for you but I haven&apos;t seen a horror in this fantasy genre in a while so I loved it.\n\nAll in all, I think it&apos;s a good movie that was supposed to be better than it is because the climax scenes don&apos;t hit as high as they&apos;re meant to, with a rushed finale to top that. Otherwise the movie doesn&apos;t do much wrong and is worth a watch for me. Somebody said it&apos;s a feminist movie, I see where they&apos;re coming from but that&apos;s such a reach man.",

If only a movie like TOMB RAIDER or MUMMY RETURNS (or even CATS &amp; DOGS) were to pay as much attention to characterization!\n\nThe sci-fi elements, while cheesy, actually serve a purpose, and work quite well within the framework of the story.  It&apos;s essentially a feature-length episode of &quot;AMAZING STORIES.&quot;\n\nUltimately, this is a small movie with a small scope and intimate feel.  Is it dated?  Yes.  Is it perfect?  No.  But it is a charming little movie that might be worth a second look."

The making of this film was somewhat controversial because Braff used Kickstarter to raise funds for the film he co-wrote with his brother Adam Braff, so that he could make it exactly how he wanted to. While I enjoyed the film and found it to be touching and moving at times and very funny at other times, there was nothing about it that was brilliant. The cast includes Braff as Aidan Bloom, Kate Hudson as his supportive wife Sarah, Mandy Patinkin as his father, Josh Gad as his brother Noah, and Joey King and Pierce Gagnon as his daughter and son. I thought King was quite good in her role as an almost teen-aged girl.\n\nI certainly don&apos;t regret seeing this film, but there really isn&apos;t much to recommend it either. But if you happen to be somewhere where it is playing and are just a bit curious, go ahead and see it. I don&apos;t think you will regret it.",

This is by no stretch of the imagination a good movie in any sense, but you cant help but laugh yourself silly through most of it. \n\nPlot line is this: A group of ravers travel to an island near Seattle, an island known as Isla del Morte (Island of the dead, and my Spanish spelling is likely incorrect). Once they arrive, they find the biggest rave of the year deserted. Why? they find out once they stumble upon survivors and are shown video footage of what happened. \n\nThis is really an elementary movie, poorly written by Mark Altman (who did one of my favorite films, &quot;Free Enterprise&quot;) and equally poorly acted by the mainly unknown cast. Along with Jurgen Prochnow, Ellie Cornell (&quot;Halloween&quot; 4 &amp; 5) and Clint Howard (Ron&apos;s brother) are the only names I recognized. I really don&apos;t expect much from Clint (and he certainly delivered in that area) but Ellie and Jurgen usually do a little better than they showed here.\n\nJohnathan Cherry is really dull as Rudy, Tyron Leitso&apos;s Simon is an irritating little weasel, Ona Grauer&apos;s Alicia is really nice to look at, but not much else...so on and so forth.\n\nLots and lots of pop culture references, including a mention of George A. Romero and the possibility of a 4th &quot;Dead&quot; film. See this one if you&apos;re a Romero fan...please...its a zombie movie and if the industry thinks thats what we want, then we&apos;ll get George&apos;s final vision that much sooner. \n\nThis is just not a good movie, but if you&apos;re like me and enjoy giving the &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; treatment to bad films, you should see this one. \n\n1/2 out of 5"

      "reviewBody": "This British-US-Italian co-production is set in 16th century, Venice. It&apos;s a taking on Shakespeare book based on ¨pound of flesh¨ drama, focusing a tale of religious and social prejudice, where the Jew Shylock gets its vengeance in a money loan .(Jeremy Irons) Antonio&apos;s friend Bassanio(Joseph Fiennes)is in love and needs money to go courting Portia(Lynn Collins.) Antonio borrows money from ambitious and revenger Shylock. Then, Shylock&apos;s daughter named Jessica(Zuleikha Robinson) runaway home with all jewels and money. The Jew Shylock(Al Pacino) has a long memory of oppression but vendetta isn&apos;t so sweet and reclaims repayment over Antonio&apos;s flesh. Shylock becomes furious and is extremely motived by the injustices of life as Jew. Meanwhile the trial is assembled and Portia goes into action to save Antonio.\n\nThis very enjoyable film is a balance of both, tragedy and comedy. As is both delightful, disturbing and dramatically marvellous. Al Pacino delivers a wonderfully complex and dark performance. His portrayal is pretty watchable and absolutely memorable, he&apos;s a Shakespeare expert , like he proved in ¨Looking for King Richard III¨ which he starred and and directed. I found particularly nice the way the film handled the court rivalry , the antagonism between them and final result. The movie packs an evocative musical score by Jocelyn Pock(Eye wide shut) and colorful cinematography by Benoit Delhomme, director&apos;s usual cameraman. The motion picture is well directed by Michael Radford. Another adaptation about this known book are mostly made for TV, these are the following : 1973 with Laurence Olivier, Joan Plowright and Jeremy Brett ; 1980 by Jack Gold with Warren Mitchell and John Rhys Davies ; 2001 by Trevor Nunn with Henry Goodman. And by Orson Welles with Oja Kodar but was scrapped and pretended to release with other of his unfinished movies, though never completed when the negatives were mysteriously lost. I would recommend this picture to anybody interested by Shakespeare.",

      "name": "Quite believable, says this former investigative journalist",
      "reviewBody": "As the subject line above says, I have to admit to an insider&apos;s point of view. I was an award-winning investigative reporter and editor working in newspapers, magazines, wire services, radio, and network-affiliate TV. I quit journalism in 1980 in large part because of the ever-increasing number of talent-challenged first-year &quot;journalists&quot; who wanted to be the next Woodward/Bernstein, and worse, the willingness of management (especially in local television news) to hire and even promote them. To be honest, however, I would have to add that the low pay, true even at places like The New Republic, was a major factor to an expectant father.\n\nSo I am sad to say that I completely buy the characterizations presented in this docudrama on Stephen Glass&apos; time at that august magazine. The only thing that didn&apos;t ring true was that I never met anyone who had the time or inclination to be as considerate of his fellow journalists as Steve Glass apparently was. My wife pointed out that she never met one journalistic co-worker she would spend time with if she had the choice. I would admit that the nicest I knew were, at best, benign. I should add that I was NOT the nicest I knew. Even I didn&apos;t like me those days.\n\nGetting back to the film, I can&apos;t speak to what actually motivated this particular person to fabricate 27 of 41 stories at a very major national magazine. The film suggests that he was too eager to please, and perhaps that is true. But that probably wasn&apos;t what motivated Jayson Blair (at the New York Times) or others who have recently been exposed as serial fabricators. Ambition unrestrained by ethics, unreasonable pressure to succeed due to premature promotions, other unknown and perhaps unknowable motivations... they probably figure into these sorts of disasters. But what is certainly true, and given very short shrift by the film, is the role journalistic management plays. To put a rather fine point to it, too many editors do not know how to, or perhaps just don&apos;t like to, do their jobs.\n\nToo many times I see on national news programs statements treated as fact that somehow I can&apos;t believe were ever fact-checked. Just today I saw an episode of HBO&apos;s RealSports where an amazing statistic was mentioned: that a certain percentage (I believe about 4% but wasn&apos;t taking notes) of people who start playing poker as young kids go on to have gambling problems. I instantly asked myself: where did those statistics come from? Poker playing among the very young (pre-college-age) was probably a fairly rare thing before the past couple of years. How would they know today that 15 years ago such-and-such a percent would later have problems? If you understand statistics you would know that you can&apos;t find gambling addicts now, ask how many played poker as young kids, and extrapolate any useful estimate of future danger (100% of alcoholics once drank socially, but that doesn&apos;t mean 100% of social drinkers go on to become alcoholics). So did some editor at RealSports check this out? Why don&apos;t I believe someone did?\n\nIn writing this six-paragraph movie review, perhaps to be seen by no one, I checked things over time and again for accuracy. Oops: I misspelled Jayson Blair; fix it. Spelling errors no one cares about in this Internet-only story: check the entire piece in an external spell checker. In all I made almost two dozen changes. No one reading this will notice, or if they do, care. But that is what I do because I once was an editor.\n\nIt is this instinct for distrust of EVERYTHING anyone says or writes, including oneself and one&apos;s own work, that I believe is missing in far too many editors today. It is this shortcoming that allowed Stephen Glass, Jayson Blair et al to last so long before being exposed. It is a major weakness in journalism, and the lack of acknowledgement of this weakness is the only fault I found in this otherwise excellent film.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this in a theatre. The acting in this film is the shinning point. Especially the main actor Irfaan khan made a great impression on my mind by his excellent acting skill. Irfaan excellently potrayed the emotion of a &quot;runner&quot; who is suffering from pain, frustration and exhaustion, but he is not giving up. The rest is the portrayal of a man who has never had it easy in his life but nonetheless keeps his heart. The screenplay is brilliant. Being a biopic of an army guy/athlete who turned into a dacoit won&apos;t b a happy/fun movie. It&apos;s a very sad movie. But Irfann did manage to evoke some light moments by his sheer one liners n acting. Imagine an athlete who&apos;s very good in running has to run away from police. The direction was good n the cinematography was good capturing the harsh, dry, rural difficult terrain.",

I haven&apos;t even bothered to rate this because even rating this film &quot;0&quot; is too high.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t say the acting is bad because saying it was bad would be too generous to the actors/actresses in this film. I have been more convinced by E-mails claiming I can access a bank account worth 10 Million if I pay 10 grand to activate it. As for the writer, well it wouldn&apos;t surprise me if it was written by a child because that is the sort of stuff a 6 year old would scribble down if told to write a story. From a technical viewpoint, this film wasn&apos;t the worst if you exclude every other film made in history. As for comedy - Well this film makes Schindler&apos;s list look like Monty Python, I found this film about as funny as AIDS. Now romance is the only convincing factor in this film, that is if your idea of romance is watching a drunken 1 night stand where both parties have very unsatisfactory sex.\n\nI can&apos;t rate this because it is like lining your Grandmothers up and rating their looks. Just don&apos;t bother, for the sake of your mental health, don&apos;t bother - Spend the day licking dirt off the floor or something but avoid watching this...&apos;film&apos;."

The film's unique reverse chronological structure and its exploration of existential questions are frequently highlighted.

The dance sequences and the film's emotional impact are often noted as standout elements. However, some reviewers find the film's pacing and structure uneven, with certain parts feeling less impactful than others. The film's message about living life to the fullest and cherishing moments is widely appreciated, though some feel it could be conveyed with less sentimentality. Overall, 'The Life of Chuck' is seen as a heartfelt, if occasionally flawed, exploration of life's meaning and the importance of human connections.",

The rest of the cast is worth more than an honorable mention alone, as many familiar faces grace the screen (especially toward the beginning of the film). Lastly, I tend to love this &apos;type&apos; of movie. I can&apos;t give too much away without using a spoiler tag, but if you watch the interview(s) with the cast featured here on IMDB, you&apos;ll know what &quot;type&quot; I am referring to. I wonder if I can get away with &apos;apocalyptic&apos;, since that is a word straight from one of these interviews.\n\nThat said ... it was a bit of a letdown for me.\n\nThe beginning was slow, but it was good. It built an expectancy toward so much more and a feeling that it was going to get so much better. Sadly, that was never fully realized or delivered.\n\nBeginning in the second act, the film definitely starts to bog down and suffers from side or follow-up scenes that are just way too long and a bit far-fetched. The narration, too, is used far too often to the point of it just about verging on annoying.\n\nBy the third act, when they begin to introduce what is supposed to be the point of the entire thing, it has already been too bogged down by too much of not enough - if that makes sense. While the child actor is adorable and does so well, here too the movie just drags.\n\nMoreover, everything is so overly-EXPLAINED. It&apos;s kind of like Flanagan did not trust the audience to understand what was happening, so either the narrator or characters went to great lengths to explain every detail. Well, while some may disagree, I believe audiences are more intelligent than this film gives them (us) credit for.\n\nSorry Mike Flanagan fans, but this is the third time I have been let down by one of his offerings. :(",

As highly competitive swimmers the girls were training to compete in the Olympics. Now instead of swimming in a pool, Yusra and Sara are trying out the Mediterranean. Other obstacles threatening to pull them under include a broken-down raft overloaded with passengers, barbed wire fences, dogs, police, and criminals eager to profit from desperate refugees. Still, the greatest currents that they are swimming against are in themselves.\n\nThis miraculous true story sheds light on a pressing global issue. Over 6 million refugees fled from Syria since 2011. Following the story of Yusra and Sara helps us to understand the issues that refugees face. The actors are sisters in real life, so their chemistry is authentic and comes from spending a lifetime together. It is heartwarming to witness Yusra and Sara holding onto life and their love for each other. The filmmakers are no slouches themselves, and there are some amazing scenes including a dance sequence in an empty warehouse.",

      "reviewBody": "You can see every cent on the screen. That&apos;s the good thing about Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s latest and quite possibly last movie. Between the cast, the costuming, and the set design, which reimagines New York City as New Rome, you can see it all. The only question this raises is why was 42nd Street from Third Avenue to Times Square left unaffected, and what about the movie theaters from 7th to 8th Avenue?\n\nThat said, it is natural to be skeptical of what is essentially an admiring biopic of Robert Moses. Especially when it has apparently been written by Ayn Rand as a reply to METROPOLIS and then handed to Abel Gance after convincing him he&apos;s making a movie about Julius Caesar instead of Napoleon. And don&apos;t forget the quotations from Marcus Aurelius.\n\nIt is, in sum, a very learned movie. To appreciate the details, you need to have read extensively in Roman history, seen a lot of silent films, and be familiar with New York City in the second half of the 20th Century, including the flight of the middle and upper classes from the 1950s through the 1980s. Through the vagaries of my upbringing and a chaotic course of self-education, I can claim those things. So. What do I think?\n\nThe performances are fine. However, I am left with the question, as I am about so many movies these days, of who Coppola made this movie for. It is claimed he spent about $140 million of his own money on this feature. The general rule is that a movie has to gross about twice its production cost to break even. I can&apos;t see a large enough audience for this to produce $300,000,000 in tickets and secondary rights. It is simply too long, a shaggy dog story about love and artistic vision being more important than anything else.\n\nThis would not, of course, be the first time that Coppola has let his artistic ambitions explode on him; even though it is claimed APOCALYPSE NOW eventually made its money back, I have my doubts about that if you add in interest costs. Certainly ONE FROM THE HEART was a disaster, and he spent a couple of decades making nicely commercial movies from other sources to dig his way out, and let the wineries and restaurants make him money. Neither do I believe this movie will ruin him. There are certainly enough movies buffs around to make the net loss from this bearable.\n\nAll of which goes a long way to answering my question of who Coppola&apos;s intended audience was. It was Coppola himself, an attempt to prove himself the complete film maker, instead of the fine translator of others&apos; well told tales. I hope he likes what he has wrought.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;It&apos;s such a sad old feeling, the fields are soft and green, it&apos;s memories that I&apos;m stealing, but you&apos;re innocent when you dream, when you dream, you&apos;re innocent when you dream&quot; ---Tom Waits \n\nSmoke is a very difficult film to describe because it does not unfold with a coherent narrative, but rather with slice-of-life vignettes about chance, communication, and inter-connectedness. Author Paul Auster and director Wayne Wang (The Joy Luck Club) worked on the story for years before it reached the screen and the collaboration produces a highly literate, novelistic cinema that is divided into separate chapters, each elaborating a different character. I have seen this small masterpiece many times, but I keep watching it because I love its celebration of the simple pleasures of life: friendships, good conversation, and, of course, smoking a good cigar. Smoke is not a complex or experimental film, just a beautiful and simple delineation of humanity.\n\nHarvey Keitel plays Auggie Wren, the owner of a small cigar store in Brooklyn. An amateur photographer as well as a raconteur of tall tales, Auggie has taken one photograph a day from the street corner outside his store every day for the past 14 years. &quot;People say you have to travel to see the world,&apos;&apos; Auggie says. &quot;Sometimes I think that if you just stay in one place and keep your eyes open, you&apos;re going to see just about all that you can handle.&apos;&apos; When a friend comments that all the snapshots look alike, Auggie points out the differences: the light, the season, and the look on people&apos;s faces. It&apos;s all a matter of slowing down, Auggie says, being in present time, and observing what is in front of you.\n\nOne of the store&apos;s regular customers is writer Paul Benjamin (William Hurt) who hasn&apos;t published a novel since his wife died a few years ago in an incident of street violence. When a young Black man, Rashid Cole, (Harold Perrineau Jr.) saves Paul&apos;s life by pulling him away from on an oncoming car, Paul offers him a place to sleep. The lives of the two become intertwined in the young man&apos;s encounter with some robbers and in his search for his father, brilliantly played by Forrest Whitaker. When Auggie&apos;s former lover, Ruby (Stockard Channing), shows up, she tells Auggie he has a pregnant daughter (Ashley Judd) that now needs his help. These incidents come together in a powerful, fully realized conclusion.\n\nAlthough Smoke has its moments of high drama, it is mostly a low-key, slice-of-life type of film that depicts events in life as happening for a purpose, not as random or chance occurrences. The characters are not &quot;movie colorful&quot;, but ordinary down-to-earth people brought to realization by a flawless ensemble cast. The film reaches a sublime conclusion in a tender Christmas story narrated by Keitel and supported by Tom Waits&apos; haunting song &quot;Innocent When You Dream&quot;. Everyone ends up in a better place than when they started, including myself as viewer.",

Philip Seymour Hoffman (Jon, the professor) and Laura Linney (as Wendy, aspiring playwright)are perfectly cast in the roles of the sister and brother who have to deal with their obnoxious, foul-mouthed elderly father, Lenny, played by Philip Bosco in a riveting performance.\n\nTheir childhoods have been difficult, abuse is hinted at along with a runaway mother. They are now confronted with the care and responsibility of their father who has been deemed incompetent (and penniless). The effects of their childhood on these now adult children is played out well. They are incapable of intimacy with potential partners and even with each other.\n\nHow they slowly gain an understanding of themselves and each other is an ongoing major thread of the movie and is beautifully depicted. A one of a kind sibling movie. 9 out of 10. Recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "S A M S A R A (my little review)\n\nRon Fricke, creator of the films Chaos and Baraka creates a tour de sympathy with his third, evocative, deeply stirring, film Samsara, a movie that points directly at personal responsibility, empowerment, and the price of thoughtless consumption, attachment, creation of ideologies to supplant a close relationship with life, but also a sort of raging against the dying of the light... and those who pay the price in society... the spirit of man, the animals we share this planet with, women, children and nature itself... \n\nFirst off I would recommend this movie, this beautiful movie shot in 70mm full of color and feeling, that traverses the globe, and one&apos;s own heart. The film makes a Tibetan sand mandala of us all, blossoms a petal of truth within, then wipes away the dross... \n\nI believe there is not only a definite thread to follow, but it&apos;s rather like seeing a natural singularity becoming split into the myriad activities of all humanity, the occurring entanglements, and then how it comes back together into the singularity within the heart, the seat of the soul. We always have a choice to diverge or to return to the inlet of our spiritual sea, the remembrance of our natural state as humanity... I believe the movie gets this across in such a beautiful and simple way that it&apos;s life changing. I don&apos;t think everyone will get it in the moment, I believe a seed will be planted in some, watered in others, and blossom in others, but for each where they stand, the movie will meet you where you are if you are open to its message.\n\nGo see this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I work at a cinema in norwich (UCI) i was checking our listing and saw this film on them, thought what the hell is that!? i asked a friend and he said it was about some climbers, i remember catching a breif review on some tv show ages ago. Being a climber myself i decided to go see it asap. A few guests asked me whether to see Out of Time or this and i said i&apos;d go with this coz it sounds much better. They went into see it, I had a few minutes to kill at work so i went and watched the first 10mins, i really struggled to pull myself away. I was standing at the exit to the screen when the film finished, and i noticed a strange things happen, nobody left till the end of the credits!!! I went and saw it the next day with a few friends. As the trailers rolled i started munching on my bag of chocolates and sipping at my pepsi, then as the film started i just couldn&apos;t take my eyes off the screen, the cinematography is amazing (i studied film) the shots are just fantastic, tremendous scenery.\n\nThe film builds up the tension and sheer drama of what they are attempting well. After a while u forget you are watching a documentary and just start watching it like any other film. as the excitement built up i realised i like Joe was frozen still, unable to move i felt his pain and the moment when he has the song in his head just gets right in your head as well and you start to feel sick as well.\n\nI&apos;ve never been as moved by a film as i have with touching the void with the exception of Schindler&apos;s List. When the film moved i realised i still had most of my chocolate and pepsi left, and everyone around me were just sitting there, me and my mates just slowely got up and walked out of the cinema not saying a word, we were all just so gobsmacked by what we had just witnessed.\n\nIf you get a chance, see ths film, it&apos;s one of the best movies i&apos;ve ever seen. 10/10\n\nDavid Wortley"

Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. I know they often lack in horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it didn&apos;t even put forth ANY effort in that department. Next, we all love suspense. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night had none of that! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night have that? Nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil&apos; knife. And when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 like Prom Night, they leave that stuff out too. So with all of these elements missing, I ask....does this still count as a horror movie? Nope. I&apos;d call it more of a comedy. People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw &quot;Semi-Pro&quot; that was supposed to actually be a comedy (which also sucked, but thats another story!). I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror. All the good horror movies of the good ol&apos; days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see it with didn&apos;t even know this was a remake! Which made me mad! I wonder what will happen when there&apos;s no more movies to remake??? Where will horror go next???",

That said, &quot;Dumplin&apos;&quot; film feels like a low-risk, tv special, played at 8 pm. The script is overly-sentimental, and while the themes are worthy, the delivery felt flat.\n\nSeveral characters who deserved to be fleshed out got the short-shrift. I&apos;d like to see a more layered narrative of the lives of drag queens, apart from their entertainment value, but this film missed the mark. Even &quot;Bo&quot;, the teenage hunk was reduced to a cardboard figure, imbued with cliched sound bites. Kathy Najimy (a fine actor) was given a perfunctory role, filled with animated actions.\n\nIf you want to see Aniston deliver a riveting portrayal, see the film &quot;CAKE&quot;. Sadly, she is not believable in this role. Although &quot;Patti Cake$ was not a great film, I enjoyed the performance of MacDonald more in that project. While &quot;Dumplin&quot; was not altogether terrible (most of the actors gave it their best), the script is in sore need of refinement and enriched characterizations."

The dialog, facial expression and spot on timing of the action keep this mash up of genres amusing every step of the way. Just when you think you know which way it&apos;s heading, it either makes fun of the standard clichés or skips them entirely, casting us into a twist and turn that starts it all over again with an entirely new plot development. And when you think you know where that plot line is headed, it does it again. I really enjoyed the character Amos played by Glen-Paul Waru. His bumbling energy kept me chuckling. I also enjoyed the fact that even though this film gets pretty violent and gory at times, overall it is a good-natured, feel good movie that, like a roller coaster ride, is scary and fun and shocking and harmless all at the same time. Good job Gerard Johnstone!",

But I do not think the film, in itself, was the quality I would&apos;ve liked it to be.\n\nThe scenes seem to be too conservative at times. And the flashbacks to what had happened, previously, give the viewer an outside perspective of things. And it is that omniscient point of view that keeps the viewer from really becoming involved in the story.\n\nI think Ellen Page did an incredible job of acting. And I truly love her movies. But I wonder if the people making this film were so afraid of insulting certain persons that they did not want to submerge themselves into a truly emotional reenactment of what had actually happened.\n\nBottom line: If you want a story that is presented to you in segments, then by all means, watch this movie. But if you want a truly disturbing film that puts you in the eyes of the victim, and makes you feel sick to your stomach... then there are other movies based on the same event that are much more involved!!!"

      "reviewBody": "For those of you who are fans of the Broadway musical, here is a list of the missing music: &quot;It Roars&quot; (replaced with a song that&apos;s not as good) &quot;Where Do You Belong?&quot; (What were they thinking by leaving out this showstopper?!) &quot;Meet The Plastics&quot; (Only Regina&apos;s first few verses were sung. Gretchen &amp; Karen&apos;s parts were cut) &quot;Fearless&quot; &quot;Stop&quot; (Again, what were they thinking by cutting out a showstopper?) &quot;What&apos;s Wrong With Me&quot; (reprise) &quot;Whose House Is This?&quot; &quot;More Is Better&quot; &quot;Do This Thing&quot;\n\nThis is supposed to be a film version of the musical, not a remake of the original fetch &amp; flawless film. So, leaving out so many songs was a bad idea. The characters all suffered from this choice; they all seemed too bland.\n\nCady did not sing &quot;Apex Predator.&quot; Instead, Damian sang &quot;And though Janice is great, she does not have this power,&quot; while Janice shrugged. This was such a poor choice, because we didn&apos;t see Cady falling under Regina&apos;s spell. Gretchen&apos;s changing relationship with Regina didn&apos;t play out well. The actress who played Gretchen captured the character when she spoke, but when she sang &quot;What&apos;s Wrong With Me&quot; in Regina&apos;s closet, it just didn&apos;t make me feel for her. Something got lost in translation.\n\nA lot of the comedy was lost in this version. Although &quot;Sexy&quot; was filmed well, Karen just wasn&apos;t as funny as she was in the 1st movie or the Broadway version. Damian wasn&apos;t as funny; without his biggest songs, he didn&apos;t shine.\n\n&quot;Fearless&quot; may not have been the biggest hit song, but I felt the loss of it. There needed to be a sharply hit moment when Cady realizes she is the new Queen Bee, freed of her oppressive relationship with Regina. The original film used voiceover to convey that realization and the musical used the song &quot;Fearless.&quot; The film musical kind of glossed it over.\n\nAnother thing that was missing was the image of all the plastics walking together, all looking beautiful and glamorous. &quot;Being in the Plastics was like being famous.&quot; On Broadway, &quot;Apex Predator&quot; captured that feel, but in this movie, the song focused on Regina alone and lost the power of the clique.\n\nThe Plastics just weren&apos;t feminine enough. Everyone looked too tough. It was like this version took place at the &quot;south side&quot; school that the principal said he left in the original. Even the nerds didn&apos;t seem nerdy enough. Regina started out looking like she had already been eating Calteen bars for months and we didn&apos;t see her change after Cady tricked her.\n\nThe chemistry between Cady and Aaron also did not come through. Leaving out &quot;More Is Better&quot; and the Aaron&apos;s part in &quot;Stupid With Love&quot; didn&apos;t help.\n\n&quot;I See Stars&quot; was a magical finale on Broadway, but this film did not end with musical magic.\n\nWhat did I like? &quot;Revenge Party&quot; was still lots of fun and it was filmed in a colorful way. &quot;World Burn&quot; was done well, and &quot;I&apos;d Rather Be Me&quot; had a great energy.",

It feels tremendously authentic to it&apos;s time and subjects. The acting is very good throughout, and the movie is just a very fun, and very human story. One that is easy for almost anyone to relate to in some way.\n\nThere are a number of great performances in this film. Winona Ryder plays one of her most interesting characters, and she pulls it off very well. Bob Hoskins is very strong and enjoyable as usual. Personally I have always loved Cher&apos;s acting. I can&apos;t say I&apos;m a huge fan of her music, but I&apos;ve always had some respect for her there too. However her acting has always been very strong in my opinion. I know she has been nominated for multiple Oscars and even won one for Moonstruck. However I still think her acting is somewhat underrated by most people. (And she also gave Nick Cage his first huge break after demanding that the studios cast Cage opposite her in Moonstruck. Cage was thought to be somewhat of a risky bet back in those days, and Cher basically made the major studios take the chance with him. Which I find somewhat funny, and also very Cher like.). Cher also had the original director of this film, and the girl who was originally cast in Winona&apos;s part fired. So Winona fans also have Cher to thank for her even being in this film. It&apos;s hard to criticize Cher for getting rid of these originals either, seeing as how well the film turned out with the people she approved. She is a very strong minded and hearted woman in my view, and if you take a look at Silkwood, Mask, Moonstruck, and this nice little film. You will undoubtedly also see that this woman can flat out act. She has some other decent films as well.\n\nAnyway, all in all, I highly recommend Mermaids to anyone that likes character driven film. And basically to any teen, male or female. It is basically a coming of age story in terms of Winona&apos;s character, and even for Cher and Hoskins characters to some degree too. :) And there is a lot to relate to in terms of the parent/child relationship, especially the single parent. Those with Attention Deficit Disorder , or those who get bored easy may not get into it however. :) I gave this film a 7, but I&apos;m a pretty strict rater, and this film is a very solid 7 in my opinion. In fact, I&apos;d give it a 7.5 if I could.\n\n7.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Damon and his teenage daughter, Cee, are heading to a forested moon where they hope to strike it rich prospecting for precious gems. It won&apos;t be easy though; the air must be filtered due to toxic spores and anybody they encounter is unlikely to be friendly. Things go wrong from the start; their lander is damaged as they enter the atmosphere and they miss their intended landing site by some way. An early encounter leaves Cee on her own; if she is to survive and get off the moon again she will have to make an unlikely alliance.\n\nI rather enjoyed this film; it might not be a classic and was clearly made for a relatively small amount but the story is solid in a fairly simply way. It may be set on a distant moon but the plot could come straight from a western. It is somewhat episodic with our protagonist facing a series of dangers that she must overcome but that isn&apos;t a problem. The tension is kept fairly high as there is always some danger to be overcome. The small cast does a solid job; most obviously Sophie Thatcher who really impressed as Cee; a character who toughens up nicely as she overcomes various dangers. Also notable are Pedro Pascal as Ezra and Jay Duplass as Damon. There aren&apos;t too many special effects but those that there are are pretty good in an unshowy way. The setting looks good; the forest being lush but also somewhat claustrophobic; one can&apos;t help feeling it would be easy to get lost there. Overall an enjoyable little sci-fi that is well worth watching.",

He and his heir, Yoshikazu labor all day to buy the best raw fish at the market and sell the best sushi. Nothing less.\n\nThe film does a good job tracking the preparation, from picking one out of ten fish at any time to delicately shaping tuna around rice or massaging octopi for 20 minutes before preparation. Buying the best rice is another ritual that has its own rules, and Jiro rules.\n\nAlthough the documentary can be repetitious, moments of beauty accompany the process such as likening serving sushi to a concert with different moods and tempos.\n\nIt might be best to see this film on a full stomach. Otherwise you&apos;ll be racing to the nearest Asian bistro. Not a bad thing."

      "reviewBody": "Off-kilter Korean neo-western &quot;The Good, the Bad, the Weird,&quot; is a frenetic genre mash-up packed with visceral, loopy violence. That isn&apos;t a complement so much as it is a description. \n\nSuffice it to say, if you&apos;re into a modernist, freewheeling foreign take on Leone&apos;s &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,&quot; with cartoony characters and outrageous action, you&apos;re going to have a blast; if you&apos;re looking for a substantive or meditative reflection on the period or the original film, you&apos;re in the wrong line.\n\nPersonally, I&apos;m caught between the two perspectives. I appreciate the pure Peckinpah punch of the gunplay, but was in equal parts bored and bewildered by the overall film. Perhaps the principal flaw in writer/director Ji-woon Kim&apos;s script is that he indulges in too much of a good thing. His action sequences are a lot of fun, and the über-stylized retro/modern aesthetic delivers bizarre and inventive visuals like a gunslinger in a deep-sea diving helmet.\n\nBut the deafening sound effects and quick cutting style wear thin if not appropriately paced, and &quot;The Good, the Bad, the Weird,&quot; is almost relentless in its drag race to the final showdown. I&apos;m loathe to draw a comparison to &quot;Transformers&quot; here, but Kim proves that even good action has a threshold, and there are times in his film where it&apos;s easy to let your eyes glaze over.\n\nIn its more quiet moments, the story, a very loose retelling of &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot; follows a band of misfit thieves who come into possession of a treasure map sought by both Chinese thugs and the Japanese military. What&apos;s maybe most interesting about the film is seeing the conventions, chronology, and geography of the western customized to fit eastern ideology, and China&apos;s Taklimakan desert stands in for Manchuria circa 1940.\n\nThe tone is played as loose as the history, however, and Kim is never bogged down by self- seriousness or the oft-stringent requirements of a period piece. &quot;The Good, the Bad, the Weird&quot; is closer to a gleeful &quot;Kill Bill&quot; in tone than South Korea&apos;s own operatic, ultraviolent &quot;Oldboy,&quot; and benefits from it. Kim easily leapfrogs from hard-hitting shoot-outs to charming comedy, a phenomenon that has everything to do with his incredible cast. Each of the title characters, Park Do-won (Good), Park Chang-yi (Bad), and Yoon Tae-goo (Weird), brings with him a distinct tonal octave that lends the film some much-needed variety. My lone gripe in this department is that it would have been nice to get to know them a little bit better. As it stands, their rifles seem to have far more to say.\n\nAnd for many, that won&apos;t be an issue. I&apos;ve no question that there exists a very appreciative audience for this film—I&apos;m just not it. Nevertheless, I&apos;m only too happy to report that everything basically works. The cinematography is frequently gorgeous, the performances are stellar, and the action is kinetic—There&apos;s just too much of it. By the end of the two-hour engagement, what should be a satisfying, visceral finale comes off as extravagant hoopla.\n\nAs viewers we shouldn&apos;t be conditioned to expect non-stop action, because once you pass the threshold, there&apos;s a diminishing return on adrenaline, impressive as any sequence that follows may be. &quot;The Good, The Bad, The Weird&quot; gets all its forward momentum right, but could benefit from applying the brakes more frequently. \n\nThen again, maybe that reckless pace is what made it such a fast, fun ride to begin with.",

Great photography and spellbinding music score that really conjures up the dry dustbowl that is the archetypal, central Australia backwater town, with its hidden dark secrets and creepy bill-hilly descendants of Botany Bay; so much so you can almost feel the oppressive heat and stifling atmosphere hemming you into your seat; just like PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK (1975) did all those year ago and with the same serious aplomb.\n\nIt is a basic whodunnit story and not for the crash, bang , wallop brigade but for those who like to sit back and be absorbed into the landscape and watch from a distance and it unfolds so methodically and with such a well paced, directed, photographed and acted ensemble that it is hard to stop watching. With a masterful performance and perfect casting of the always on form Eric Bana. I actually had a tear in my eye at the final denouement; always a great sign that a movie has done its job well. It made a superb nights viewing and a film I could watch again - for me that is another sign of a good movie!!!\n\nHighly recommended, one of the best films this year and anyone who has read Jan Harper&apos;s book will be happy as it has not been hacked to death as usually happens in the Hollywood movie-zone!",

Perhaps deeply religious people have a tougher time than others, because they often judge themselves at least as harshly as their communities.\n\nRachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams do a great job playing the two childhood friends (Ronit and Esti) who meet again years later, only to discover that their feelings for each other haven&apos;t changed. Alessandro Nivola plays the young rabbi husband (Dovid) of Rachel McAdams character (Esti), and portrays him beautifully.\n\nI encourage you to see it. I doubt that you&apos;ll regret it.",

      "reviewBody": "Unfortunately I didn&apos;t manage to catch the 2004 Thai original before this American remake premiered at the annual Belgian Horror and Fantasy Festival. I didn&apos;t bother to see it when it initially got released because there already was an overload of Asian Ghost movies at that time and I really couldn&apos;t cope enduring another dull and scare-free imitation of &quot;Ringu&quot;. After seeing the US remake I&apos;m definitely interested in checking out the original sooner or later. The basic idea of restless spirits trying to communicate through photography is remotely original, but the elaboration (at least in this remake) remains somewhat tedious and predictable. Immediately after their marriage, Jane follows her photographer husband Ben to Tokyo where his friends arranged a splendid job for him. Jane, but soon after also Ben, suffers from visions of a deceased girl and all the pictures they make are ruined by ghostly images of this same girl. There&apos;s more than obviously a link between this girl and Ben&apos;s past days as a bachelor, but Jane only gradually learns the truth of what happened exactly. To my knowledge, this is the first and so far only Thai film to be remade by a Japanese director but with American funds and cast members. Talk about an international co-production! Masayuki Ochiai previously directed the incredibly atmospheric and uncanny hospital-horror film &quot;Infection&quot;, so he definitely knows how to build up suspense and terror through suggestion. The main problem here is that the ghostly subject matter is too &quot;soft&quot; and doesn&apos;t lend itself to provide some genuine shock-moments. We&apos;ve all seen too many (Asian) horror movies already in which white-faced spirits spontaneously appear &amp; disappear again, and the mystery is always build up towards a point where the script can&apos;t possibly fulfill the audience&apos;s anticipations anymore. In &quot;Shutter&quot;, you rather quickly figure out that Ben knows than he tells, so you can easily guess each and every plot twist far in advance. There are a very limited number of sets and exterior locations. Why didn&apos;t the film take advantage of the wondrous city of Tokyo, like for example &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; did? Rachael Taylor is certainly a promising actress with a lot of growing potential, so I hope she&apos;ll get offered a couple of better screenplays in the near future. Thus far, she only has horror rubbish like &quot;See No Evil&quot; and &quot;Man-Thing&quot; on her repertoire and those things won&apos;t get her noticed. Neither will &quot;Shutter&quot;, for that matter.",

      "reviewBody": "The previews that I saw for this movie promised it to be a very funny movie...and for the most part it was but it could have been better.\n\nThe movie is about a conservative British fellow (Hugh Grant) that runs an auction house in New York. He decides to propose to his girlfriend (Jeanne Tripplehorn) but she has reservations about marriage as her father has connections to the mafia. In her opinion, this marriage will not work as Grant&apos;s character will invariably be sucked into the organized crime life. He assures her that he won&apos;t and they decide to go ahead with the marriage. As you guessed it, Grant does become entangled and what ensues is a humorous &quot;fish-out-of-water&quot; comedy as Grant tries to get himself out of a mess.\n\nFor the most part, the characters were well played. Hugh Grant does a good job, albiet familiar to other characters that he&apos;s played recently (and probably not too unlike his real self) but it was nonetheless well played. Most of the humor revolves around his character and his ability to deliver the lines and timing is very well done. The same cannot be said for Jeanne Tripplehorn&apos;s character. She seemed to overact some scenes and others it seemed that she wasn&apos;t quite sure how to portray the character. At times, it almost made me feel uncomfortable trying to watch her find her role. James Caan did a very good job of playing the father and in some cases, he stole some scenes. The rest of the actors played their roles fairly well although many of these actors have been typecast as the mafia type character.\n\nAlthough the movie was fairly amusing, there were places that it seemed to drag a little bit. A sign of a good movie for me is how much my mind wanders and this did happen in some places. In my opinion it could have been even funnier but in general it was pretty good. Overall, I found it to be entertaining and genuinely funny...7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Netflix has been going all-in on original content over the last few years, but until recently that was primarily through long-form narrative shows (one story told over multiple episodes) and disposable Adam Sandler movies. The last six months has seen the streaming service giant make a big push into A-grade feature length work (Mudbound, Bright, Cloverfield Paradox, to name just a few), and this sprawling sci-fi is arguably their most intriguing prospect yet. With ambitious auteur Duncan Jones given free rein on what he has expressed as his passion project, having concocted the story with childhood friend and co-writer Michael Robert Johnson, there&apos;s zero chance of it being dull. And dull it most definitely isn&apos;t, the propulsive story-a man scours the grimy underbelly of a futuristic Berlin when his girlfriend goes missing-keeps the viewer on their toes whilst the gorgeous realisation of a Blade Runner-esque tech-future is a pure feast for thine eyes. But here&apos;s the catch: with a reluctance to explain almost anything about this world, or provide character motivation for anyone other than Alexander Skarsgård&apos;s silent bartender Leo, the plot can be complicated to the point of pretentious. There are a lot of little flourishes and subtle touches that colour this universe, although they would have meant so much more if the overall context was clearer. As it stands these unexplained moments become increasingly frustrating, threatening to derail the whole movie. His acting skills well and truly put to the test, Skarsgård is likable enough as the gentle giant on a mission; however, Paul Rudd is horribly miscast as a scumbag AWOL soldier, his persistent mean-spirited goading of others regularly veering into pantomime. There is clearly a lot of passion and ambition on display with Mute, but while for some it will be evocative and demanding, for others it will simply be pompous and impenetrable. For me it&apos;s somewhere in the middle with the scales tipping ever so slightly towards the latter.",

      "reviewBody": "After seeing this at the Galway Film Fleadh, I can honestly say that this film is a beautiful standout that deserves more than to be called the &quot;British Brokeback Mountain&quot;. While the comparisons between the two films were inevitable, God&apos;s Own Country offers different things than Ang Lee&apos;s classic. It speaks to more current issues of gay young men in a modern rural area, masterfully incorporating themes of identity issues, immigrant problems, and familial expectations. It&apos;s not a remake of the classic, it&apos;s an advancement of the genre that Brokeback Mountain helped define. \n\nThe most dazzling part of this film is the two young leads, Josh and Alec. It has been many, many years since I have seen a film where two individuals had as much chemistry between them, and the work that Josh and Alec put in to their character leaves the audience deeply and emotionally connected to both characters throughout the entirety of the movie. I could feel the lust between the two when they were on stage, and the heartbreak that happens when a fight occurs. The emotional performances by the two leads make the great movie even better. \n\nProps must also be given to Francis Lee-- as a first time director, this is not the movie we in the audience were expecting. It was as masterful, as poignant, and as beautiful as any established director could have done. It was an honor to watch this film, and I cannot wait to follow the career of the director-- after what he did here, I know much more greatness is on the way. \n\nI have not stopped thinking about this film for 3 days after I saw it. It won&apos;t leave me for a long time, because there is so much to thing about and so much to celebrate. I cannot wait to see it again, and I encourage you to see it as soon as you possibly can- - this is what independent cinema can look like when done masterfully!",

I&apos;ve been passionate about gay rights and issues ever since I knew what it was to be gay, and I had not one clue how horrible the AIDS epidemic was at its inception. The Normal Heart is an unflinching look at a horrific time in our history where human beings were treated by the masses as garbage. Literally. And that&apos;s when they were even being acknowledged at all. Every actor involved gave an Oscar-worthy performance, ironically in a movie that is not eligible for the award. Mark Ruffalo&apos;s passion jumps right out of the screen at you, and in both its most angry and its most devastating, you&apos;re right there with him. Julia Roberts gives an Erin Brockovich-like performance times ten. Jim Parsons is wonderful in the first role most of us are seeing him outside of Sheldon Cooper, both with his moments of humor and more importantly with his heart. Many kudos also to Taylor Kitsch, Joe Mantello, Alfred Molina, Finn Wittrock, and of course Ryan Murphy for his fearless and beautiful direction. But Matt Bomer... Matt Bomer is THE star among stars, pulling at every single one of your heartstrings in one of the bravest roles ever committed to film. This is without a doubt one of the most important movies you will ever see.",

      "reviewBody": "Emma Thompson returns from the 2005 film &quot;Nanny McPhee&quot; for the sequel as she reprises the titular character of the movie in &quot;Nanny McPhee Returns (formerly known as &quot;Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang&quot;. The first movie was surprisingly good and was it was a pleasure to watch the movie. Now, the second movie has a different tale and how about it? It was great.\n\nFirst, &quot;Nanny McPhee Returns&quot; is not set in a city but rather on the countryside. A mother who&apos;s husband is gone to war has three naughty children who helps her work in the farm. Suddenly, their cousins from the city had to stay with them for a while. Since they&apos;re environment is different, their way of living has to be different and so, they can&apos;t stand it and so trouble comes. With nothing else on hand, Nanny McPhee comes to the rescue to teach the children five lessons that would change their behavior forever.\n\nFrom flying motorcycles to swimming pigs, &quot;Nanny McPhee Returns&quot; was still able to keep the magic pumping up from the first movie. This movie has more magical things than the first movie. But, the first movie has a stricter Nanny McPhee than the first one and the first one (I think) gives Nanny McPhee a harder job to handle them rather than handling the kids in the second movie.\n\nEmma Thompson who previously portrayed Professor Trewlawney from the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series denied to reprise her role in the final installments and instead chose to reprise &quot;Nanny McPhee&quot; back to the screen. She was still able to repeat her solemn character in this movie. Although Thompson was a bit less in depth on her acting, her acting can still be praised.\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal plays the troubled mother who has been encountering endless problems in her life. Here, she uses British accents on her lines and her acting was perfect. Maggie Smith who also played Professor McGonagall in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series plays Mrs. Docherty who is a friend of Mrs. Green, the troubled mother. She plays in more of a funnier role than her previous ones and her acting was great, brilliant. The actors/actresses who played the naughty kids were also shockingly awesome. There&apos;s nothing wrong with the acting.\n\nThe special effects, the script and the cinematography were all stunning. The flying pigs scene was breathtaking and the script was perfectly written. The cinematography was not a problem at all. They were all mesmerizing.\n\nIn all, &quot;Nanny McPhee Returns&quot; is a good family adventure. It&apos;s still able to recreate the magic of the first film. It was brilliant and I recommend this to all families. I guarantee that most kids who see this film will try to see this film again. I had no regret watching this film. Overall, this movie gets 7 stars out of 10. Thanks for reading my review.",

The entire story, weak, the music, weak, I mean the opera setting with the opera music during the action scene was just horrible and down right annoying to say the least.

      "reviewBody": "Excellent Lloyd Webber-Rice musical is finally brought to the silver screen twenty years after the release of its concept album.  Being used to watching flashy, colourful musicals, namely from MGM, full of catchy tunes and full of breathtaking dance routines, &quot;Evita&quot; left me quite shocked.  It was the first (and last) &quot;political&quot; musical I saw.  The music impressed me at once, however the story and the setting did not quite do so at first sight.  It was only later, when I read something about the life story of Eva Peron did I really appreciate the excellent work Lloyd Webber and Rice did.  Even though they were not 100% faithful to the real story, the bio-musical gave a somewhat clear picture of what type of woman Eva Peron was.  The movie was great with its re-enactments of the 1940s-1950s Argentine elections, however, having personally performed in the stage version (playing a descamisado, a waiter, a policeman and one of Eva&apos;s lovers), I cannot but point out the several drawbacks it had.  It is true that the funeral, the electoral campaign and the terrorism were by far better on screen than on stage, yet the stage musical had a certain charm which was lost in the film. It could be due to the fact that on stage there was some dancing involved while the movie had none; it could be because one was live and one was playback; it could be because some of the harmonies were lost in the movie; it could be simply due to the fact that in one I participated while in the other I was just a spectator.  I don&apos;t know, still the stage version was more &quot;alive&quot;.  Nonetheless, in order to be fair, I have to admit that the movie version did have some improvements as regards to the play.  The best one of them was the song &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;. Apart from finally re-uniting composer and lyricist after more than 10 years of cold war, it presents the First Lady of Argentina as a woman who has some feelings, who is afraid in front of her approaching death, who is not only interested in becoming vice-president, as the stage production tends to hint. How much this is historically true is beyond me, yet it is good to give some human element to the heroine.\n\nI was quite impressed by the actors&apos; interpretations.  Madonna has finally showed the world that she is able to look great without taking her clothes off, that she is more than just voice, boobs and scandal.  Jonathan Pryce was excellent as the Argentine president - such a pity he had so little to sing, having such a great voice.  Antonio Banderas impressed me - I did not know he was that good at singing.  The role of the narrator was quite a breakthrough after his tough-guy&apos; parts, and he did it quite well.  Some critics said that this movie would set the way for future film versions of musicals - I hope they were right!",

A warm homemade meal.\n\nWhat I got was the Tuesday cafeteria special: a scoop of leftover mashed potatoes, and it landed right in the lima beans. It&apos;s food, but I didn&apos;t love eating it.\n\nCredit where it&apos;s due, Den 2 is shot well and sounds great. Better than the first. Some nifty heist hijinks were clever.\n\nBut the lazy writing, plot conveniences, flat characters, meaningless subplots, insufferable music score (near the end), and shoddy pacing sully much of the positives.\n\nThe first Den displayed constant tension as the cops brushed shoulders with the crooks in everyday situations, suspicion ever present. Here, there&apos;s hardly any friction, and when it&apos;s there, it&apos;s contrived.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, I&apos;d rather watch Ghost Protocol or Italian Job than a shallow, underwhelming imitation.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;South Park.&apos; What more needs to be said? If you aren&apos;t aware of the animated cartoon aimed at adults then you really should check it out. And, if you do (and you like it of course!), then you should then definitely check out &apos;Orgazmo.&apos; It&apos;s written and starring South Park&apos;s two creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone and the film could almost be described as a &apos;live action version of the cartoon.&apos; Basically, it&apos;s the same mixture of irreverent humour mixed with slapstick, f*rt jokes and a healthy dose of satire mixed with just enough heart to elevate it over your average &apos;gross out&apos; comedy flick.\n\nSo, just like South Park, the film opens mixing two of their favourite topics: adult circumstances and Mormons. We meet &apos;Joe&apos; – just your average Mormon (played by Trey Parker) who&apos;s going from door to door in Los Angeles trying to spread the &apos;good word.&apos; Now, he&apos;s well used to getting one door slammed in his face after the next. This is all just part of the life of a Mormon and he takes it with good grace, already affirming him as a decent – if only slightly annoying – character. However, he gets more than he bargains for when he knocks on the door of a house where an *ahem* &apos;adult&apos; movie is being filmed inside. And, through a complete coincidence, they&apos;re on the lookout for &apos;new talent.&apos; What follows is basically the story of a devote Mormon masquerading as a p*rn star. Now, that may be crazy enough, only they go one step further and transfer him into a crime fighting superhero who wields a ray-gun which, if hit by its beam, makes you er well, the clue is in the film&apos;s title.\n\nNow, &apos;Orgazmo&apos; may not be the funniest film and it may not be the most well-written. However, what it lacks when the jokes and/or plot fall a little flat is heart. You just can&apos;t help but love the characters themselves. The good is truly good and the bad guys are just crying out to be thwarted. You will need to be quite broad-minded when it comes to what sort of humour you find funny. I&apos;ve already mentioned the word &apos;adult&apos; when talking about this film – and for good reason. Basically, if you&apos;re a fan of South Park then you should love this film as much as I do. It&apos;ll never rise to the heights as it&apos;s animated cousin, but it&apos;s definitely a cult classic that deserves an hour and a half of your time.\n\nThe only drawback for me is that it&apos;s all Trey Parker and not enough of his co-creator Matt Stone. Stone is in it, but not enough for my liking (but what he does when he&apos;s there is typically awesome – and did I mention &apos;adult&apos; in nature?).",

All coked-up, and on the fly.. all these ideas come together in a stupid collection of out-there, and homicidal set-pieces. As every bit of machinery becomes demonically possessed, after a comet passes through the Earth&apos;s atmosphere. So no one is safe from the onslaught when the machines start a global crisis for blood.\n\nDirector Stephen King (who also makes an amusing cameo at the beginning) lines it up with dark humour, ripe performances and outrageous stunts. It&apos;s pure chaotic madness! I admit, I didn&apos;t find the second half to be as impressive when the action comes to a standstill at an isolated truck stop, but still, there are enough silly, bug-eyed decisions in the latter half to get your rocks off with the likes of Emilio Estevez and a rocket launcher packing Pat Hingle heading a motley crew against circling trucks led by a green goblin rig. Not to forget either the brutal encounters with a machine gun mounted mule and an electric knife. After such a cracking set-up, it&apos;s just too bad the film&apos;s final payoff isn&apos;t much of one. Also you can&apos;t go wrong with an electrifying AC/DC soundtrack, which doesn&apos;t wait around to kick in, by opening with the killer track &quot;Who Made Who&quot;? blaring away.",

Those where all films that require the viewer to participate, use their brain and have a good time.\n\nBrian De Palma is a master filmmaker. One that has been manipulating audiences for over the last 30 years. The opening of this film is brilliant, with nearly 25 minutes of no dialogue scenes. Yes, there are lines given off here and there as the jewel heist is prepared and executed(it is cool that the heist is the opener and not the climax of this story), but really it is like watching a silent film. The attention to detail in the opening and all through out is what makes the film great, you will watch this over and over and catch something new on each viewing.\n\nSome have argued that De Palma is not an autuer, but indeed he is. He has his trademark long one takes, with the camera gliding around to create a universe that is almost real but still we are aware we are watching fiction. There is the common theme of duel perceptions and persona&apos;s burning bright in this film, much like in Carrie, Dressed to Kill and Blow out. That theme is best illistrated by his use of split screen. Also the slow motion is used to perfection here at critical times, unlike Micheal Bay who uses it to make things look pretty.\n\nThis is a great film, yes, it takes some suspension of disbelief but that is why its a movie. If its your first De Palma venture you should check out his older thrillers, like Body Double and Blow out. He is a great movie maker that has influenced todays greats like David Fincher, Quinten Tarantino, Richard Kelly and P.T. Anderson in one way or another."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a little ambivalent about The Innkeepers, much as I was about Ti West&apos;s previous opus, The House of the Devil. Both films put nary a foot wrong on atmospheric or technical levels, both are backed up by solid little stories, yet for all their little pleasures neither really wowed me, as if not all their elements gelled, or perhaps they didn&apos;t go far enough. The Innkeepers has the advantage of simpler and far more forthcoming entertainment, making it an overall pleasurable ride, one that I may even revisit and enjoy more. Its a character rather than scare driven affair, focusing on Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy), last staff of the going out of business Yankee Pedlar inn, and later Leeanne Reece Jones (Kelly McGillis), ageing actress turned psychic. With adept performances from the three leads the characters portray a spectrum of vulnerable humanity, Claire quirky and likable, but asthmatic and somewhat mindful of her lack of direction, Luke a droll slacker slowly reaching that point where falls life and the weight of what could have been and Leeanne fully self aware but only a little bitter, of the three the most in possession of herself. It being the last night of the hotel customers are scarce so Claire and Luke set out to investigate the inn&apos;s alleged ghost, a girl who committed suicide whose body was hidden in the basement to avoid scandal. At first the tone is light, the characters trade off one another, there are jump scares played for light humour and the audience gets to be a part of the films little world. Later on though the laughs are dropped, as Claire and Luke get serious in their investigation and things get rather spooky, leading to a nicely jolting conclusion. Everything works here, yet it didn&apos;t really stir me until the final scenes. Its not the measured pace, not gripes with the plotting (which maintains plenty of pleasing ambiguity), more I guess the issue of things not really gelling together. The film is intentionally episodic, broken into three chapters and there isn&apos;t much flow between them other than the flow of plot. So the inspired humour, a sort of light and likable slacker vibe with several true to life moments, and the horror, mostly swift creepy jolts and some brooding atmosphere, never really feed each other in a manner fit to hold the film together and make it really effective, the two veins subvert each other quite nicely just not in a manner that works so well in the moment of the film itself. Still, I can see people liking this one a lot and its done pretty nicely on the critical circuit so I may be in a minority. Definitely check it out for yourself say I, its worth experiencing for yourself.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;I Love You, Beth Cooper&quot; opened with an extremely awkward scene, Denis (Paul Rust) confessing his love for Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere) during his valedictorian speech at his High School graduation. It was so awkward. I was so uncomfortable and embarrassed for him; it made me cringe. I didn&apos;t want to look but I just couldn&apos;t look away. The awkwardness was lightened with a few very funny remarks made during the speech. Luckily this was the only awkward humor. I don&apos;t think I would be able to handle a whole lot of that.\n\nMy favorite character was Rich Munsch played by newcomer Jack Carpenter. He was very funny with his random, homosexual comments then insisting he is not gay. Naturally I loved his movie references throughout the film.\n\n&quot;I Love You, Beth Cooper&quot; was very stupid but so very amusing. There were countless moments when I laughed out loud. There were hilarious moments such as a towel battle scene, a fight scene with Carpenter jumping out a window as means of escape, and a scene involving a terrifying raccoon.\n\nThough it was stupid and funny there were a lot of serious moments. The two main characters played by Rust and Panettiere did a lot of talking with their eyes. They understood personal and profound moments the other was going through. Oddly enough they had a great connection.\n\nThough the acting wasn&apos;t fantastic, it wasn&apos;t a downfall for the film.\n\nI am absolutely shocked to say this but I thoroughly enjoyed watching &quot;I Love You, Beth Cooper&quot;. I would recommend it for a good laugh.",

She gave the character some real depth, what appears to be a shallow girl on the surface, is a complex, thoughtful character.\n\nRather good, 6/10",

At least he wasn&apos;t one of those talk-first, shoot-maybe-later clichés from the world of film. The hockey scenes in here are realistic, too. However, the rest of the film doesn&apos;t exactly exhibit realism: lots of hokey stuff in here, too. At the end, the action really gets carried away and brings the rating down on this to a manageable &quot;7.&quot; Otherwise, it would be a minimum of &quot;8&quot; just for the entertainment value alone.\n\nAfter a slow start, it picks up when Boothe enters the movie. Then it never lets up. If you want a pure hour of action, this is it. There is no female lead in this movie, so you get no romance nor gratuitous sex scenes, which is a bit unusual. It&apos;s a straight crime story.\n\nOne note: unless things have been changed, I was disappointed my DVD did not offer a widescreen version.",

Mysterious characters, red herrings, things that could be linked together in a really cool way.\n\nHow naive and utterly wrong we were.\n\nThere is no point to this film. Literally, why was this film made? It&apos;s like they employed a really good writer for the first half of the film who put together a brilliant structure and then some idiot decided to take over and realised he/she was in over their head.  By the last shot I was honestly screaming &quot;DO NOT ROLL CREDITS&quot; and my sister had to restrain me when the goddam screen went black.\n\nThis review may seem extra, but I have never been so angry, frustrated and disappointed by a potentially great film.\n\nI urge you not to waste your time. \n\nI have to go cool off and try and forget the fact I ever watched this piece of rubbish.",

Pace is slow at times but the jokes in that in-between time are actually funny. Amy Schumer has a style of comedy that is not for all I guess; that might explain the negative reviews. But then there is this actor, Ike Barinholtz who kinda steals the show! He has some great moments. Don&apos;t take this movie seriously, and you will like it! Good for a lazy Sunday afternoon!",

      "reviewBody": "This documentary shines a very bright light on two fundamental issues going on in our country. The power of money and it&apos;s influence on profitable incarceration and ultimately perpetual slavery. I think it did a fabulous job of being virtually opinion free and making a point to stay focused on facts. That said, I think you have to be open to the information. By that, whether you lean right or left, it&apos;s best to digest this documentary with an open mind free of your own political thoughts and opinions. \n\nIt&apos;s foundation is about slavery and how it plays a role in modern events. It suggests that slavery never went away, it merely reinvented itself to &quot;keep up with the times&quot;, always having financial gain being the catalyst for it&apos;s continued existence. It really shines when it presents it&apos;s case on how mass incarceration is today&apos;s slavery. The direct correlation between labor based slavery of yesteryear and labor based incarceration of today is frightening in regards to similarity. You can deny it if you choose to, but if you continue to do so after seeing this presentation, then it&apos;s simply because you deny fact. \n\nWhen Colin Kaepernick protested the flag, though I&apos;m a black man, I was offended by his stance. After watching this documentary however, I look at his point of view with a different lens. I don&apos;t entirely agree with his approach, but I have to admit that oppression in this country is still very alive and well. I think too many people look at oppression in traditional views like slavery and the holocaust. But in my opinion, you have to appreciate oppression as the complexity that it is, in order to acknowledge it&apos;s existence. Again this documentary does an excellent job of making that case. I won&apos;t delve too deep into why, I would just simply recommend watching it.\n\nWord of caution however. This documentary doesn&apos;t pull it&apos;s punches. It&apos;s very dark, very disconcerting regarding politics and if it hits you right, it will make you angry and sad all at once. My two children stayed in the forefront of my mind while watching this, and my heart bled for them throughout, seeing what kind of world that awaits them. I tried to be optimistic about light being brought to this issue in such a well put together way, but I believe that we as a country, still have a ways to go, seeing that someone like Trump could get so close to being President. \n\nOverall, this documentary is very important and should be seen by everyone able. Whether you lean right or left, you cannot deny some of the dirty deals made by politicians to keep their pockets lined via profitable incarceration. Real change needs to happen without question, but this documentary drives home the point that as long as &quot;the almighty dollar&quot; rules, don&apos;t expect much change anytime soon.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Secret of My Success&apos; is classic 80&apos;s cinema, with an incredible performance by one of my favorite actors, M.J Fox. I remember the 80&apos;s euphoria, as I am an Indian, I lived in India... I remember Mithun dancing in his hit films, and loving him. M.J Fox was another kid-favorite. Watching this film, just makes me go back in time and jump! \n\n&apos;The Secret Of My Success&apos; is about M.J Fox, who comes to make it big in New York City, and then begins his youthful journey, which is FUN! The ambitious kid inside you, the confidence to conquerer the World, the believe, you become Brantley Foster from the very start. And the series of events he goes through are so memorable. I just love this film! \n\nHerbert Ross&apos;s direction is fantastic. Jim Cash&apos;s screenplay is full of fun! Carlo Di Palma&apos;s Cinematography, like always, is striking. Paul Hirsch&apos;s editing is crisp.\n\nM.J Fox is an Icon. I&apos;ve always loved him, be it this film, the Back To The Future series or Teen Wolf. He is a magical actor, who&apos;s simply lovable. Helen Slater is the only performer, who stands up to M.J Fox and delivers a very likable performance.\n\nOn the whole, This is simply, 80&apos;s and M.J Fox at their best! From this fan, Two Big Thumbs Up!",

Christian Slater dominates the screen as he does best; I only wish he was still leading man material instead of getting bit roles. I do admit there are times when you know what&apos;s going to happen before it does but you do still get some great surprises in there. I love the humor, there is a lot of it but they don&apos;t go over the top with it to where you can&apos;t take the movie serious. Big thumbs up for this underrated film. Love it!!"

This movie really surprised me in the fact that I was expecting a straight comedy. While this movie had its really funny moments its also dramatic throughout. An amazing cast helps tell the story of someone other then Mark Zuckerberg getting rich off the internet.

      "reviewBody": "As a man who really struggles with romcoms at the best of times, I was rather nervous about this. Actually, though, it steers clear of some (though not all) of the gay stereotypes and presents us with a genuinely quite funny love story about two forty-somethings who meet in a nightclub. One, &quot;Bobby&quot; (Billy Eichner) is a ordinary looking, gobby podcaster and activist who is trying to raise the money needed for an American National LGBTQ+ museum. The other is &quot;Aaron&quot; (Luke Macfarlane) - a lawyer who spends a fair amount of time on the cross-fit. They wouldn&apos;t appear to be the most natural of fits but a series of brief encounters on their opening night coupled with a fair degree of sarcasm and a kiss sets the tone for what happens next. Certainly, anyone who has a Dekkoo subscription will have seen the format before - and often, and this doesn&apos;t really vary the theme much. What does make this different is the characters have much more depth. Their relationship is never going to be straightforward and though sometimes delivered via annoyingly angry monologues, the character of &quot;Bobby&quot; makes some fairly profound and well reasoned arguments about the constraints history has imposed on people of differing sexualities over the years. Eichner is effective as a man who uses his sharp and pithy tongue to prove the best form of defence is attack, Macfarlane proves to be far more than the man with the muscle, and the writing from the former and director Nicholas Stoller clearly demonstrates that both men have skin in this particular game. Experience has clearly informed and fuelled this creative process. It can be a bit hit or miss, especially the third quarter when it all becomes a bit contrived, but the ending redeems it rather - if only for the pure schmaltz of the serenade - and I rather enjoyed it. It sure doesn&apos;t need a cinema screening, but it is entertainingly provocative at times. The BBFC slide at the top warned of &quot;strong sex&quot;. Clearly they have never watched &quot;Theo and Hugo&quot; (2016) because there is nothing at all visual in this that could conceivably cause offence; even the language is comparatively mild.",

And again a wonderful Belen Rueda as semi-blind woman in a movie with intense sequences of horror and suspense . The story deals with a mature woman named Julia (Belen Rueda in a double role) married a psychologist (Luis Homar) , she is slowly losing her vision by a degenerative ill whilst attempting to investigate the mysterious death of her twin sister named Sara (Belen Rueda) , also blind , who supposedly committed suicide . An old woman (Julia Gutierrez Caba) leads her to Baumann Center where Sara had relations to other blind women . Later on , finding alone in a house is terrorized by strange events . She is pursued by a psycho but can&apos;t hide in the dark . This is a highly suspenseful and cerebral mystery that tells about a woman losing his sight and being helped by his husband . It&apos;s a battle of wits between an intelligent almost blind woman and an evil villain and winds up pitting two rival, the obstinate blind woman and the brutal psycho against each other in order to save herself and destroy them both.\n\nThe film contains tension , thriller, drama , mystery , plot twists and shocks , including decent scares with tense terror sequences especially in its final part , in a creepy denouement , near of the end with a crazy killer trying to murder her . The picture is thrilling and some moment brilliant, and the actors are quite reliable as Belen Rueda , Luis Homar and special appearance by veteran Julia Gutierrez Caba . Although is sometimes slow moving and stagy , however is entertaining for continuous suspense . Belen Rueda is sensational in one of her best films along with ¨El Orfanato¨ .

      "reviewBody": "The low IMDb rating for MANNEQUIN is imbecilic. This is a thoroughly delightful mixture of madcap comedy and romance, played to the hilt by a sparkling cast of players who all have a gift for comedy.\n\nANDREW McCARTHY is at his best as a young man drifting from job to job who ends up employed by ESTELLE GETTY at her almost defunct department store. It isn&apos;t until he gets real inspiration for window displays from a mannequin who becomes a real person whenever others aren&apos;t around, that the picture soars into romantic fantasy. KIM CATTRALL is the gorgeous dummy who comes to life and wins the heart of the hero who is at first reluctant to believe his own eyes.\n\nThe sets and costumes are fantastic, the supporting cast is excellent and the script stays in high gear until the last twenty minutes when things get a little too hectic, even for a comedy/fantasy. But it&apos;s all in good fun, a cheerful flick easily enjoyable if you like fantasies of this kind and all of it is well photographed in pleasing color with splendid sets.\n\nANDREW McCARTHY, KIM CATTRALL, JAMES SPADER (especially funny as a smarmy business man), and G.W. BAILEY (as the night detective) all demonstrate a flair for comedy in roles they obviously enjoyed playing.\n\nWell worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;After the Wedding&quot; (2006) begins on the streets of Mumbai, India, where several orphaned, homeless children are queuing up for food, courtesy &apos;Anand Orphanage and School&apos;, assisted by Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) who has taken up the cause. He teaches in the school attached to the orphanage, and is a favorite with the children there. The initial scenes make one wonder if this is yet another &apos;poverty porn&apos; focusing only on the dirty underbelly of India and projecting it to be a country worse than it actually is (Think &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;). But any negativity formed in the beginning is quickly quashed with what follows.\n\nThe orphanage is clearly falling short of funds. A silver lining is seen, as some tycoon in Denmark, by the name of Jorgen Hansson (Rolf Lassgård), has agreed to offer a huge sum of money as donation to the orphanage, but only on the condition that Jacob travel to Denmark personally, meet with Jorgen and then return with the necessary funds and paperwork. This tiny detail offered in the beginning, highlights the whimsical nature of the wealthy businessman&apos;s offer, and immediately hints at a catch, so we begin to brace ourselves for an early twist. Any surprise quotient, then, is automatically reduced to half.\n\nJacob travels to Denmark, leaving behind his shanty life, albeit promising one of the orphan boys, Pramod (Neeral Mulchandani), who he has brought up and loves like his son, that he would be back in a week. Once in Denmark, Jacob is given red carpet treatment; a personal airport pickup, a luxury suite in a posh hotel, and later a meeting with the man himself; who takes a look at the project put together by Jacob (a videotape detailing the activities of the orphanage), but seems to be more interested in having a drink with him. Jorgen turns off the tape halfway, leaving Jacob stumped and disappointed, but proceeds to invite Jacob to the upcoming wedding of his daughter Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen). The unsuspecting Jacob accepts the invitation and shows up at Jorgen&apos;s plush mansion, the venue of the wedding.\n\nBut a series of startling discoveries at the wedding and after it, make this visit to Denmark, a life-changing experience for Jacob..\n\nWriter-Director Susanne Bier&apos;s screenplay shows great promise, at least in the first half, thanks to the periodic revelations. Some dark secrets are revealed at regular intervals, and thus the pace is well maintained &apos;til then, although the film revolves only around four major characters. There are great moments of power-packed drama, sometimes intense, sometimes warm, sometimes awkward; mostly the uncomfortable encounters between characters are very naturally captured; it couldn&apos;t get more real than that. The director knows exactly how the characters would emote under the circumstances, and thanks to the terrific actors, it&apos;s all well done and earnestly acted. The cinematography is somewhat grainy, mostly devoid of the usage of special lighting, and is shot on a hand-held camera, reminiscent of the style of the Dogme 95 movement first initiated by Lars Von Trier. It is no surprise that the filming of the entire wedding sequence very much reminds of that in Von Trier&apos;s &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot;.\n\nIt is the extreme close-ups of eyes, lips, hands, and even some facial hair that come across as an eyesore. There are way too many close-ups that just weren&apos;t required and suit neither the genre, nor the subject matter. In fact they take away from the scenes somewhat, by not showing us the visage of the actor during a scene, when his/her reaction or emotion is vital to the scene. It is in the latter half, that the drama begins to shed the subtlety, when the most important twist of the story is revealed, and the film dips into mawkish melodrama giving rise to histrionics and gawky over-sentimentality! The major twist is itself a cliché and a bankable ingredient for a weepy soap opera. But there are other events that follow, and at such timings, that you can&apos;t help but think that the screenplay is taking an emotionally manipulative direction, by forcing some events that just weren&apos;t necessary, but used merely because they, somehow, serve as good excuses to make the proceedings sappier! \n\nThat said, it is indeed noteworthy, how almost all the characters are very well written; they have a lot of depth and more importantly, the initial impression that is created about them, takes a drastic turn in some key events, and we are forced to see them in a different light. Of course, the convincing dynamics of the characters, are owing to the choice of actors that are immensely talented. Mads Mikkelsen brings a range of emotions to the otherwise stoic Jacob who is taken aback when he first learns of the shattering truth that hits like a bolt of lightning. Ditto for the mixed emotions and the inevitable awkwardness he displays, later, in one of the best directed scenes of the film. Rolf Lassgård is brilliant as the drunk, but loving father and business tycoon, whose real intentions, and hence the kind of person he is, becomes clear only later. Stine Fischer Christensen is cute and does a commendable job as the daughter Anna who gets a double whammy of deceit. And then we have Sidse Babett Knudsen as Helene, who finds herself in an extraordinary situation, by a twist of fate, following a seemingly strange coincidence, and a past that refuses to let go. It is a classy performance indeed.\n\nWhat &quot;After the Wedding&quot; needed was a steady grip and restrained tone, that it maintains in the first half of the film, despite the plot contrivances, after which it nosedives into unnecessary melodrama and starts to come undone. Too bad, really! \n\nScore: 7/10",

      "name": "A Brilliant Film - Fun and Multi-Layered",
      "reviewBody": "Adapted from an off-Broadway show, &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; is the end result of 6 years of character and idea evolution by creator John Cameron Mitchell.  Equal parts musical, mockumentary, and drama, the film pleases on all levels.\n\nThe film&apos;s musical numbers are brilliantly crafted and cross several different genres.  A country-flavored number, &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot;, appears smack-dab in the middle of all the punk and glam rock tunes, daring anyone to doubt the soundtrack&apos;s variety.  The majority of the songs are catchy and great fun to listen to (&quot;Wig in a Box&quot; even has a karaoke sing-a-long during the second chorus), while staying true to the themes of the movie and Hedwig&apos;s life.  John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig) sings live vocals over a pre-recorded band mix, and this definitely lends more of a live concert feel than if he had simply lip-synched all the songs for the role.  The majority of the cast is reunited from the original cast of the &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; play, so fans of the original play who have not seen the movie need not worry about &quot;outsiders&quot; ruining it in transition.\n\nThe film&apos;s mockumentary nature mainly results from how the songs, being &quot;autobiographical&quot;, are preceded by scenes of commentary by Hedwig and a flashback from her life.  While the transition from real time to flashback is usually made quite clear, some scenes (particularly the climax, which is a mess trying to piece together) are confusing as to what is real and what is flashback.  The rest of the mockumentary comes between musical sequences, during Hedwig&apos;s interaction with her manager, band, and showing of mixed feelings towards Tommy Gnosis, an ex-lover who stole all her material for his own album and is now a popular teen idol.  Her interactions with husband Yitzhak (who, due to an excellent make-up job and performance by original cast member Miriam Shor, I had no idea was played by a woman until I saw &quot;Like It or Not&quot;, a documentary on the film included on the DVD)  would have made the list as well, had a vital character-development scene with Yitzhak (the only non-Hedwig flashback in the entire movie) been left in the final cut; as it is, Yitzhak serves only as Hedwig&apos;s back-up singer and whipping boy, a much less important character.  Most of the film&apos;s situations, however, are explained well, via flashback or dialogue, and have well-written gay and transsexual jokes.\n\nUnderneath all the humor and the music, however, is the serious theme of feeling spiritually &quot;whole&quot;.  Hedwig seems to interpret this (through the song &quot;Origin of Love&quot; and some interesting animated vignettes) as through finding love and one&apos;s soul-mate.  Mitchell, who knows his character better than anyone, gives an amazing performance and is not only able to portray Hedwig&apos;s bitchy diva side, but also able to make the audience sympathize with why she acts that way (unlike real-life divas), and how deeply her inner feelings and her failures so far at &quot;becoming whole&quot; through a relationship trouble her.\n\nHaving not even the faintest idea of what the film was about other than that it was a musical, I was very pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had with Hedwig, and how at the same time it never strayed far from its serious theme.  In its journey from a character, to a play, to a movie, &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; has won over audiences as well as taken home accolades at Sundance, but has not had much mainstream success (chalk this up to its &quot;controversial&quot; transsexual main character and the popularity of &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, an experiment in stylistic over-extravagance, which is bigger and flashier than &quot;Hedwig&quot; due to its grand budget but lacks the sense of &quot;genuine&quot; emotion in the plot).  This is quite tragic, because in retrospect, &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; was definitely one of 2001&apos;s best films.",

      "reviewBody": "While it is clear that The Spierig Brothers are familiar with all the haunted house horror story conventions, they, like Rob Zombie before them, do not seem to be able to effectively use them. A fondness for the genre does not translate into the ability to engage and frighten an audience. \n\nBefore anyone dismisses my review as being from someone who doesn&apos;t enjoy deliberately paced, creepy stories without a plethora of pyrotechnics, let me state that The Haunting (the original not the crappy remake) and 1944&apos;s The Uninvited are two of my favorite films. You don&apos;t need a large budget or special effects to make a scary film on the subject of a haunted house. Both Insidious and Sinister demonstrated that with good direction and a decent story you can scare the hell out of an audience.\n\nWhile Winchester boasts some good actors and a wonderful setting that is fraught with possibilities, it squanders both on a tired story of ghosts looking for revenge, which completely ignores the real facts of the Winchester House. A couple jump scares accompanied by sudden music stings work to a degree, but there is no genuine feeling of suspense generated by the script, no growing sense of escalating dread. Instead we get acceptable performances and some nice looking sets as the actors go through their paces to little effect.\n\nIt&apos;s not a terrible film, but one which fails to raise the hackles and which you will quickly forget after leaving the theater.",

      "reviewBody": "Rodney Dangerfield (RIP) has got a specific and recognizable sense of humor. Some like it , some not . I happen to like it , so I also liked &quot;Back to school&quot; . The whole movie is basically Dangerfield&apos;s tour de force . He&apos;s almost constantly making a snappy comments or fun jokes. He&apos;s rarely not on the screen. This doesn&apos;t mean the movie not offers him support.\n\nSam Kinison is fun as professor Terguson history teacher . The first lesson of history of America is HILARIOUS . I was crying from laughter. I wish they give him more screen time. I was surprised by appearance of young Robert Downey Jr. as Derek . He&apos;s quite a colorful character with his weird clothes , hairstyles and beliefs. I also loved Burt Young (Paulie from &quot;Rocky&quot;) as Lou - Thornton&apos;s driver and best friend. His strong and street wise. \n\nPaxton Whitehead (Philip Barbay) makes for a nice snobbish economy teacher. Keith Gordon is likable as shy Jason Melon – Dangerfield&apos;s son. Sally Kellerman (Diane) and Terry Farell (Valerie) are both lovely ladies. M. Emmett Walsh plays coach Turnbull . William Zabka (the bully from &quot;Karate kid&quot;) once again plays bully (Chas). There is also special guest appearance, but I won&apos;t spoil the surprise. \n\nThere are some great songs here : Jude Cole &quot;Back to school&quot; , Oingo Boingo &quot;Dead man&apos;s party&quot; , Aretha Franklin &quot;Respect&quot; and Rodney Dangerfield&apos;s version of &quot;Twist and shout&quot; .\n\nHarold Ramis (&quot;Groundhog day&quot; , &quot;National lampoons vacation&quot; , &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;) is one of the writers . He and Dangerfield worked earlier together in &quot;Caddyshack&quot; . There is even a picture from &quot;Caddyshack&quot; in the opening credits of the movie.\n\nThis is Dangerfield&apos;s best movie from the 80&apos;s and best overall. It&apos;s one of best 80&apos;s comedies. It was one of the first comedies to earn 100 millions worldwide . That tells you something. Oh , and don&apos;t forget about the famous jump at the pool.\n\nI give it 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Walt Disney&apos;s &quot;The Rookie&quot; is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former minor league picher who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history, ending an almost 10 year retirement and making his Major League debut in 1999 at the age of 35.\n\nThe film opens with a brief synopsis of Morris&apos; childhood, which included a series of re-locations - his father was a military man. And even when his family settled for good in football crazed Texas, Morris&apos; passion for baseball remained strong.\n\nThe childhood segment then jumps ahead about 23 years to the adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid) who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (in real life it was Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas). It is mentioned that he attempted a career as a baseball player but that it didn&apos;t work out.\n\nMorris&apos;s team is struggling and he lectures them about giving up on their dreams. They turn the table on him, telling him that he should try out for a Major League team. At several times when he pitches to them in practice, they express amazement at the speed with which he throws. Morris seems unconvinced but agrees to a deal with his players in which if they win district, he will try out for a Major League team.\n\nBig Lake does win district and, adhering to his end of the deal, Morris attends a Tampa Bay Devil Rays try out. Phenomenally, he throws 98 miles an hour - faster than he threw during his minor league career and an outstanding speed even for a Major League pitcher. After another try out with the team, Morris is offered a contract with the Devil Rays.\n\nThis leaves him with a tough decision - stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue his Major League dream by going through the minor league grind of making little money and spending months at a time away from home. And the decision is even more agonizing than during his first minor league stint because he now has a wife and three children.\n\nMorris signs with the Devil Rays, begins at the AA level and moves up quickly to the AAA level, one level below Major League Baseball. But as the season winds down, the chances of him getting &quot;called up&quot; grow increasingly slim.\n\nFor the most part, I love this movie. There are lots of great performances and likable characters and it&apos;s easy to find yourself really pulling for Morris. Also, the movie does a great job portraying professional baseball at both the major and minor league levels. And most of all, it teaches the timeless message of holding tight to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve.\n\nStill, the movie has some flaws. While generally accurate, it exaggerates and even fabricates a few things. Check out http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. Also, except for one scene in which he prays with his players, the movie completely ignores Morris&apos; Christian faith. But considering Disney&apos;s left wing zeal, that&apos;s not surprising.\n\nPresumably, a lot of the exaggerations/fabrications were done to make the story more dramatic. Yet the 20 minute documentary on Morris that is included on the DVD features some information that makes his story more dramatic but is excluded from the movie.\n\nFor example, from birth until his family settled in Texas for good when he was 12, Morris re-located 14 times. And his initial minor league career ended after four surgeries through which he lost half of the muscle in his left (pitching) shoulder, thus making his throwing 98 mph even more inexplicable.\n\nTo fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it&apos;s good to not only watch &quot;The Rookie&quot; but to watch the DVD&apos;s documentary, check out the aforementioned link to the movie&apos;s inaccuracies and probably also to read Morris&apos; biography, also titled &quot;The Rookie.&quot; I haven&apos;t read the book but I hope to one of these days.\n\nBut overall, &quot;The Rookie&quot; is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Ritchie Valens was a young,vibrant rock and roll star.At 17,he could already write songs,sing,and was an absolute wizard with a guitar.I&apos;m too young to remember the real Valens,but when I think of him,as well as other stars who died tragically young,I can&apos;t help but wonder what might have been.This young man was only getting started in his stardom when he was cut down all too soon in the same plane crash that claimed the lives of Buddy Holly and The Big Bopper.This film did a great job of bringing the legend of Valens back to life if only for a couple of hours.Lou Diamond Phillips gave the performance of his career here,as Valens,even though he didn&apos;t really look much like the real man in my opinion.Being the role he is best known for,I&apos;m sure it is also one he has tried to escape from in the 15 years since its&apos; release.As far as historical accuracy,I have heard discrepancies as to how the story really went,but you know Hollywood,things always have to be spiced up just a little.Overall,this movie is great fun,especially for old rock and roll enthusiasts such as myself.Thumbs up!",

      "reviewBody": "After reading the fantastic reviews and hearing from friends what a great film this was, i went in with big expectations. I was, oddly not to my surprise, a bit let down, and i think others will be too. But that doesn&apos;t mean that you shouldn&apos;t go out and watch it!\n\nHarboe is the perfect choice for the titular character - every emotion is portrayed with the utmost of believability. Her connection with Anja feels natural and at times entrancing. If Harboe doesn&apos;t win an Amanda for Best Actress i&apos;ll boycott the award show. Just saying... \n\nThe story in engaging, but slow-paced. I don&apos;t mind, others might. This is a beautiful piece of art, executed with finesse by Trier. The soundtrack is underscoring the action without adding too much drama, and you&apos;ve gotta love every moment Susanne Sundfør&apos;s music is playing in the background. A perfect fit for this film. The screenplay has a lot of potential, but stumbles here and there. In a way i wish it had been a bit easier on the use of metaphors and symbolism, but at the same time i can&apos;t quite grasp what Thelma really is about. Visually, it&apos;s stunning - and that&apos;s not a given for Norwegian film. But film needs more than stunning photography, cinematography, characters, cgi and music. And that last bit is what&apos;s missing here.\n\nSummed up: if you don&apos;t like Trier&apos;s other films, you might not like this one either. But it&apos;s worth the money (!) and your time. Film er best på kino!",

Tina Fey is fun as the prison guard in a Russian gulag where the real Kermit has been sent to.\n\nTy Burrell is Interpol Inspector Napoleon, co investigating with CIA agent Sam the Eagle while at the same time poking fun at French stereotypes.\n\nThere are many cameos some are blink and you miss them ranging from James McAvoy, Lady Gaga, Christoph Waltz, Frank Langella, Ray Liotta, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek and Tom Hiddleston.\n\nThe film is fun enough, a solid and enjoyable film with a good musical number (The Gulag Song) near the end of the film. Its not as good as The Muppets and borrows from earlier films such as The Great Muppet Caper. Then again the film acknowledges that sequels are not as good as the original film in its opening number. Jason Segel&apos;s absence is felt in this film and it also does feel a little bit flabby here and there.",

This film will do more to make the straight world understand and appreciate that there is another lifestyle that is not all sex, and weirdos. A far better look at a &quot;Gay love story&quot; than Brokeback mountain could ever hope to be.

      "reviewBody": "Went in with big expectations as a fan of Liu Cixin&apos;s Three Body Problem. Have not read Wandering Earth, so can&apos;t compare, but perhaps reading it would have made the movie easier to follow. Outside of Wu Jing, the main characters in general were hard to like, especially his son Liu Qi and adopted daughter, Duoduo, both acting like petulant children. Expected high levels of cheesiness, but the jokes fell flat and the emotional tear jerking scenes were milked dry. While you should go into a sci-fi with an open-mind, temporarily suspending reality, this had hole after hole and jumped all over the place. At one point, one of the special force team members suddenly fell on his face - he froze to death for no apparent reason. Kind of summed up the movie. While I am sure the novel is as unique as anything Liu Cixin has written, the movie is a lesser version of Armegeddon, lacking the fun, character building (I know, I am talking about a Michael Bay movie) and star power. Did enjoy seeing a Chinese perspective and wasn&apos;t overly nationalistic like Wu Jing&apos;s former Wolf Warrior. Living in Shanghai, was also fun seeing the city and the rest of the country highlighted as it fell beneath natural disasters, joining NYC, Paris, London and the rest of the major cities that regularly are destroyed for popcorn munching sake. China continues to head in the right direction when it comes to great movie making and hope it continues. If anything, this has me heading out tomorrow to buy Wandering Earth, the novel.",

While I&apos;m glad I watched it, I would say it fell short of my expectations. The storyline is average and in parts a little messy. Some of the chemistry between characters feels a little too forced tho this could be down to how the script has been written rather than the actors capabilities. There was definitely atleast one scene I didn&apos;t feel worked at all and was a poor choice when written for the direction they wanted the storyline to go.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t say this movie was absolutely awful, the actors do a great job in their respective roles with Joey King probably giving the best performance of the main leads. The ending was a little predictable and I could see where it was going to end up ahead of time. Not the worst watch, an average rom com at best. For me it wasn&apos;t enjoyable or memorable enough to make me want to rewatch in future so this will likely be a one time viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "Wallace &amp; Gromit are back... and so is Feathers McGraw. That&apos;s probably enough for any viewer. Many might wonder is this going to be as good as The Wrong Trousers. The answer is no, but it&apos;s not far off and really only falls short because it&apos;s a sequel. It&apos;s near impossible to capture the magic of anything as much loved as The Wrong Trousers, even though that was a sequel of sorts. The pairs house has had some upgrades. Wallace&apos;s new wake up routine is genius. Not that long suffering Gromit is impressed. He&apos;s happy with the simple life. The Pat-o-Matic for instance isn&apos;t to his taste. He&apos;d much rather have a nice pat on the head from Wallace. Wallace&apos;s latest invention though is for Gromit, to help him in the garden. A smart gnome called Norbot, who instead of helping, ruins Gromit&apos;s garden, invading his only sanctuary. The neighbours though are impressed and this kicks off Wallaces scheme to solve their money troubles, Gnome Improvements. What about the penguin you may ask? Well he&apos;s doing time at the zoo, but upon hearing of his foe&apos;s latest invention. He finds a way to hack Norbot, change his settings to &apos;Evil&apos; and have him create an army of evil gnome clones. They first terrorise the neighbourhood, besmirch Wallace&apos;s good name, help Feathers break out of the zoo and steal the blue diamond that alludes him in The Wring Trousers. The details are delightful. The animation is beautiful. The story first class and the action both gripping and wonderfully cinematic. So no it&apos;s not as jaw dropping and perfect as The Wrong Trousers, but it doesn&apos;t need to be. It&apos;s just as much fun and it&apos;s a joy to have a new adventure to enjoy over and over again.",

And even if you have seen the 1971 original, not everyone can remember all the details - at least I couldn&apos;t. (I think there is just about two or three movies about Jesus, and nobody cares about the remakes). Stallone is out to take vengance on the murderers of his brother, a decent barman working to support his family. The story takes place in seattle, and as you can imagine, there are a couple of shootings, car chases and so on. But that&apos;s not the movie. The movie is the fight from a bad guy against the bad guys to get justice for someone who didn&apos;t do anything wrong. The movie has an extraordinary visual quality, the titles and the music are worth seeing and hearing this movie. And one very seldom quality at the end: This movie is not to long. Get Carter! 7 of 10!"

The mayor downside being that all through the movie you have the feeling that you have seen this all before. The setting, humor and interaction does remind you of &quot;The Mask Of Zorro&quot; (best example being the horse). The storyline is not that interesting and gives you the idea that it has just been written to create the setting and atmosphere. The acting is also no Oscar material but is very adequate. So it doesn&apos;t quite sound like a must see movie.\n\nThen why should you see this one? I can&apos;t put my finger on it but somehow the whole package seems to work. Of course as a healthy guy I have to say that Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz as main attractions do raise my interest. Furthermore Steve Zahn has always had my sympathy as he always seems to be able to be much more than likable in the parts he plays. And finally, the directors come up with one or two original gags and camera shots that at least I hadn&apos;t seen before.\n\nThis is not Oscar material, but if you want to spend a comfortable hour and a half watching a movie this one will suit you fine.",

That doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that it&apos;s good; just that I like watching it.\n\nI highly recommend this movie to anyone searching for a good fantasy title from the 80&apos;s. I would put &quot;Krull&quot; right up there with Ladyhawke, both Conan&apos;s, Willow, and the Dark Crystal. \n\nWhat separates this fantasy film from the others is a plot involving a more science fiction- type element. Visitors from somewhere in space have landed on a planet named Krull to wreak havoc. After they snag up our hero, Prince Colwyn&apos;s bride-to-be, he goes on a quest to save her with the help of a star-shaped boomerang with knives called the Glaive and a band of strange characters including a cyclops and a goofy guy who can change into animals.\n\nGood time fun worth the rental price. What else do you need here?\n\nFor film buffs, check out early performances by Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane.",

      "reviewBody": "What images are conjured up by the title! Especially when we know in advance the lead is to be played by the handsome Johnny Depp. Perhaps a likable rake, a dissolute, even fashionable but very colourful icon of male supremacy - to be forgiven by female fans if they can watch from the safety of a cinema seat!\n\nThe reality is a disturbingly different film, dark and sombre, a 17th century candle-lit England, a portrait of the poet and debauchee John Wilmot, and one that ultimately bows out to a feminist heroine in the form of the great actress Elizabeth Barry (played by Samantha Morton).\n\nIn an opening prologue, Wilmot tells the audience that they will not like him. With the gusto characteristic of Depp, he throws himself into his melodramatic character in a way that is markedly different from his many half-serious, half-comic roles. As if to win his wager, he is out to repulse us - but not just with licentious excess: the tragedy of Wilmot is that he possesses genius but is unable to use it to furnish his own fulfilment. He is a tragic character, no Don Juan that follows a promiscuous lifestyle as a summum bonum, but a man of inner greatness for whom the outer world is so boring that he loses himself in drink and sexual excess and eventually alienates those around him. &quot;I have to speak my mind,&quot; he says, &quot;for it is always more interesting than what is going on around me.&quot;\n\nAs the 2nd Earl of Rochester, Wilmot is in and out of favour at the court of Charles II (John Malkovitch) and frequently upsets his lovely wife (Rosamund Pike) with his whoring and drinking. But his wife&apos;s jealousy is eventually piqued not so much by the loose women or the ale-house, but by Wilmot&apos;s love of the theatre - especially in the form of prostitute-destined-for-greatness, Elizabeth Barry. At a time before the emancipation of women, when the stage had recently been the sole province of men, Barry is determined to make it as an actress. She is hobbled by inexperience and a lowly position, but Wilmot takes her under his patronage and tutelage. Wary of the deal, Barry resists, saying she wants to rise by her own efforts - not so Wilmot can take the credit! He asks her what drives her, and her response, her passion for theatre, the desire to thrill and move an audience, is one that Wilmot identifies with, for he is tired of the lukewarm pastiches that trivialise even great writing.\n\nUnfortunately for Wilmot, his own greatness is on the ebb. It was said of him that he was, &quot;A man whom the muses were fond to inspire, but ashamed to avow.&quot; His taunting of the king and a scurrilous lampoon of Charles II in front of the French ambassador help to seal his fate. \n\nSamantha Morton continues to show her acting talents with a substantial (if not substantial enough) part and Malkovitch is an adequate counterbalance to the very considerable stage presence of Depp. The screenplay (based on an earlier play starring Malkovitch) sparkles with wit and, even if the direction is a little uneven or turgid at times, it is an admirable and important debut from Laurence Dunmore. The desaturated colours and muddy, rain-sodden English countryside create an air of foreboding entirely appropriate for a work that is more serious than its title suggests.\n\nIntellectually, we are treated to the drollness and intelligence of Wilmot but realise that he is a &apos;locked-in&apos; and isolated character, a loner and barely appreciated trailblazer (in some respects like the great Marlon Brando to whose memory, among others, the film is dedicated). We also see the folly and weakness of his philosophy. \n\nWilmot wrote:\n\n&quot;Consider real Honour then, You&apos;ll find hers cannot be the same; &apos;Tis noble confidence in men, In women, mean, mistrustful shame.&quot;\n\nYet it was the honour of the lowly Elizabeth Barry that ultimately inspired him and, somehow, remained ever out of reach.",

It&apos;s well-produced and cinematized with realistic acting by all. It has the necessary focus but still leaves room for individual interpretation, the sort of film that you can watch multiple times, picking up new details and subtleties with each view. At times it seems pro-Christian, at times anti-Christian, or at least critical of the superstitious-fundamentalist brand of Christianity. Again, the religious elements are clear enough yet also vague enough.\n\nThe plot does drag and meander a good bit. There are also some of the usual tired old demon-tropes (people throwing up black goop, etc). Still,this film has a fairly solid mythos behind it and relies more on surprise and suspense than it does raw schlock. While nothing truly special, 6 SOULS is probably worth seeing if you like psychological/supernatural horror and have been disappointed by most other recent films in this genre.\n\nThe ending leaves room for an interesting sequel. . .7 SOULS?",

Immediately Sarah has made two foes, the head-mistress and founder Miss Minchin and Livinia the school bully. Miss Minchin doesn&apos;t like Sarah because Sarah is imaginative and smart. Livinia doesn&apos;t like Sarah because she is a threat to her popularity. When a tragic problem arises Sarah is reduced to a servant girl her friends show her that she doesn&apos;t need to give up on life. This movie is wonderfully heart touching with a great ending.

It&apos;s for those who believe that love is about sacrifice and commitment, not consumption and convenience. It&apos;s for the ones who believe that there is someone out there for them.\n\n A Walk In the Clouds talks about the importance of family, belonging, and love, love even for the imperfect parent who doesn&apos;t know how to show love back.  And that is something no cynic dares confront seriously.  I see a little bit of the characters in the people I know around me.  That&apos;s the mark of a good movie."

      "name": "Slow out of the gate, but finds its groove as a comedy eventually",
      "reviewBody": "Fast cars and comedy have never really gone hand in hand. Movies such as the &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; franchise have always been about the cars, with the jokes mostly sticking to characters digging at each other and one-liners. &quot;Hit and Run,&quot; on the other hand, is all about the humor — with a side of car porn.\n\n&quot;Hit and Run&quot; serves predominantly as a showcase for the comedic style of its creator, actor Dax Shepard. Shepard&apos;s filmmaking debut, &quot;Brother&apos;s Justice,&quot; which he also co-directed with partner David Palmer in 2010, went silently, but here he&apos;s convinced his fiancée, Kristen Bell, to co-star and snagged another A-lister in Bradley Cooper to elevate the film&apos;s profile.\n\nThe humor in &quot;Hit and Run&quot; can best be described as awkward. It&apos;s a lot like &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; in the way it constantly steps back to let the characters verbally break down the event, action or tension that just happened or is happening on screen, only Shepard is less concerned with social taboos and all the characters of &quot;Hit and Run&quot; are a little mentally off in one way or another outside of the central couple.\n\nShepard plays Charlie Bronson, only that&apos;s not his real name. He lives somewhere in hard-to- find California because he&apos;s in Witness Protection after testifying against some bank robbers a few years back. Since then he&apos;s started a new life and a serious romance with Annie (Bell), who doesn&apos;t know much about his past. When Annie gets an incredible and nearly shoo-in dream job opportunity in Los Angeles — the city Charlie must specifically stay away from — he decides to risk taking her there.\n\nSetting it all in motion is a small contrivance: Annie needs to bring her teaching certificate, which she left in a photo album at her ex-boyfriend, Gil&apos;s (Michael Rosenbaum), house. Gil is still obsessed with Annie and convinced Charlie&apos;s a rapist of some kind because of his shrouded past. Ultimately, he discovers Charlie&apos;s real identity and in hopes of getting Annie back, contacts the very people Charlie must hide from, including Alexander Dmitri, a dreadlocked Cooper with an attitude problem.\n\nIt takes some time for all this to build, during which we&apos;re treated to a lot of weirdness. Tom Arnold plays Randy, the incompetent U.S. marshal assigned to protect Charlie who must then take off after him when he leaves town, and to call him a klutz would be a gross understatement. He&apos;s a running punch line in the film, which is fitting because Arnold is sort of a running punch line, but as you&apos;re waiting for the tension to ratchet up in the movie, he&apos;s frustratingly flattening it.\n\nThe slow first half of the film will immediately disappoint anyone looking for something high octane with lots of speeding cars and action. There&apos;s plenty of spinning out, chasing and wrecks, plus peeks under the hood for bona fide car nerds, but this isn&apos;t an action movie.\n\nEventually, Shepard&apos;s style finds its groove in the chaos of Randy, Gil and Charlie&apos;s old gang chasing after him. The characters arguing over trivialities, namely calling each other out on the dumb (and typically violent) stuff they do, works better in contrast with tension and suspense because it becomes less predictable. Before the story really gets going, the humor feels forced and anecdotal because we&apos;re just waiting for Alexander to find out about Charlie and go after him. The script in this sense could&apos;ve used a veteran writer&apos;s assistance to help the plot hit the ground running. \n\nAdmirably, the core of the story is way these events test the romance between Charlie and Annie. Shepard and Bell&apos;s real-life chemistry is apparent on screen and the slow beginning includes plenty of legwork to make them people you want to root for. When Annie finally learns exactly who Charlie was and freaks out over it, the two have a very legitimate and believable argument and we yearn for that problem to be resolved, even if the other characters and elements of the film are too borderline psychotic for things to end up any way but happy or in complete ruin.\n\nWith the number of oddball supporting characters, random violence, car porn and plenty of meta-talk about relationships, the overall tone of &quot;Hit and Run&quot; is ironic. The soundtrack is probably the best example, as it includes Lou Rawls&apos; recording of &quot;Pure Imagination&quot; from &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; during a car chase sequence, and the film ends with &quot;Let My Love Open the Door,&quot; which has no place in a film unless you&apos;re trying to be cheesy on purpose.\n\n&quot;Hit and Run&quot; could be a stepping stone to something bigger and better from Shepard, who might find more success if he took his brand to television or simply found a way to keep the energy up in future films so that the jokes will hit harder. In the meantime, &quot;Hit and Run&quot; avoids being total late-August junk, even if most will discover it down the road as a surprisingly decent rental.\n\n~Steven C\n\nThanks for reading!

The story is deceptively simple, told in an ingenious way, with a multidimensional understanding of each and every character. Every minute is crafted with purpose.\n\nAt one point near the ending, there&apos;s a moment of dialogue between two specific characters. I&apos;m not going to give any details to avoid spoilers. These characters said some simple lines, but these lines were so devastating and emotionally pure that I can hardly describe it. The screenwriter and director made it all look so simple, yet something like this can&apos;t easily be replicated or achieved.\n\nAnd the ending. I left the theatre thinking one thing, and then with more thought, it hit me like a train hours later.\n\nI don&apos;t know when this will come to theatres, but I&apos;ll be eagerly awaiting its release.",

I realize it&apos;s a lot to ask to have to cram the book into a two-hour film, a lot of story and character background had to be sacrificed. All of our main characters are there, some visibly altered to suit 21st century norms, but not well fleshed out. A bunch of liberties are taken with the storyline as well, some for no clear reason, it seems. I guess if you have never read the book, you wouldn&apos;t know what you&apos;re missing. But the most heinous thing about this film is simple: if you&apos;re the least bit of a horror movie fan, It&apos;s Not Scary. Like, at all.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Can you find the map behind either of the three bushes?&quot; is one of several things little Dora would ask her viewers on her show Dora the Explorer. I was in middle school when Dora the Explorer made it&apos;s debut on Nickelodeon. I was already too old for it, but it was a monster hit for the under seven demographic it was aiming for. From the few episodes I saw, it did it&apos;s job well buy keeping kids interacting with the show. But unlike Blues Clues that had very mundane and general mysteries, Dora the Explorer at least tried to add a little more education with zoology and a main character that was Latina. I merely saw it as harmless while Nickelodeon saw it as money.\n\nIn the age where reboots and remakes are all the rage, it makes sense Hollywood would want to tap into the nostalgia of Dora before it was too late. When a movie was announced, I kept wondering how that would be done as movies based off a little kid aimed material rarely sells. Just as the people who&apos;ve made movies off of Sesame Street and Thomas the Tank Engine. But Dora and the Lost City of Gold tries something different; it tries to be funny.\n\nYoung teenager Dora (played by Isabela Moner) may be grown up, but still loves exploring the South American jungle with her monkey Boots (played by Danny Trejo), singing songs to herself and keeping an upbeat sprit about her life. After a fall, her parents Cole (played by Michael Peña) and Elena (played by Eva Longoria) decide that she needs to be around kids her own age and send her to Los Angeles to go live with her cousin Diego (played by Jeff Wahlberg).\n\nWhen going to Diego&apos;s high school, she finds her jungle skills and knowledge out of place in a culture of cliques and teenage angst. Nevertheless, she continues to be herself while trying to get back her friendship she used to have with Diego. The both of them are on a fieldtrip when they and two other students get kidnapped by treasure hunters who hope Dora can lead them to her parents who are searching for a lost city of gold. Their sent back to South America, but get away thanks to a fellow explorer Alejandro (played by Eugenio Derbez). Even with an adult, it&apos;s up to Dora to lead her friends into the jungle the find her parents and perhaps a lost city of gold.\n\nI can&apos;t believe I&apos;m saying this, but I actually liked Dora and the Lost City of Gold. Not only was it genuinely funny, but it kept my interest in a story that seems like a safer version of Goonies. Is it as good as the latter? No, in fact there are moments that are too dumb, but for the most part, this is a movie that knows what it is and wants to be: a silly adventure. There&apos;s nothing wrong with being silly.\n\nThis is a movie that&apos;s made for fans of Dora the Explorer, but it&apos;s also for those that made fun of it. It&apos;s aware of how annoying the cartoon was for the adults who had to listen to it when their toddlers watched it. A lot of it works thanks to Isabela Moner, who remains as committed as hell to not only making her work as a likable character, but one who can be a literal live-action cartoon.\n\nWhile I had fun, I know that regular adult are not going to get into this at all if they don&apos;t have some nostalgia with the character. What does hurt it is while it tries to evolve Dora and her adventure, it still succumbs to cliché family movie parts like the annoying geek character and bathroom jokes. I understand it&apos;s a film that still has to appeal to children, but if movies like Inside Out and Up have shown anything, the story can still be great without having to go for lowbrow humor. A part of me also realizes that if I was around ten, I would have dug this movie and maybe even asked my parents to take me to it again.\n\nI&apos;ll give this seven Doras out of ten. Again, even though I liked it and had fun with it&apos;s meta jokes, this is not meant for adults unless they have some nostalgia or even at least some interest. It weird to think that the CGI Lion King remake was bad while a live action Dora the Explorer was better then expected. I suppose it&apos;s earned the right to sing &quot;We did it&quot;",

Bill Nighy is perfect in the lead role of the senior civil servant who is forced to confront his own mortality and Amy Lou Wood and Alex Sharp provide fine support at the other end of the age spectrum. There are some lovely scenes all played with understated panache and whilst the storyline is undoubtedly a little sad the film leaves the viewer appreciative of what&apos;s really important in life. It also achieves this in an understated, non preachy and gentle tone. There&apos;s also a fine soundtrack throughout and a lovely final scene to round it all off.",

He and him family movie into a huge mansion in a gated community in Beverly Hills. They are just settling in when the thing they most feared arrives. The Purge exists in the richest city in the country, and they are the only black family around. Things can only go bad. This is a strange movie. This is not really a spoof in the usual sense. This is really more of a remake of The Purge movie done as a comedy instead of a horror. Unlike the Scary Movie series it doesn&apos;t take from all other movies. There are some funny parts in this but it did seem to drag a little. The two biggest problems with this movie however were the over used cliché racist jokes. We get it, your black so even when crime is illegal you will get caught...very funny. The biggest problem with the movie though is that the actors didn&apos;t look like the wanted to be in this. That really hurt the comedy due to the fact that you almost felt sorry for them. Overall, Some people will enjoy this but as for me the movie was only funny in some parts, and only because I saw the original Purge. I give this a C.",

I expected that the second Butterfly effect movie would continue on this highly enjoyable path. I found it strange and puzzling that Butterfly effect 2 did not make it onto the big screen , but was send strait onto DVD instead?. After I saw the movie, I had to conclude that Butterfly effect 2 is not even a shadow of the original Butterfly effect movie. The story is a lame, predictable love story without suspense or thrill. Now I can understand why the second movie was demoted directly onto a DVD. The first Butterfly effect movie was a trilling , suspenseful wild water ride compared to this stagnant pool of muck....",

Having viewed a few of Miranda July&apos;s shorts on her website), I hoped this film would live up to the level set there. It does. July plays the lead character in what turns out to be an ensemble of people, each with his/her own quirks, who are somehow linked together (most simply by being neighbors). This movie is made up of what might be a string of perfect little short films. Each scene builds on the previous scene, adding one more enticing facet to a personality; one more little twist to a story. By the final scene, each character has as much depth and complexity as some of the real people we know. Indeed, one might wish that everyone was as interesting as the characters in this film."

      "reviewBody": "King of Kong (or Billy vs. Steve, basically), is an excellent film about a rivalry that says a lot about competition in our culture. The movie portrays Billy, the Donkey Kong Champion, doing everything in his power to keep his record and to deny Steve Wiebe (wee-Bee) the title of world record holder in Donkey Kong. Steve is an outsider in this culture where Billy is an icon, and at first there are people within the video game community who do not want him to succeed. It becomes kind of a struggle between good and evil, as the powers that be try to hold down those not in power. Suddenly, Steve is the guy you&apos;re rooting for, if only just to beat that smart-ass Billy. It is a journey that takes you through the darker and seedier side of the video game revolution of the &apos;80s. If it seems silly to be writing about such weighty issues of good and evil when a movie is about a video game, watch the movie: it really does the job of making you care about what happens to these odd, fascinating people.",

      "reviewBody": "Under Paris was certainly a film. Although I don&apos;t particularly know how to describe it, but this film did have some good things, and also some not so good things. The Film also did start out interestingly, and kind of develops the story along. The main focus in this scenario is Sophia. And they have never seemed to get the effects right for a shark, apart from the Meg. Not even Jaws. So, digest the shenanigans of Under Paris with me.\n\nSo, Sophia. Where does the film start? It is about her husband, and I presume they are both marine biologists, so apologies if I&apos;m wrong, but her husband died due to a shark attack. And now 3 years later, the Shark has come back, to seek revenge. The Shark appears and should put a hold on the race, but it doesn&apos;t. The mayor is quite happy to keep it going, kind of dumb. Especially when they are now going to be attacked by a Shark.\n\n&quot;Don&apos;t go in the Water&quot;, proceeds to go in the water. And it was that type of film throughout, hilariously dumb decisions that made absolutely no sense. Jade as a result gets eaten by the Shark, as she tries to tough the baby shark, which is stupid in itself. So then after that, she&apos;s chomped by the shark.\n\nThe scene I described about Jade getting eaten, has some intense scenes and a very deadly scenario leads to some people getting eaten by the Shark. The mother, but it doesn&apos;t end there, as the big swim is still on. I like this part of the film, it was very action-packed. And had edge of your seat action, that went faster and faster as the Shark moved along.\n\nWhat sets this film apart from other movies, It&apos;s dumb, yes. It&apos;s ridiculous, yes. It has, oh never mind it does A shallows and has explosions in the water, and collapses the bridge. Yes, that is all the same. However, the Shark is different, could be. And I love the commentary about the ecosystem and the pollution in the water, that&apos;s the difference. It also has interesting ideas about adaptation and weather the Shark can survive or not. But If it&apos;s near you, your body is twisting and tuning, and then we&apos;ll your eaten.\n\nThe End race commences, should it? Probably not. But hear we go!, and that&apos;s when everything gets exciting, intense. And people are being eaten by the Sharks. The explosions go off, the FBI fire at will, and it ends in chaos, it was certainly and action-packed 15 Minutes. Full of scenes that were ridiculous and non-sensical, and some entertainment through this part.\n\nAfter all of that chaos, we then end with a flooded Paris, so now it&apos;s On Top of Paris. With Sharks all around the perimeter, now the police are stuck. And the end shows a beutiful view of Paris, and a flying bird. That ends the film In style. Now I will end my review, right after the Verdict.\n\nWould I recommend this film? Honestly, you&apos;ll be entertained, and if your a fan of Shark movies then I would, but keep away if brain dead movies aren&apos;t for you. This film had everything though, Under Paris gets an average score of 5 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Let me start with saying that when the movie was finished and the lights were on again, I did not want it to end. I wanted to see what would happen even afterwards, I wanted it to continue. I was stunned to my seat with lot of thoughts and emotions.\n\nPlot: Two lifelong friends and mothers - Lil, who is a widower and Roz, who is married - whose bonds go back to their childhood, adore each other and their sons. Their sons are also best friends and during one summer evening after wine and fun Roz and Ian (Lil&apos;s son) are getting attracted to each other. Passion takes them into unknown and questionable territory - they have sex. Tom (Roz&apos;s son) sees his mother leaving Ian&apos;s room and Tom takes the news to Lil. It doesn&apos;t take long for Lil and Tom to fall into the same pattern.\n\nThere are hesitations, but these do not last long and the secret relationships continue until the plot takes you to 2 years later when Tom goes to Sydney. His visit to Sydney changes everything for four of them - the nasty truth has its way to come out and alter everybody&apos;s happy lives.\n\nI loved the story. It was dramatic, heartbreaking, beautiful and sad. I loved the relationships and how these were handled in the movie. It&apos;s a story where you have high doubts about happy endings. But the plot and the director kept surprising you and it asked a lot of important questions. What kind of love is acceptable? Does age matter? Can people handle the consequences of their own actions and do these make them happy? Is it allowed to fall passionately in love when you are middle-aged? Why are people willing to give up on love even though they do not want to do that, but know it&apos;s the only reasonable thing to do? Is it love when you do what you think is best and hurt the one you love with that? All these and many other questions were raised and it is up to the viewer to decide and find the answers to them. What I loved about Adore was exactly, that the answers were not given to you, it woke a lot of thoughts.\n\nAdore was filled with interesting relationships. My favorite was the relationship between Roz and Ian and it broke my heart to see what people do to the ones they love. Roz wanted to give Ian free because of her loyalty to Lil and because she wanted that Ian could enjoy his young life. The sad thing was, that Ian did not want that freedom, he ached for Roz for years, he loved her. Roz did what she felt was right and suffered because of that.\n\nWhen you look at the relationship between Lil and Tom, it was simpler, but not easier for that matter. There were more secrets and these secrets hurt the not only themselves, but also Ian and Roz.\n\nAdore is a movie about love and betrayal and relationships.\n\nDirecting, sets: I have seen few other movies directed by Anne Fontaine and Adore proved once again, than she is one of the best female contemporary directors. I personally think she did an excellent work with the movie.\n\nThe settings in the New South Wales in Australia were beautiful. There were lot of scenes on and nearby the sea and beach. It was absolutely breathtaking! Casting and the ensemble: Both Naomi Watts and Robin Wright belong to my long-time favorites and the delivered exactly and more what I expected from them. Bigger surprises were the young men playing Ian and Tom - Xavier Samuel and James Frecheville. I truly liked how they played their characters, they had quite a big tasks with these roles and they were believable and natural as Ian and Tom. Very suitable cast in my opinion.\n\nGenerally: Adore is a controversial movie. I think there are people who would love the imbroglio of relationships and friendships and then there are the ones who would judge them. I belong to the first group. I really enjoyed the drama!",

      "reviewBody": "In the same vein as Blair Witch and the Paranormal Franchise, The Devil Inside is another entry in the hand-held documentary style film. Although I think Blair Witch and PA did a much better job of making the &quot;found footage&quot; gimmick believable. Anyway The Devil Inside tells the story of a young girl, Isabelle who travels to Italy to learn more of the so-called demonic possession of her institutionalized mother.\n\nThe film opens with a 911 call made from the girl&apos;s mother in which she confesses to murdering three people who were trying to perform an exorcism. I guess it&apos;s safe to say it didn&apos;t work because when we next see the mother, she&apos;s holed up in Italian hospital for the criminally insane, mumbling to herself and looking generally frightening. Isabelle is looking to investigate the circumstances behind her mother&apos;s crimes and hopefully get her returned to the United States. And so the footage goes, mostly capturing her quest to learn more about exorcism, along with some help from two men she meets at a Roman Catholic university.\n\nIt could have been a very effective film if it wasn&apos;t for the glaringly flawed ending. Up to that point there was nice buildup and a few rather shocking moments. Then abruptly, it just ended. Poof! Like that. Shows over, go home. Myself along with the entire audience sat there for several moments after the ending scene, waiting....for something. I guess it took a few minutes to realize there would be nothing else. The ending came out of nowhere. None of the questions raised by the film were ever answered. The last 10 minutes embarked on a different path that just wasn&apos;t followed. It appeared as if the final climax was coming and then somehow the producers ran out of money so they just wrapped the film with whatever footage they had.\n\nAs it stands, the movie is incomplete so I can&apos;t give it more than a 5. Had there been an additional 20 minutes or more, I probably would have given it a 6.5 or 7.\n\nThis movie should have been titled The Devil Inside: Part 1.\n\nWhere the heck is the last half?!",

Regehr plays it absolutely straight for the young audience this film was aimed at.\n\nWith an original premise based on how Bud&amp;Lou got tangled up with all their monsters in Abbott&amp;Costello Meet Frankenstein and a climax which liberally borrowed from the Back To The Future films, The Monster Squad is still an enjoyable film for young audiences.",

The actors did a fantastic job of creating a seriously anxiety producing atmosphere that keeps you both engaged and entertained. If you enjoy seriously tense and creepy confrontational battles between a villain and his would-be victim who refuses to go down quietly then you cannot go wrong with adding this gem to your collection.",

I know this film was panned on release but I found myself enjoying it regardless, at least on a superficial level. It&apos;s not on par with something moving like GLORY but it does tick all of the right boxes and even though parts of the story are clichéd, I was still engaged in the tale.\n\nThe script is nothing to write home about, playing out all of the usual characters from the wild man fighter ace to the gruff but proud officer and the rookie. The cast is undistinguished with only Cuba Gooding Jr. and Terrence Howard standing out as the guys at the top. However, RED TAILS does offer plentiful action, and it&apos;s a lot better than I was expecting. Yes, Lucas is still obsessed with CGI, and absolutely everything in this film is a CGI effect (including a football!) but so much money has been spent in post production that the effects look remarkably good. This is a thrilling, old-fashioned adventure and one I had no qualms about enjoying. It&apos;s certainly better than the STAR WARS prequels...",

Christopher Plummer (Abraham Van Helsing) was wonderful as was Jonny Lee Miller (Simon). Gerard Butler was an interesting new Dracula. He played the mysterious and seductive vampire extremely well. I think the biggest disappointment was Justine Waddell (Mary). When watching her first scene in the film, I burst into laughter (and so did everyone around me). Omar Epps was great, as always, as were the other &quot;big names&quot; in this movie. The rest of the acting was okay, but could have been better. The plot had some major potential but, unfortunately, it failed to really go anywhere exciting. This Dracula story is worth a watch but even though Wes Craven is involved here, don&apos;t get your hopes up too high."

And indeed, Penn delivers a somewhat convincing performance as (Robert Smith-inspired?) Cheyenne (poor choice of pseudonym, if you ask me, but hey, there&apos;s also a band called &quot;The Pieces of Sh*t&quot;, so)...\n\nThe problem is: that annoying voice!, and... Well, everything else. This is a pretty boring film, overall. Frances wasn&apos;t convincing, nor was anybody else besides Sean.\n\nSure, there are funny parts, but they&apos;re not enough to prevent the yawns, or fight the desire of doing something else during most part of it.\n\nMy 5/10 is strictly because of Penn&apos;s genius, indeed one hell of an actor, but he deserved a better script and a better... Well, everything.\n\nHonorable mention to the David Byrne/Will Oldham teaming up to perform a satisfying soundtrack, especially the main track &quot;Lay &amp; Love&quot;, excellent in my opinion.",

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re into your eighties/nineties action movies, you should probably appreciate muscle-bound heroes thumping hordes of bad-guys into submission. Yes, the films are hardly &apos;high brow,&apos; but enjoyable if you&apos;re in the right mood. Jean Claude Van Damme has starred in plenty of cheesy &apos;so-bad-they&apos;re-good&apos; films such as &apos;Kickboxer, Bloodsport&apos; and &apos;Universal Solider.&apos; However, despite &apos;Double Team&apos; - sort of - fitting into that genre, it&apos;s one you could probably pass on, unless you really need your fix of the &apos;Muscles From Brussels.&apos;\n\nJCVD plays, er, some sort of special ops soldier who, er, ends up fighting bad guys. Do you really need a plot synopsis? He kicks, he punches and he shoots his way through the usual faceless henchmen, but - and here is about the film&apos;s only real stand-out selling point - he does it alongside NBA megastar Dennis Rodman.\n\nBy all accounts Rodman hasn&apos;t starred in too many films and, based on what I saw here, that&apos;s quite a shame. I know he&apos;s allegedly a bit of a diva in real life and nowadays has &apos;questionable&apos; friendships, but (in &apos;Double Team&apos; at least) he really is quite a larger-than-life character and steals every scene from the more &apos;straight-laced&apos; Van Damme. They play off each other really well and Rodman comes across as a taller, even more flamboyant Wesley Snipes from &apos;Demolition Man.&apos;\n\n&apos;Double Team&apos; is an okay film in terms of action and plot - there&apos;s nothing you haven&apos;t seen much before. If you&apos;re a Van Damme mega-fan then you could probably do worse than sitting through this - it&apos;s only an hour and a half and it&apos;s hardly &apos;hard going.&apos; Plus if you&apos;re at all curious as to see how Rodman fairs on screen then this will answer all your questions - it&apos;s just a shame he doesn&apos;t really - properly - come into it until the final third. The bad guy is Mickey Rourke, but don&apos;t expect too much from him as he&apos;s barely on screen and I didn&apos;t even know it was him until I saw his name in the end credits!\n\nIf you like action B-movies like &apos;Under Siege&apos; then &apos;Double Team&apos; does fall short of that, which is a shame, as with a bit better writing and polish overall then it could have been a hidden gem rather than a background noise.",

      "reviewBody": "I Lost My Body is a captivating watch thanks mainly to the incredibly textured animation, but unfortunately I felt a little let down by the narrative which just seemed to go nowhere with no obvious resolution. Told through present day and two different periods of flash back we follow the hand of Naoufel which is desperate to reconnect with its owner after an accident. Prior to his accident we are drip fed information that Naoufel has had a tumultuous upbringing losing his parents in a car accident, growing up with an unloving foster parent whilst working unsuccessfully as a pizza delivery man instead of his early ambition to be a pianist or astronaut. It resonates for sure (I wanted to be a pilot or illustrator growing up, neither fulfilled like Naoufel). But after a failed pizza delivery his focus is given clarity in the form of Gabrielle. All the narrative jumps back and forth to weave the narrative together but its in the final act when the timelines converge that unfortunately Director Jérémy Clapin gave me no satisfying closure. I don&apos;t mind ambiguity in a film but this just seemed to peeter out without resolution. Undeniably the animation is mesmerising. Every frame is wonderfully drawn with texture on every surface, unlike many animated films which solely rely on one layer of shading to give form to a 2D image. The movement of the hand is also superb giving it a personality of its own as it goes on an urban assault course, avoiding both human and animal peril in order to find it&apos;s host. The music by Dan Levy is also brilliant and almost hypnotic adding atmosphere to the proceedings. Although not a perfect film I Lost My Body is a beautifully crafted animated film that might be more rewarding on repeat viewings but initially is somewhat of a disappointment due to it&apos;s ending.",

      "reviewBody": "In eighteenth century Romania, Rayne (Kristanna Loken), a warrior woman, half-human, half-vampire , is the main attraction at a freak-show but she she gets to escape. Afther that, she meets a fortuneteller (Geraldine Chaplin) who tells his father raped and killed her mother. Then she sets out to revenge her mother&apos;s rape by her father, Kagan ( Ben Kingsley), King of Vampires. Three vampire hunters, Sebastian (Matthew Davis), Katarin (Michelle Rodriguez) and Vladimir(Michel Madsen), from the Brimstone Society persuade her to join their cause. Meanwhile, Rayne falls in love with Sebastian and prepares her vengeance.\n\nThis exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, graphic violence, and brief nudism with mild sex scene. It packs large amount of guts and gore , there&apos;s a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount, several vampires are staked bloodily in the chest, even more bitten with large dents. There&apos;s really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood . Most of vampires and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck. Magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department. Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score and colorful and dark cinematography ; furthermore spectacular production design .The motion picture is regularly directed by Uwe Boll . All four of the films he has realized that were based upon video games, House of the Dead (2003), Alone in the Dark (2005), BloodRayne (2005) and BloodRayne II: Deliverance (2007) were listed on the bottom of barrel by the reviewers. Most of the other films he&apos;s directed, including Heart of America (2002), and Blackwoods (2002) are not widely available in America, but have received similarly low ratings among those who have seen them. All technicians and some actors participate in the following : BloodRayne II with Natassia Malthe, Zack Ward and again Michel Pare, Uwe Boll&apos;s fetish&apos;s actor. Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampire films or those enjoy in general.Rating : average though some moments is entertaining.",

Woody doesn&apos;t act in this, but his narration is excellent.\n\nHe takes the wonderful old songs and commercials from that time and weaves them into the story. I was completely captivated.\n\nIt&apos;s not a &quot;laugh a minute&quot; type film, but it also gets you thinking. Nevertheless, it has some hilarious scenes. Check out the Jewish fasting holiday scene. I&apos;ve watched it at least 6 times and I still laugh. Also the scene with Mia Farrow&apos;s character was superb. One of my favorite lines is when she tells a top radio producer in her high-pitched nasal voice, &quot;Jeez. We can&apos;t keep meeting like this. In the backs of cars, movie theaters and stalled elevators. You&apos;re gonna lose your respect for me!&quot; I love this film.",

It can happen, until you sit down to watch this one.\n\nIt&apos;s not going to be confused with any arthouse, fancy cinema fare, either.\n\nThere is an audience for this and they will be completely entertained and walk out of this experience totally satisfied.\n\nI&apos;m just not a part of that audience.\n\nIt&apos;s a decent flick.\n\nJust based on the inspired casting and the look of the whole movie alone, it has to be a six.\n\nBut I have to stop there.\n\nIf you&apos;re well versed in action films that predate, I&apos;d say, 2010, then you&apos;ve seen this movie before and with better execution and certainly a better, more detailed storyline.\n\nThe fight sequences are solid but the rest of it is not.\n\nThe protagonist is a deaf mute who&apos;s hellbent on revenge.\n\nOnly we hear his inner thoughts.\n\nA lot.\n\nHe talks so much in voiceover that it gets old super quick and it never stops.\n\nThe whole movie.\n\nA quip here.\n\nA deep thought there.\n\nThoughts on this. Thoughts on that.\n\nHe may be kicking major butts but he&apos;s a regular chatty Cathy on the inside.\n\nGood grief.\n\nThere&apos;s still things to love about this movie.\n\nFamke Janssen (Rounders), Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey) two of my all time crushes.\n\nLove them still and love them both here. Lots.\n\nYayan Ruhian (The stellar Raid films) and Brett Gelman (The Other Guys, Stranger Things) Love those dudes!\n\nAnd I totally get Bill Skarsgard trying TJ distance himself from It, and rip himself up for this role.\n\nBut as good as this movie looks, and everybody in here is good in their parts.\n\nIt&apos;s just not a great movie.\n\nIt could be great with better writing and less voiceover.\n\nThere are far superior movies out there about vengeance.\n\nBoy not only Kills World, he kills this movie.\n\nOddly enough, as I consumed this film, it reminded me of a few female driven action movies of the last thirty years or so: Tank Girl, Aeon Flux, and Ultraviolet.\n\nI won&apos;t even bother to explain it but it just does.\n\nThere is an end scene of some substance that&apos;s worth sticking around for.",

Not quite as full of himself, in other words, but still pretty full. What made his first few films so terrific was his incorporation of real Aikido; eventually, he started doing something with only minimal relation to that art. Not to mention getting fat and pompous.\n\nI&apos;ve never been terribly bothered by the fact that the man can&apos;t act, because he was fun to watch. For years, though, he hasn&apos;t been fun and he still can&apos;t act. There&apos;s more action here, and less Steven Seagal standing around looking full of himself -- that&apos;s a big improvement right there.\n\nI notice a lot of &quot;who needs a plot, it&apos;s an action film!&quot; comments on this and other movies. Action is great but a little effort on plot makes for a more interesting movie. Throwing in innumerable scenes set in topless joints (what is *that* all about?) doesn&apos;t make up for a storyline."

      "reviewBody": "The time is the early eighties. Two detectives, a good-cop (Pedro) bad-cop (Juan) pairing, are sent to a remote region in Spain to investigate the disappearance of teenage sisters. They uncover a series of brutal murders that the tight-knit community may be complicit in. Set in a Spain slowly emerging from Franco&apos;s shadow, Marshland has a wonderfully political noir-ish tone. Opening with birds-eye shots of an other-worldy landscape, that the camera often returns to, the futility and inhumanity of the toils that take place on the ground is constantly invoked by the judicious shot choice. Pedro and Juan have personal concerns beyond the investigation. Pedro&apos;s wife is pregnant and not always trusting of him in their separation. Juan has failing health and may not be long for this world. They bring their past as well as their present: Juan was in Franco&apos;s Gestapo and may have carried out atrocities, Pedro is being punished for open criticism of the military. They deal with these issues as best they can while navigating local resistance to their investigation and their own wary sense of each other. The characters, setting, tone and pace are all compelling, and the overhead shots add wonder and mystery. There are hints of Mississippi Burning here, and also True Detective and Chinatown - a local oligarch seems amoral and ultimately goes unpunished. But the film wears these influences lightly and portrays its own authentic, self-contained world. This is a stylish thriller that comfortably meshes plot, politics and personal concerns.",
