      "reviewBody": "I have read many reviews that seemed to think Gothika was a waste of time. Let me just say, it is not a waste of time. in fact, the film was very enjoyable. it was shot well and the special effects were sophisticated and well handled. The cast was full of surprises such as Bernard Hill(great actor but a strange role). The story was interesting and there was genuine tension throughout.\n\nBerry&apos;s character is a doctor in a mental institute. she wakes up to find herself an inmate in the very place she works. Her colleague and friend played by robert downy jnr tells her that she has committed a horrific crime and nobody knows why. so the plot begins to wind its way towards a shadowy truth. However, without giving anything away, the key scenes where important truths are revealed to the audience are simply too clumsy. information is just handed over visually on a plate and leaves little to the imagination. some of the tension built up in\n\nthe first half of the film is lost. and the truth isn&apos;t quite as gripping and terrifying as we would have hoped(although thats not to\n\nsay it is pleasant).\n\nRobert Zemeckis was one of the producers and i think it shows..there is some great camera work and some really interesting ideas but gothika doesn&apos;t have some of the subtle touches that What Lies Beneath had, but its easy to see some of the parallels between the two films.\n\nEven though halle berry wears the same look of shocked disbelief throughout the film, she plays it with conviction. and a supporting role from penelope cruz certainly doesn&apos;t take anything away from berry.\n\nall in all, gothika provides a good story, an average screen play and enough innovative ideas to keep its audience. but i would have been disappointed if i had paid to watch it at the cinema."

They help each other navigate the dangerous underworld.\n\n&quot;Safe&quot; is a very good old school action film. The characters really fight hard, and they keep fighting throughout the film. There is no fancy effects or crazy explosions, they fight only using their fists and guns. It&apos;s been a while since I watched a no frills action film. The number of deaths is disturbing but it doesn&apos;t feel ridiculous like some films where the lead hero is invincible. The girl who plays the whiz kid is really good in her role, she&apos;s very believable. I enjoyed the film. The title is very clever too!"

Another is the eye candy. No, I&apos;m not talking about Robert Pattinson(though he looks as gorgeous as ever). I&apos;m talking about the breathtaking cinematography, courtesy of Rodrigo Prieto.\n\nWhile the leads(Robert Pattinson, Reese Witherspoon, Christoph Waltz) all turn in GREAT performances, the real star here is Tai the elephant. She plays Rosie, the newest addition to The Benzini Bros. Most Spectacular Show on Earth, who is brought in in hopes of taking The Benzini Bros. circus to a new level(particularly to the level of Ringling Bros.).\n\nAs per usual, there are quite a few changes that may or may not irritate the readers. It all depends on the person. One that I felt was an improvement upon the book, however, was the combining of August and Uncle Al. I honestly didn&apos;t miss Al one bit.\n\nWater for Elephants is a beautiful, enchanting, mesmerizing must-see.",

I might be the only person in the world to think so but to me this sequel actually surpasses the original film and I think by a rather large margin. Everything that was good in the original is pretty much carried over to this film where it&apos;s done even better. I think the big benefit here over the original is that this sequel doesn&apos;t run too long and instead it has a much better pacing to it. However, what really makes the film tick are some incredibly action sequences, which includes a hilarious one at Niagra Falls where Lois plans to test Clark to try and see whether he&apos;s really Superman or not. The way this entire scene plays out is incredibly funny but also contains some great action. Humor is something that is also much better this time around and especially during the scene where the three aliens wreck havoc on a small redneck town. This here is a pretty long sequence but the laughs really don&apos;t stop at any point. I think another major plus with this sequel is that we&apos;re given not only a great villain in Luthor (Gene Hackman) but the aliens are also a lot of fun. The three of them make for a great group to root against but at the same time you really love to hate them. As with the previous film, the performance are all extremely good with Reeve once again leading the way in his dual role as both the superhero and the nerd with glasses. I think it&apos;s safe to say that the actor really just had something special in him that allowed him to perfectly fit into both roles. Both Kidder and Hackman are good in their parts as is Jackie Cooper, E.G. Marshall and Ned Beatty in his one but funny scene. The action scenes are all extremely good and the special effects this time out are even better. SUPERMAN II is a rare case where the sequel is actually better than the original."

But your mileage may vary, and I&apos;ll let the other reviews cover that. My purpose here is to reveal the horror which I just witnessed on a basic cable showing of Fast Times.\n\nThis movie earned an initial &apos;X&apos; rating from the MPAA when first submitted, and after a few cuts garnered an &apos;R&apos; for its release. The movie I saw on basic cable this morning would barely rate PG. Massive cuts and edits were evident all through the film. Entire scenes were removed. The dialog was edited so that you&apos;d think it was made in the 1950&apos;s. The hilarious masturbation scene was edited in such a way that it appeared Linda walked in on Brad while he was peeing. (They actually ran the film backwards during this scene.) Even some of the musical soundtrack had changed, due to rights issues I&apos;d guess.\n\nMy point is, if you&apos;ve only seen this movie on basic cable, you really haven&apos;t seen this movie. The version I saw today was on A&amp;E, and they just butchered it. Things like that should be illegal.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m resigned to the fact that &quot;0 out of 124 people&quot; will find the following review useful (in the world of IMDb, dissenting opinions are usually regarded as useless - quite odd, as I always enjoy reading reviews that challenge my thoughts on a film). Anyway, here goes: If the original Cloudy was like one of those Heston Blumenthal dishes that&apos;s both outrageously odd and utterly brilliant - I don&apos;t know, perhaps fried egg with jam and Rice Krispies - then this misguided, saccharine sequel is a pointless pudding, an overly sweet dessert that makes you sick up a bit of the main course.\n\nFlint Lockwood (Bill Hader) lands a job with a shady corporation run by his childhood hero - funny how he wasn&apos;t mentioned in the first film - who decides to send Flint back to his home island for the post-first-film clean-up, whilst playing him off against his friends. The island itself is now inhabited by living beings made of food, including a cute little strawberry with the voice of Eric Cartman, a spider comprising Big Mac and fries, and a taco-dile that spits vegetables everywhere. Are you sure this script is ready? The problem, no doubt, is that Phil Lord and Chris Miller were only on hand to provide the story and exec-produce, with former South Park staffer Erica Rivinoja botching the writing job, and Cody Cameron (Shrek, Madagascar) and Cloudy contributor Kris Pearn taking care of the rest.\n\nThere are a few good jokes - the fishing trip, the translation, Steve the monkey generally - but it&apos;s largely overbearing sentiment, food creatures with punny names (essentially a Twitter hashtag that got out of hand), and Steve Jobs-based villainy, a sort of Robots/Wreck-It Ralph/Jurassic Park III hybrid, with a minimum of heart, wit and invention. I wanted something as anarchic and genuinely original as the first movie. Instead, I got a film that&apos;s not only aimed at kids, but doggedly conventional, and insultingly predictable, both in its re-treading of old ground and its telegraphing of old jokes.\n\nIt&apos;s the most disappointing movie I&apos;ve seen for a couple of years at least."

He acts as if he&apos;s guarding the White House, stopping people in motorized carts for infractions, reporting in even though his boss asks who it is, and going a little overboard in his handling of a new trainee.\n\nHe hasn&apos;t dated since his green card marriage blew up, but he sees a young woman at one of the kiosks, Amy (Jayma Mays) and falls head over heels. After he makes a complete fool of himself at a bar, she seems less friendly.\n\nWhen a gang announces the mall is closing early and starts an organized takeover and captures hostages, including Amy, Paul is fooling around with a guitar and singing in one of the stores. Therefore when the mall is locked, he&apos;s stuck in the mall. And it falls to him to do something about the robbery and the danger to the hostages.\n\nNormally the last thing I watch is films like this. These past two weeks I&apos;ve seen two. It&apos;s since the election. I have needed films to numb my mind. Kevin James makes me laugh with his slapstick and cluelessness, so it was fine.\n\nIt&apos;s predictable, it&apos;s funny in spots, it seems to go on longer than necessary, but by far it is not the worst thing I&apos;ve ever seen. And for a change with today&apos;s comedy, it didn&apos;t have vulgar jokes.\n\nThis last week I watched Netflix&apos;s True Memoirs of an International Assassin, also with Kevin James, to give you an idea of what all the divisiveness and hate of this election has done to me.",

      "reviewBody": "When you see a war veteran campaigning against the very war in which he was willing to die once, you begin to have second thoughts about the intent behind the war. Many Americans went deep into this deliberation when veterans like Ron Kovic went on record questioning the wisdom behind US&apos;s offensive against Vietnam. Regardless of historical outcome of the war, the question will haunt USA forever -was the Vietnam War a noble and just cause. Your answer could be anything depending upon your political and ideological preferences, but the reality of thousands who lost their lives and limbs continues to hurt.\n\nOliver Stone&apos;s Born on Fourth of July - based on the true story of Ron Kovic - takes the audience through the triumph and trauma of a crusader who went from one side of the war debate to the other. Ron wanted to fight for his country and stop the evil force of communism dead in its tracks. He went to Vietnam to defend his nation but came back soon, injured and doomed to suffer further. In the inadequately equipped hospital, his dreamer instincts crashed against the harsh realities of political ambivalence, not for the first time though.\n\nOver next eight years that are depicted in this masterpiece, the character of Ron Kovic (played by Tom Cruise with unprecedented brilliance) goes through the trauma of knowing that no one will &quot;love him now&quot;, that even his own sibling is not on the same side of ideology, that the government had more pressing issues than taking good care of war veterans, that his countrymen did not necessarily endorse of his view point. The reality that he killed a soldier from his own army, the reality that he was the unfortunate one to butcher children and women in Vietnam, the reality that he would not be able to father a child, the reality of his realization that his government had made a wrong case for the war - it all kept gnawing at his conscience. It kept gnawing him until he opened up to speak about what was wrong about this war. Thus &apos;ended&apos; the patriotic fervor of a driven person, but he continued his passion as an antiwar activist.\n\nBorn on Fourth of July may have been the story of one Ron Kovic, but there are many others whose sentiments would echo with this veteran&apos;s. At the end, there is no easy way out of this debate. War always comes with its baggage of pain, trauma and hurt. Whether Vietnam was a mistake or not - the arguments would go on forever. So would the history of people who aspired to be motivated by JFK&apos;s historical urge - Ask not what your country can do for you, See what you can do for your country - only to realize that in every war there is only one casualty - the human spirit. And this reality hurts.",

Why is Lee Daniels&apos; name above the title and who gave him this much license to re-write history after only one other film we&apos;ve heard of? \n\nThat said, Forest Whitaker is compelling as the lead in this story about a White House butler that had an amazing life, but it is 90% made up. While there was a butler who served many presidents, the screenplay is actually fiction. While somewhat entertaining, these comical characterizations of U.S. presidents often feel like a made for TV, kids history channel special. \n\nOprah plays his wife and there are a dozen or so entertaining cameos with some unique acting choices. The cameos kept it interesting even when the story of The Butler dragged on. \n\nIf Lee Daniels had let go of the politics and heavy-handed directing, this pseudo-history lesson may have earned an Oscar nomination for Forest. But, in the end, you can see why the Academy cannot reward this artificial and revisionist history tale. With this much effort to tell us a 60 year history lesson, I just wish we knew if more of it were true. Instead, it&apos;s a mixed bag. 7/10."

      "reviewBody": "I again want to give this the full five, but not sure. I don&apos;t get why more people don&apos;t like this. It&apos;s so underrated, and yet it&apos;s everything people love about Arnold and his movies. Loud, big, violent action, cheesy one-liners, a good villain, and this time it even has entertainingly bad CGI an Vanessa Williams, which are two things I&apos;m always down with watching. Mm\n\nArnold takes himself more seriously here it seems, at least until the second act. He delivers a great, movie-carrying performance as usual, and is compliment by the weirdly good Vanessa Williams, who ends up not being annoying. James Caan is a great villain, and definitely helps elevate it.\n\nThe action is exactly as you&apos;d expect. With a plot involving big, hi-tech &quot;chainguns&quot;, you know this is gonna be good. The opening house scene, the cabin scene, the plane scene, the zoo shootout, and the lab shootout are all cool, along with other scenes. The plane scene defies any logic or realism, and is lots of fun. The CGI is bad, but whatever. There&apos;s also a scene with a bad CGI crocodile that rips a dude&apos;s arm off, and attacks Arnold, who makes up for the effects by kicking it in the face and shooting it. The final battle though, is just perfect. It&apos;s total balls-out action, with Arnold becoming a one-man army as usual, and shooting tons of people with two chainguns before fighting James Caan on top of a giant metal container.\n\nI really love this and recommend it. It needs more attention and is as good as most of Arnold&apos;s other films.",

While a bit more plot and less polish than Ultraviolet, Doom entertains but fails to reach the balance of action/plot as found in Resident Evil. Where it does succeed is when it tries to entertain and reference the game (many here) in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, rather than try and elevate the plot to a social commentary.\n\nSarge (The Rock) is the leader of a Marines unit which is sent to research facility on Mars to investigate missing scientists. They soon realize that the research facility is doing more than an archaeological dig, and that the scientists aren&apos;t missing - they&apos;re transformed.\n\nThe Rock does a fine job of an alpha-male, cocky Marine with swagger. The supporting cast comes off as a &quot;wish we could&apos;ve gotten Actor A but instead got B&quot;. The sfx are good, especially the much anticipated FPS style. Unfortunately, this only lasts a few minutes of the film.\n\nWhether they make a sequel or not, Doom does entertain, and it leaves the ending open for more fun and doom."

We can only suspect what she feels and we can enjoy the sight of her sad gorgeous face.\n\nAnd absolutely no words are necessary!\n\nThis film compliments the saying: BE BORN HAPPY RATHER THAN BEAUTIFUL\n\nI do agree that Monica Belucci, who I consider to be the most beautiful actress alive and one of the most enchanting beauties in the world, was perfect for this part!"

But the film is criticized for its altered, less impactful ending as compared to the original. This change dilutes the original's unsettling atmosphere, making the remake more polished but less daring. While some appreciate its audience-friendly approach, others miss the original's raw psychological edge. Themes of social awkwardness and cultural differences are less pronounced.

      "name": "A remake that creates tension, without the original&apos;s charm",
      "reviewBody": "Speak No Evil is a 2024 psychological horror remake starring James Mcavoy as Paddy, a English father who invites a American family to come to their house and relax, however not everything is all it seems from the new Blumhouse feature.\n\nWhile getting most of the aspects on point from the 2022 foreign film of the same name, Speak No Evil does create a good level of tension while exploding into a violent climax which is a good aspect regarding the film&apos;s strong point as a psychological horror flick. The American family are very likable and very realistic when it comes to some of the more tense scenes of threat, you do really sympathise with them in general and throughout most of the runtime you do also get to see some of what there views are on the other English family. At first they think it&apos;s a new way of bonding with their new home but as the film progresses there perspectives slowly change and it makes you think if they will ever recover from the horrific things they have witnessed so far which does add a level of clarity and dread to the film&apos;s dark tone and that&apos;s very good.\n\nActing-wise, very top notch for a Blumhouse feature nowadays as James Mcavoy really is quite terrifying but funny at the same time. He is very identical. He reminds me of Jack Torrance from The Shining, very maniacal and twisted figure that has his comedic elements scattered throughout, I thought this was quite a interesting thing that I might notice but I think Paddy was a little bit different though just because of his charming aspect rather than a downward spiral of Jack&apos;s character&apos;s.\n\nOverall, while quite a solid entry into the Blumhouse library, the fatal flaw of this thriller is the lack of homage to the original film which really should be respected, but it seems like this entry does completely avoid some aspects which a remake shouldn&apos;t do unless it has a good reason to. But it&apos;s still a worthy, fun watch for a evening night.\n\nGrade: A Next film: Big shark.",

    "summary": "Reviewers say 'Five Nights at Freddy's' elicits mixed reactions, highlighting nostalgia and fan service. Practical effects and animatronic designs are lauded for their faithfulness to the game. However, the plot is criticized for being confusing and disjointed, failing to deliver expected horror and jump scares. Characters are seen as underdeveloped with poor dialogue, and inconsistent performances. Pacing issues cause the film to drag, yet some appreciate the atmosphere and set design, making it enjoyable for fans despite its flaws.",

They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!\n\nUnfortunately, that&apos;s where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it&apos;s PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can&apos;t decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It&apos;s annoying, because when it&apos;s not being FNAF, it&apos;s just boring. (Also maybe it&apos;s the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn&apos;t work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He&apos;s in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy&apos;s Wonderland, it&apos;s much better.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s hard to imagine someone seeing &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; without being moved somehow, yet few films suffer more in terms of reputation from winning a Best Picture Oscar. In disparaging &quot;Daisy,&quot; many myths have sprung up that cloud the film&apos;s legacy and need addressing.\n\n1. &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; won because 1989 was a weak year for movies - 1989 was a great year for movies. Among the films out that year which weren&apos;t even nominated for Best Picture were &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Henry V,&quot; &quot;Do The Right Thing,&quot; &quot;Parenthood,&quot; &quot;Batman,&quot; &quot;Crimes And Misdemeanors,&quot; &quot;The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen,&quot; &quot;sex, lies, and videotape,&quot; &quot;Steel Magnolias,&quot; and &quot;When Harry Met Sally.&quot; Unlike most years, any of the five Best Picture nominees could have won without anyone being too upset.\n\n2. &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; is a syrupy feel-good exercise devoid of grit - While made in an artfully soft-focus and gentle style in keeping with the spirit we associate with the American South of recent bygone days, director Bruce Beresford and writer Alfred Uhry present us with a complicated and tricky story that challenges us right away. How many films get made showing old Jewish women complaining a poor black man stole a 33 cent can of salmon from her pantry? &quot;Daisy&quot; allows its central character to say some astounding things about blacks (&quot;They all take things, you know,&quot; &quot;They&apos;re like children,&quot;) and yet trusting us to have the tolerance to watch her grow.\n\n3. &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; was popular because it features a passive black man - Morgan Freeman as Hoke gives a haunting, multi-layered performance of someone who is anything but passive. Because he is a black man in the Jim Crow South, he must make do working as a driver for Miss Daisy despite her resentment of him (which stems from her anger over her infirmity, not his skin color, to address another myth.) Hoke is a model of stoic patience, of finding silver linings and angles, and breaking down barriers through common sense. &quot;You needs a chauffeur and Lord knows I needs a job,&quot; is how he puts it to Miss Daisy. &quot;Now why don&apos;t we leave it at that?&quot; Of course, his patience with Miss Daisy over time yields more than a mere truce, not to mention a healthy raise and some fine used automobiles. And he retains his dignity in every scene.\n\n4. &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; is mainly about race - Race is a theme, but the central theme is the passage of time. The film presents us with small vignettes, connected to seasons of the year, charting the growing relationship between Hoke and Daisy. As the characters age, we see every wrinkle on their skin and sense without anything being pointed out too strongly just how fragile and fleeting this thing called life really is. By film&apos;s end, long after race has been addressed, we are giving witness to the elusive pleasures of life in the face of Miss Daisy&apos;s mortality, a tough message for any movie to go out on, especially one as ultimately life-affirming as this.\n\n5. Jessica Tandy won her Oscar out of sympathy because of her age - She won it because she was good. Very good. Check out her scene when she tells Hoke about visiting the Gulf of Mexico and tasting the saltwater on her fingers, then snapping at herself for being so silly. Then you get winning zingers, delivered with impeccable vinegar, like this about her assimilated daughter-in-law: &quot;If I had a nose like Florine, I wouldn&apos;t say Merry Christmas to anybody.&quot; Ouch! I actually am less won over by that famous line of hers, &quot;You&apos;re my best friend,&quot; because she makes the point so well with Hoke throughout the latter half of the film in many better ways.\n\n6. It&apos;s boring - &quot;Daisy&quot; runs only a little over 90 minutes, and makes the most of every one of them. Nothing runs too long. When a member of the household dies, you get a falling bowl and then a singing choir. When Daisy teaches Hoke to read, it&apos;s represented by a small sequence in a graveyard and then let go. It would seem abrupt on the pages of the script, yet Mark Warner&apos;s crafty editing and Hans Zimmer&apos;s deft score make it all seem so natural.\n\n7. Films like &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; get made all the time - The only film that mixes comedy and pathos as effectively as this that I&apos;m aware of is &quot;Being There.&quot; But while that classic Peter Sellers film is something of a fantasy, &quot;Daisy&quot; is so grounded in reality it makes its ultimately uplifting character that much more satisfying.",

      "reviewBody": "Interesting concept but once the story plays out it isn&apos;t really all that much. But it is an entertaining bit.\n\nThe premise is that in the near future we spot an asteroid heading towards Earth, big enough that if it hits us then it will be the end of humanity as we know it. So a mission has been sent to ostensibly destroy it or divert it, to save the Earth.\n\nSteve Carell is Dodge and he and his wife are sitting in their car, listening to a news report that sadly the mission has failed, there was a fire, the spaceship was destroyed, all were lost. In 21 days the asteroid will hit, there is nothing that can be done.\n\nSo with that as a set-up the movie examines how people react to that news, knowing they have exactly 3 weeks to live then it will be all over. Naturally it touches on some of the fringe behavior, guys who want to use their remaining time to have as much sex as possible, or party with alcohol and drugs, or just go through the streets looking and wreaking havoc. At a minimum, most quit going to work, gasoline runs short, commercial airlines quit flying.\n\nI had difficulty discerning if this was intended as a dark comedy. For example, a TV news man would report, but end the session by saying they would continue to play their music programming. As if that mattered to anyone.\n\nBut Dodge is different. As soon as the bad news came, his wife got out of the car and fled. He realized quickly she had no love for him. As he tried to make sense of everything, he met a younger woman, Keira Knightley as Penny , an unstable sort from England, but wanted to get back and see her parents one more time. Dodge decided to help her. And that become &quot;the rest of the movie.&quot; When it was over it was pleasant enough entertainment, maybe I though a bit about what I would do in a similar predicament, but ultimately it was a love story with a quite different catalyst.\n\nSPOILERS: Dodge decided he would see if he could get to his estranged dad, a pilot, to fly Penny home. In the process his dad was able to say &quot;I&apos;m sorry&quot; for everything that happened over the years. And, in a &quot;Casablanca moment&quot; Dodge put a sleeping Penny on the small plane, and right before he closed the door whispered to her &quot;the love of my life.&quot; But a little later, when Dodge is back home, Penny shows up. She had asked that they return, she would rather be with Dodge at the end. As they lay in bed, we hear big rumblings, then everything goes dark."

      "name": "Odd, bleak, but ultimately transfixing musical drama, pop singer Björk immerses herself completely in this tailor-made role.",
      "reviewBody": "The reviews were extremely black and white for this art-house film.  People were either enthralled or bored to tears by the whole experience.  There seemed to be no middle ground.  Now, that&apos;s my kind of movie.  Any picture that can reap awards (Cannes Film Festival) and get lambasted by the general public at the same time will always pique my interest.  In respect, it was a rich, rewarding odyssey, much easier to get through than, let&apos;s say, even half of &quot;8½.&quot;  \n\nMy initial respect for the unique, uncompromising style of Danish director Lars von Trier goes back to his compelling work in &quot;Zentropa&quot; and &quot;Breaking the Waves,&quot; both bleak, surrealistic studies of man vs. reality.  His pieces usually center around some innocent, simple-minded, self-sacrificing soul who inevitably succumbs to the cruelties of life.\n\nI found the central role of Selma (as played by the extraordinary Björk) to be very much the emotional equivalent of Emily Watson&apos;s touchingly childlike, near-sociopath Bess in &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; -- blessed and cursed with a naive, soulful purity.  Selma represents one of God&apos;s little quirks of nature.  A bespectacled, pathetically infantile little ragamuffin completely out of touch, Selma has somehow survived like the runt of a litter would - through luck, will power, and the extreme kindness of those around her.  An impoverished Czech-born emigré living in a small Northwestern U.S. industrial town during the mid-60s, this luckless creature manages to eek out a meager Airstream-like existence as a factory worker, despite the fact she is legally blind.\n\nSelma is, amazingly enough, a mother.  Seemingly ill-equipped to care for a child much less herself, she has nevertheless managed to provide for the 12-year-old boy, while nurturing the child as a young girl would her rag doll.  The fairly adjusted boy suffers, however, from the same optic disease as the mother, while the crux of the story revolves around her attempts to save up money for his inevitable operation.    \n\nThe fascination of &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; lies in Selma&apos;s musical world.  With her eyesight failing, her ears become the only sense of joy, falling periodically into bouts of fantasy anytime she grabs onto a rhythm or beat (like machine sounds, train engines, etc.), wherein she becomes the star of her own working-class musical production.  These compelling sequences become mere extensions of her real-life circumstances, i.e., the musical interludes at work will include the factory itself as a set piece and the other workers as her ensemble.  A strange mix of Fellini neo-realism and Busby Berkeley illusion, these daydreams (sparked by Vincent Paterson&apos;s inventive choreography and von Trier&apos;s purposely puerile lyrics) become her only escape.  Björk&apos;s odd musical talent and vocal style may be an acquired taste, but she is so mesmerizing here it becomes a non-issue.  In addition, there are brief moments of levity as a hopelessly inept community theater production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; goes into rehearsals with the very awkward Selma playing Maria.\n\nThe subordinate cast is equally in tune.  The wonderful, beguiling French star Catherine Deneuve downplays her ethereal beauty as Kathy, Selma&apos;s co-worker and trusted friend.  And a strange, maternalistic friendship it is indeed, for this woman seems to have no other purpose in life than to be this girl&apos;s eyes and hands, looking out for her practically day and night. Peter (&quot;Fargo&quot;) Stormare shies away from his ruthless killer image with this touching portrayal of a sensitive, almost pitiable boor who only has eyes for the ungainly Selma.  David Morse is gripping as a seemingly compassionate but despairing policeman whose one desperate act involving neighbor Selma results in tragedy.  Joel Grey has a brief, telling moment near the film&apos;s end as a faded musical star idolized by Selma.\n\nAs in his other featured works, von Trier&apos;s gritty, hand-held camera work may be dizzying to the point of distraction at first but its overall impact to the stark proceedings is unquestionable.  Moreover, the grueling paces he puts his actresses through to achieve absolute truth borders on misogyny but the rewards are tenfold.  As in the case of Emily Watson, Björk has never shined brighter as an artist.\n\nA harrowing, refreshingly original piece of filmmaking that should be experienced by anybody who dares to be different.",

In terms of plot, its simpler than simple - American reporter Linda Kozlowski is sent to Australia to investigate the legendary &apos;Crocodile&apos; Dundee (Hogan) and ends up bringing the charming rogue back to the Big Apple.  It&apos;s a winner in every sense from Hogan&apos;s wonderfully laid-back performance to his own screenplay, featuring an array of classic quips and moments.  Peter Best&apos;s excellent musical score also deserves applause in helping to ensure that this film remains great, exciting and still novel entertainment almost two decades on."

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. True stories are often at the heart of many movies each year. However, there are true stories and then there is the story of the Paiva family. Marcelo Rubens Paiva has written two books, which along with numerous interviews with family and friends, serve as the basis for this film from famed Brazilian director Walter Salles (THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES.2004). The screenplay comes from co-writers Murilo Hauser and Heitor Lorega.\n\nUnless you are a history scholar, it&apos;s highly unlikely you can recite the various Latin America dictatorships and military coups over the past decades. Yet you surely know they have happened, and that many innocent people and families have been victimized. The Paiva family is one example, and their story is gut-wrenching. The film begins in Rio de Janeiro in 1970 when military rule was in place. Director Salles affords us plenty of time to get to know architect Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), his wife Eunice (Fernanda Torres), and their five kids. Theirs is a happy family living a pleasant and comfortable life ... gatherings on the beach, music and dancing, family meals and photos. In one moment, the happiness fades and things change forever.\n\nA group of men show up to escort Rubens (a long-ago local Congressman) in for a deposition. He smiles and tells the family that he will be back soon. The saga of this family is torturous to watch. Eunice and her oldest daughter are soon taken in and held for questioning in what appears to be some type of prison or military facility. They learn Rubens is accused of being a communist. Eunice&apos;s return home is a beautifully filmed sequence, as it&apos;s nighttime and the kids are sleeping.\n\nThe next morning&apos;s reunion is touching, yet now the reality has hit for the older daughters. Eunice kicks into strong woman mode to protect her &quot;babies&quot;. The story shifts significantly here since the wage earner is gone. Eunice sells the house and the family moves to Sao Paulo. Eunice handles the extreme stress, continues caring for her kids, and never stops trying to find out about Rubens.\n\nThe journey of Eunice could easily fill a movie, however, Salles chooses to jump ahead 25 years (to 1996) and then again to 2014, when the family is together and wheelchair bound and Alzheimer&apos;s stricken Eunice is played by 95-year-old Fernanda Montenegro (Oscar nominated for CENTRAL STATION, 1998), the real-life mother of Fernanda Torres. During these segments, we figure out what an impressive woman Eunice is and how much she has accomplished through determination. It&apos;s likely a death certificate has never been more valued or more pursued than the one Eunice finally receives. We also see her son Marcelo is now physically disabled, yet becoming famous as a writer.\n\nDirector Walter Salles knew the Paiva family quite well when he was young, and his personal connection shines through in this ode to a family shattered by political turmoil. Fernanda Torres delivers a stunning performance with more emotional depth than just about any other acting performance we&apos;ve seen this year. Salles details that more than 20,000 citizens were tortured and held captive over these years, and via the closing credits he runs archival photos and a recap of history. Seeing the stress and turmoil of a previously happy family is not an easy watch, yet perhaps the accomplishments of Eunice help offset some of the pain.",

When they find themselves with an evening free from the kids, the couple decide to try and revitalise their love-life by filming themselves performing EVERY position from 70s manual The Joy of Sex. The proverbial hits the fan, however, when the couple realise in horror that their current iPad has synced their home-made porn with all of the other tablets they have previously owned-tablets that they have given away as gifts to various friends and associates.\n\nFor most of its running time, Sex Tape smacks of desperation, chucking in as much unsophisticated sexual humour as the R rating will allow, but rarely getting the expected laughs; when Jack Black and Rob Lowe provide a film&apos;s funniest moments, then Houston, we have a problem. Of course, for many men, the biggest lure will undoubtedly be the sight of Diaz in the altogether, and at 42, she still has a very commendable body; unfortunately, facially speaking, she has started to resemble Jack Nicholson in Batman, which is just a bit off-putting-although not nearly as off-putting as Segel&apos;s hairy ass, which gets far too much screen time for my liking. Let&apos;s just say that the sight of Diaz and Segel rutting really ain&apos;t all that sexy.\n\nThe film also suffers from a typically maudlin Hollywood finale in which our adventurous couple&apos;s ordeal helps them to remember just why they fell in love in the first place.

Because, in essence, it is a precise and profound inspired exploration of the themes and cinematography of the thrillers of the last decades. The Asian sensibility is the basic ingredient.

      "reviewBody": "I have to admit, I was horrified to see that someone was remaking the 1964 near-masterpiece.  I had no intention of seeing it, but then I happened to catch Demme and Washington on &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;, and Demme put my mind to rest that he was not trying to remake the original picture.  I was still skeptic, but I decided to have an open mind and check it out for myself.  I&apos;m glad I did.\n\nThe only thing this film has in common with the 1964 film is a political background, a domineering mother, and the brainwashing angle (which is done significantly differently here). This film is about what&apos;s happening now, and it&apos;s as gutsy as any film in today&apos;s political climate can possibly get. The story is told through the inflamed, paranoid POV of a Gulf War veteran who tries to unveil a plot between a corporate hierarchy (that&apos;s involved in the defense industries and medical technologies among other things) and certain politicians who want to stake their influence on a vice presidential nominee.  This &apos;influence&apos; is achieved through the brainwashing of the nominee as well as several soldiers who had been stationed with him in Kuwait.  \n\nPolitical machinery and defense industries have always been dangerous bedfellows, but when the politicians actually have worked in, and have personal interests in those industries, the motivations of such a partnership can be used to exploit the public in all sorts of ominous ways. This film brilliantly places the sort of paranoia that can derive from such precarious matches as a sign of our times.  Consciously or subconsciously, conspiracies are on all of our minds.  Today, because there is so much secrecy in the current administration, no one knows just how terrible OR innocent these guys might really be. And where there is secrecy, there will be conspiracy theories galore.  Paranoia is so commonplace in such a society that it is technically very easy for plots and lies to thrive healthfully. We tell ourselves, &quot;the government is honest and probably has good reasons to keep secrets from the public, so those who see plots and conspiracies must all simply be deluded and paranoid.  Right?&quot;  \n\nThe fact is that politicians can easily lie, and the media, instead of demanding the truth, puts outrageous spins on those lies claiming to present them as &apos;facts&apos;.  This becomes an almost intolerable static that begins to blot out all meaning.  One of the most ingenious things about this film is in its use of that kind of static.  Throughout much of the film, there is a cacophony of radios and TV spewing out their obligatory spins simultaneously, as well as the nearly constant sounds of traffic and people talking over one another.  The people in this movie can hear, but no one is listening.  There&apos;s also a proverbial static between science and technology and the moral questions that remain elusive. The survivors of the brainwashing experiment mentioned above, have little chips implanted in their backs that somehow aid the brainwashers.  The chips could be some sort of homing device, or perhaps some sort of hormone moderator that&apos;s supposed to keep the men in the mental state that makes them more easily susceptible to hypnotic suggestion.  Well, chips that can serve as homing devices, or that can regulate hormones and amino acids such as tryptophan, are in the experimental phase today. In other words, this isn&apos;t way-out science fiction here!\n\nOkay, I know I&apos;m sounding like I&apos;m paranoid and that I&apos;m saying that everything in this film can and will happen.  Don&apos;t worry, I know this is just a movie and that the events depicted in it are EXTREMELY unlikely to ever take place.  What I&apos;m focusing on is how well the film takes themes, facts and situations that are topical and at least emotionally legitimate, and presents them in the context of a whopper of a good thriller.  The film is fresh and audacious and honest in all of its approaches, with the one exception of Meryl Streep who seems to think she&apos;s in a Bette Davis movie. In the original &quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot; Angela Lansbury played her role, and she was appropriately icy, deliberate, and almost iconic in the way she carried her power.  For some reason Streep tried to go to self-consciously comic proportions (you can almost see her winking at the audience saying &quot;don&apos;t you just LOVE how bad I am?&quot;).  The rest of the performances however, are appropriately sober and solid.  I never caught Washington acting, and Schrieber is masterful in the way he consolidates the conscious and subconscious friction of his character&apos;s agony into an invisible but palpable tension.  The score by Rachel Portman is eerily reminiscent of Howard Shore&apos;s score for &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, and just as exciting and effective.  And I can&apos;t help but thrill over Wyclef Jean&apos;s fantastic rendition of the CCR song &quot;Fortunate One&quot;: a version as appropriate to this decade as the original version was to the late sixties (check out the lyrics: replace &apos;senator&apos;s son&apos; with &apos;president&apos;s&apos; son, and see if George W. Bush doesn&apos;t come to mind!).  \n\nFinally, is this film as good as the original version?  They&apos;re so different I honestly can&apos;t compare.  I can only say that this film is as appropriate to the political and sociological climate of today as the original was to its day.  Don&apos;t forget both versions were based on a novel, so comparisons should be made in that context more than anything else (I haven&apos;t read the book so I can&apos;t comment on that).  There are some loopholes in the current film&apos;s plot, and I do love the cinematic style of the original film more than this one. But as I was only a kid when the first film came out, this film has a slightly stronger emotional impression on me than the other one. I only hope all it stays science fiction!"

      "reviewBody": "The Amityville Horror was much better than Boogeyman but still not the best this year. I enjoyed both The Ring Two and Cursed, among others, a little bit more. Don&apos;t get me wrong, Amityville had some genuinely creepy parts, along with some unintentionally funny ones.\n\nGeorge &amp; Kathy Lutz (Ryan Reynolds &amp; Melissa George) unexpectedly find their dream home at the deal-of-a-lifetime price. In fact, it seems to good to be true. George asks the realtor the catch. She exclaims that there were some murders in the house but that did not deter the Lutz&apos;s. Their reasoning being that it would be impossible for a house to cause people to kill.\n\nShortly after moving in, George experiences some strange developments in his health and attitude. Also, their daughter, Chelsea ( Chloë Grace Moretz), makes a new friend who her parents assume in imaginary. These are perhaps some of the creepiest parts of the movie, when the imaginary friend, Jodie (Isabel Conner), becomes visible to the audience and sometimes the cast. The scene with the insanely hot but pretty unlikeable babysitter, Lisa (Rachel Nichols), was pretty good.\n\nThe director, Andrew Douglas, did a good job by showing little differences in George&apos;s attitude and demeanor once he was out of the house. Ryan Reynolds also did a good job of portraying this to the audience. He has come a long way. Melissa George could also leave her mark in Hollywood if the right roles come along for her. I was pretty impressed by her performance almost as much as Ryan&apos;s.\n\nWhile not the best of it&apos;s genre, The Amityville Horror has it&apos;s place amongst horror movies. It is worth seeing, as you can do much worse if you do not do your homework. 8/10"

The idea is based on the main character being able to communicate with his father, who&apos;s been dead for 30 years. His father hears it then, 30 years earlier. They quickly do some things that shouldn&apos;t have happened back then, which then changes the future(or present). The movie deals very well with how they change the future back and forth. The plot is very good, the acting is superb and the characters are all believable. The special effects are very good. The very idea behind the film is very good, but the way it develops so much further is amazing. The ending, while it may seem corny too some, and is, by all means, a bit of a typical Hollywood ending(some might even call it a cop-out), but personally I just think it worked better than anything else could have. I&apos;d recommend this to pretty much anyone who can watch a movie where they have to suspend disbelief, but especially anyone into time-travel or alternate time-lines, as this is, in my opinion, one of the best movies made, concerning this subject. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "`Bend It Like Beckam&apos; is a heartwarming charmer about a young girl&apos;s search for identity in 21st Century England.  Like `Fiddler on the Roof,&apos; `Beckam&apos; deals with the painful struggles tradition-bound cultures must go through as they enter a looser, more freedom-loving modern world.  The culture in this case is that of immigrant and first-generation Indians living in Great Britain.  As with all such tales, it is the young folk who feel the need to pull away from the stuffy values of the past, and who end up dragging the reluctant older folk kicking and screaming into the future right along with them.\n\nJess Bharma is a fairly typical teen with dreams of becoming a world-class soccer player.  However, Jess also comes from a very traditional Indian family that believes a girl should not play around with boys, show her legs in public, or aspire to much beyond marrying a good Indian boy and raising a family.  We&apos;ve seen this kind of set-up countless times before and `Bend It Like Beckam&apos; will certainly not win any prizes for creativity or originality.  It does, however, have a youthful exuberance and a generous spirit that can&apos;t help but captivate even the most diehard, coldhearted cynic.  Parminder K. Nagra is utterly winning as young Jess, capturing all the innate optimism and unquenchable enthusiasm of this irrepressible character.  She receives superb support from a cast of outstanding actors, both young and old, including Keira Knightley as Jules, her inspirational buddy who provides Jess with the opportunity to bring her dreams to fruition; Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Joe, the handsome young coach who provides lessons in love along with lessons in soccer; Anupam Kher as Jess&apos; father, who turns out to have some of his own personal demons to deal with; Shaheen Khan as Jess&apos; mother, who doesn&apos;t understand why her daughter can&apos;t be content with the pre-ordained life her parents have laid out for her; and Juliet Stevenson as Jules&apos; mother, who proves that Indians don&apos;t hold a patent on tradition-obsessed parents.  In its quiet, gentle way, the film also confronts the issue of racism, particularly in terms of how the Indians are often still treated as second-class citizens in British society.\n\nAs directed by Gurinder Chadha, `Bend It Like Beckham&apos; is a light-on-its-feet `feel-good&apos; film that never takes itself too seriously. The movie suffers a bit from a sitcom mentality, as when, for instance, Jules&apos; parents labor under the illusion that their daughter and Jess are actually lesbian lovers.  The plotting, in addition to being predictable at times, often seems contrived and excessively melodramatic (the rivalry between Jess and Jules over Joe being the primary offender).  But this isn&apos;t enough to do any serious damage to the film as a whole.\n\n Thus, if you&apos;re looking for a film that is easygoing, uplifting and comfortably old-fashioned in its demeanor and theme, `Bend It Like Beckham&apos; is for you."

      "reviewBody": "Martin Scorsese once famously said he does one movie for the studio and one for himself, and so do many other directors or actors (George Clooney admits he did Ocean&apos;s Thirteen because that way he could do Michael Clayton next). Although Anne Hathaway hasn&apos;t explicitly said she does that, one can assume it&apos;s the only rational explanation for a piece of anti-cinematic trash like Bride Wars. Shooting The Devil Wears Prada after Brokeback Mountain is one thing, tainting your Oscar-nominated legacy with this bunch of nonsense is another.\n\nAnd yet it sounded like it could be a lot of fun, at least judging by the premise, which reverses the classic wedding stereotype: women are in it for the romance, guys are game because it&apos;s fun (that&apos;s what they make it look like in American comedies, anyway). This time around, the dudes are in it for the love, and the girls want to get married just to make a childhood dream come true. Apparently, if you&apos;re a woman and live in Manhattan, the ultimate dream of your life is to get married at the Plaza in June, so when best friends Liv (Kate Hudson with a Paris Hilton/Britney Spears haircut) and Emma (Hathaway) get asked the fundamental question by their beaus, they immediately try to book the right place and date. A mix-up occurs, and so they&apos;re both stuck with the same date, June 6th. Neither wants to postpone what&apos;s supposed to be the happiest day of their lives, therefore a full-on war is declared on both parts.\n\nAt this point, the real silliness kicks in: diet sabotage, tans gone awry and the occasional witty remark, like &quot;Your wedding&apos;s gonna be huge, just like your ass at prom&quot;. What started as a potentially entertaining critique of materialism and shallowness is revealed to be a poorly executed farce, with a succession of lame jokes instead of a plot (then again, one of the screenwriters is best known for performing on Saturday Night Live, where the skits have no connection whatsoever, so that may be an explanation) and two atrocious caricatures instead of leading ladies.\n\nIn fairness, no one ever expected any true brilliance from Hudson, given the last really good movie she appeared in was Cameron Crowe&apos;s Almost Famous in 2000, but surely someone could have told Hathaway you just don&apos;t choose something this bland after working with Jonathan Demme (or Ang Lee, for that matter). Maybe she wanted to return to her comedic roots, but sadly there&apos;s nothing even remotely funny in Bride Wars, save for a few brief scenes featuring the reliable Candice Bergen. Everything else is just like Liv and Emma: obsessed with getting everything right, but ultimately too self-centered to get any sympathy from others.",

      "reviewBody": "Everyone loves an underdog story. They are done so much in film, and it&apos;s such a common notion that the line is even spoken in the new Dreamworks film &quot;Turbo&quot;. The best part in this instance though is, unlike other movies, it&apos;s genuine. You feel for this animated snail and his new friend a part owner of a taco shop. Both have dreams and do all they can to make them come true, even when their own family doesn&apos;t believe in them. The second best part is that it&apos;s fun for the entire family and could very well be the best animated film of the year.\n\nTheo is a snail who wants to be fast, much like Tom Hanks wanted to be Big and Rocky wanted to be champion. After a freak accident of Spider- Man proportions, he gets his chance to compete in the Indianapolis 500. Along the way he finds a friend and fellow dreamer he never actually speaks with in Tito (Michael Peña). Together they both reach for the impossible dreams that live in us all. The filmmakers of &quot;Turbo&quot; use both wish fulfillment and the belief on oneself to tell a familiar story with most of the troupes we&apos;ve seen before. What sells it here is voice actors ranging from the comedic Ryan Reynolds as Turbo, to the dramatic Paul Giamatti as his brother Chet. In between you have actors that have a foot in both dramatic works as well as comedy, like Luis Guzmàn, Maya Rudolph, Michelle Rodriguez, Richard Jenkins, and Samuel L. Jackson. It also tells its story with a singular goal in mind and still manages to have fun with sight gags, great one-liners, and involvement of the supporting cast.\n\nMy kids loved this film as did I, every year we get so many sequels there&apos;s quite a few this summer alone, and it&apos;s always refreshing to see a movie with the originality and the bravery to take a chance on a story that could have been a bad rip-off of Rocky, but instead reminded me of it in that good way. So go see &quot;Turbo&quot; this weekend, Adam Sandler and his pals have enough of our money, give it to real grown-ups who know how to make really enjoyable films like &quot;Turbo&quot;.\n\n--Robert L. Castillo\n\nhttp://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/"

The acting and directing were mostly fine. Kit Harrington and Emily Browning were passable and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje put in a noteworthy performance. The visuals and effects were by far the best aspect and kept the film very watchable and enjoyable to an extent throughout. The script was poor and most of the usual disaster movie clichés appeared at some point or other but in no way was it as awful as in say, 2012. Overall its probably not something to see at the cinema, but probably worth a watch on DVD or TV at some point. 5/10",

Colin Firth, looking truly handsome, goes through a day of torment with remarkable civility. I felt involved and shaken and couldn&apos;t help but make mine his pain. The flashbacks with Matthew Goode are truly vivid and truthful. This is a step forward in explaining through images that love is love no matter who you are, where you come from or what your circumstances are. It could have been a man and a woman, the fact that it&apos;s a man and a man is almost irrelevant. We recognize the feel of it and Colin Firth&apos;s performance is the magic stroke that makes that not only possible but natural. It is a sensational debut for fashion star Tom Ford. True to himself an artist that promises great, wonderful things for the future. I can&apos;t wait.",

      "reviewBody": "As we approach the turn of the millennium, the Devil seeks to fulfill the prophecies about the birth of the Antichrist, looking for a bride in New York. Directed by Peter Hyams, with a script by Andrew W. Marlowe, this film has Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne and Robin Tunney in the main roles.\n\nOne of the last films of the past millennium, it precisely addresses the end of it and the apocalyptic prophecies about that. It&apos;s a quite grim film, which puts the audience in suspense from the very beginning. The dark picture helps to amplify these feeling, with the most scenes taking place at night or on foggy or rainy days in New York, depicted like a real and decadent &quot;sin city&quot;. The darkest character is undoubtedly the Devil, but the police fighting against him (played by Schwarzenegger) also has to face his own demons: alcohol, deep depression, lack of faith and lack of self-confidence, in a double combat, physical and psychological.\n\nThe film has great action scenes which strangely cohabit with several heavier scenes, almost terror. In fact, this is the major flaw of the film: it lives in a permanent dilemma between terror and action, thriller and suspense. We cannot say it&apos;s a horror movie or a thriller, or action. It&apos;s a mixture of all, which ends up easily displeasing the public looking for just one (particularly the terror lovers, as the film never gets to scare us truly). The climax is very interesting, makes good use of special visual and sound effects, manages to surprise and not be predictable, but some of the effects (the monster) are so &quot;cliché&quot; and far-fetched that destroy what was good.\n\nThe work of the actors is fairly good. This film marks the end of a comedy decade in Schwarzenegger&apos;s career, and he seems convincing in his role and doesn&apos;t make mistakes, giving another proof of versatility. He wanted, truly, show that it&apos;s not only a lot of muscles, and he succeeded. Robin Tunney looks a bit bland and hysterical in the role of Christine. Byrne made an interesting devil, very calm and cold, able to boot chills through the simple look. The soundtrack doesn&apos;t stand out particularly, with the exception of &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;, it&apos;s main music, combining incidental chords with small arrangements of Gregorian chant.",

      "reviewBody": "The Host has an intriguing conceit. It is about a post-apocalypse where aliens take control on every human body then the remaining unpossessed humans fear them despite that these aliens only want peace. The story might have an idea that the humans could be the real enemy here or it&apos;s just both of them. The Sci-Fi bits are pretty interesting but it doesn&apos;t end there. It&apos;s based on a young adult novel so definitely there will be teenage hormones scattered around the context. It has romance that is suppose to save their world and change their lives, but once again just like any other young adult film, the romance is nothing more than a bunch of good looking people falling in love and doing romantic cliché stuff. Love may not be a problem to these stories but this romance is terribly empty. They&apos;re just making out and saying ridiculously cheesy lines. It would have been a fascinating idea but it just can&apos;t get away from its typical teen angst.\n\nIt is kind of similar to the recent young adult novel based film, Warm Bodies, except the antagonists in The Host are virtuous beings instead of ravenous monsters. It seems that both stories have the same morality. Humans are not the most peaceful beings either and maybe the order and mentality of both sides are the reason why they couldn&apos;t get along. When it goes to the romance, it says that Melanie and Wanda&apos;s love between the boys might revolt their world&apos;s condition. But it strays from its plot giving us a lousily told story and romance. Mostly the romance. It is noticeable that most of their &quot;love&quot; only rely on their lips. Which means they kiss a lot. We do not get to know much about why they care for each other, other than being one of the last normal human beings of their age. It is also filled with plot holes because of course it wants to appeal teens for the endless love that didn&apos;t even work. It is directed by Andrew Niccol who is somewhat a Sci-Fi expert but it looks like he&apos;s afraid that too much Sci-Fi than romance might disappoint these children. He could have been more indulgent.\n\nThe film has a solid cast but not all of them standout. Saoirse Ronan plays two roles here and she fills enough heart on both characters. Diane Kruger looks like she is enjoying playing the film&apos;s villain. The roles of Max Irons and Jake Abel seems to be only designed for kissing, slapping, and sometimes strangling, leaving William Hurt being the only likable gentleman of the picture.\n\nThe script explains some points of the concept which is fine in that way in spite of the plot holes but it gets terrible on the romance. There are dialogues that may get way out of hand, ends up being laughable. Even more laughable is one scene when the protagonist tries to wake up her subconscious by kissing her boyfriend. I don&apos;t know if I should blame anyone about it. I mean what choice does she have? Still, it&apos;s ridiculous. The film is at least stunning. It gets to explore something magnificent around. The exteriors serves a lot of intrigue to its world. It features shiny cars and choppers. Most of the action are well shot even though the action itself isn&apos;t really that interesting but everything in the film looks good.\n\nThe Host is not interesting enough. It thematically talks about peace and stuff. Well, you can make peace out of love but the film only shows kissing and I think there is more in love than just making out. Hormonally, this could be a perfect escapism for teens. An apocalyptic world about relationships of these good looking couples with fast awesome cars crashing on the road. But the story seems to offer more. Again, they are unable to show it because the only fan service for adaptations of teen books is to follow every single sequence from the book because they love comparing. Too bad, they could have also shown what&apos;s behind the words as well. The Host is another victim of a generic young adult film adaptation that doesn&apos;t understand much of the meaning of the story, and throw away the most bland of all romances.",

      "reviewBody": "When someone on a trip starts to wig out, you take them someplace quiet and talk soothingly and assure them that everything&apos;s going to be OK. But as the tagline of this film makes clear, for these characters everything is most definitely NOT going to be OK. \n\nFor those who haven&apos;t read the book, it&apos;s important to know what you&apos;re getting into. PK Dick wrote this novel as a way of telling the story of how he and his friends in the early &apos;70s damaged and destroyed themselves with drugs. He tells this story within the framework of a surreal science fiction thriller, but many of the scenes are straight from his own experiences with the unpleasant consequences of people using drugs and disintegrating mentally. \n\nThis film does an amazing job of capturing the feel and tone of the book as well as the paranoia, perceptual distortions, and chaos of hallucinogenic overindulgence. Add to that a story that only gradually emerges from the madness, but by the end brings in a lot of heavy ideas such as the existence of free will, whether ends justify means, etc. There is a sense of consequence to what happens in the film, a sense of despair at what has been lost. So this story of drug-addled losers becomes the story of the human struggle for identity and meaning. \n\nI have a couple of minor quibbles regarding scenes from the book that only partially made the cut (no explanation for the significance of &quot;If I&apos;d known it was harmless I would have killed it myself, no little kid to explain how 6 and 3 gears means 18 speeds). Still, most adaptations of PK Dick stories take a few basic ideas and try to shape them into more conventional films that fit into established genres. Even when it works, such as with Blade Runner or Total Recall, it&apos;s not really PK Dick. Not so this film. This is PK in all his dark and perverse and deeply thoughtful glory.",

      "reviewBody": "Pedro Almodovar&apos;s &quot;Talk to Her&quot; is as suprisingly sweet as it is profoundly disturbing. It is an examination of the nature of love that attempts to challenge our idea of what love is by taking it to its very limits. The lead character is a typical sad sack; slightly disturbed, isolated and sexually inexperienced. He spends his days staring out of his window at a rapturously beautiful dancer, and tries to form a relationship with her by becoming a patient at her father&apos;s psychiatric practice. This eventually leads to disaster when he sneaks into her room to steal an item of hers and finds her just coming out of the shower. But the guy perseveres. After spending years looking after his mother (Who wasn&apos;t an invalid, she just didn&apos;t like moving very much) he gains a degree in nursing and works with camatose patients. To his joy, one of the camatose patients turns out to be the dancer, and so now he can spend all day expressing and demonstrating his love for her. At least, you could see it that way. Or you could see it as an innocent and helpless girl delivered into the hands of a sexual deviant stalker who now can manhandle her and fantacise about her in any way he pleases. I think you can guess by now where the film is heading, and when the ultimate act is committed, Almodovar presents it in such a way as to show the audience how it could be interpreted as an act of love and selflessness. We never see the act itself, only the man&apos;s interpretation of it, and the sequence is, suprisingly, quite funny and, in strange way, touching. But that does not alter the fact that Almodovar is attempting to make rape emotionally acceptable. The film makes this particularly clear by its ending, which, if you have been following this review, I am sure you could also guess. Call me a prude, but I have always felt that love that is only felt by one person is not truly love. True love is something that built by two people by constant attention and care. If I tell someone, &quot;I love you&quot; and she cannot say &quot;I love you too,&quot; then I am only really in love with an illusion, not a person.",

      "reviewBody": "Based on a true story, this film reminds us that addiction is a disease which does not discriminate: it can hit anybody at any time. Indeed, Nic (Timothée Chalamet) does not fit the stereotype of a junkie: raised in a loving upper-middle-class family, he is a good student and shares a close relationship with his father, David (Steve Carell). However, drugs have been part of his life since the age of 12 (alcohol and marijuana at first). The turning point is when he becomes dependent on methamphetamine, at only 18 years old. From that moment on, Nic and his relatives get trapped in a downward spiral. Despite all the support they give him, they are unable to prevent relapses and fear losing him. This movie accurately describes the harmful effects of drugs on family life. It also explores the limits of parental love. Well directed and earnestly performed, « Beautiful boy » is a deeply human drama.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;In the Line of Fire&apos; is one of those Hollywood films that shows up on tv quite a bit, but although I&apos;ve seen it a few times, I usually end up sitting through the whole thing again. Why? - It&apos;s GOOD!   Clint Eastwood is great as usual, and the character he plays is interesting and more fleshed out than usual. The character, Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan, is haunted by the fact that he was on the detail that failed to protect President Kennedy in Dallas, and now he&apos;s forced to match wits with a professional assassin that is openly declaring that he will kill the president. However, the film doesn&apos;t make him a depressed, brooding, and obsessed character. He&apos;s charming and personable, and is realistic as a guy that has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his own skin. He&apos;s even quite convincing when he flirts with the pretty younger agent played by Rene Russo. The killer, played by John Malkovich at his best, is cerebral, deliberate, and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death. He even goes by the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth.\n\n  The film is consistently enjoyable, and it delivers all the goods - suspense, action, romance, and drama - all in their proper amounts. It&apos;s a fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it!",

      "reviewBody": "My friends advised me against watching &apos;Little Children&apos; as they found it very boring. Having liked Todd Field&apos;s previous film &apos;In The Bedroom&apos; and knowing that it had Kate Winslet and Jennifer Connelly (whose works I very much admire alongside their beauty), I decided to watch it anyway. The poster was a put-off as the tagline stated: Twin Peaks meets Desperate Housewives. I hate such taglines where the movie concerned is being compared to other films, TV series or whatever. On top of that, I am no fan of &apos;Desperate Housewives&apos;. However I found the trailer appealing as it gave the impression that it was a dark film about a married couple (Connelly and Wilson) and the other woman (Winslet), it appealed to me. Only later I will find out that I&apos;ve been deceived.\n\nSadly, &apos;Little Children&apos; is not as great as I had expected. The idea of juggling too stories did not seem fitting and on top of that the film drags a lot. On one side there&apos;s a story about a married couple, in which the husband has an affair with a married woman. On the other side there&apos;s a story about a &apos;child molester&apos; who has just moved in with his mother to an unwelcoming neighborhood and to make things worse, he is constantly harassed by an ex-copper. Both stories are interesting but would have faired better in two films rather than being squeezed as one. In addition to that, the ending of the first story does not convince. It seemed a little too abrupt, as if the director was in a hurry to wrap it up. It looks as though the writers tried to tackle too many ideas. The voice-over seems pointless. Some editing would have stopped the film from dragging.\n\nOn the brighter side, I found the visuals very impressive. The frames are quite well done and the cinematography is superb. The sound adds to the feeling of loneliness and the soundtrack and background score is beautiful. Overall, the film does look polished. It does achieve the satirical feel but somehow loses it.\n\nAnd, of course, what would &apos;Little Children&apos; be without the solid performances? Kate Winslet is electrifying as Sarah Pierce. Patrick Wilson is quite alright. Sadly, Jennifer Connelly has little to do but just in that one scene at the dinner table (with Sarah and Brad) she proves again what an excellent actress she is. Jackie Earle Haley too stands out in a difficult role while Noah Emmerich is loud at times but okay otherwise. Phyllis Somerville shines.\n\nWhile I noticed that many people felt that &apos;Little Children&apos; was vulgar because of the sex scenes. I thought the scenes were quite sensual and contributed well to the film. I do not understand why people have a problem with the character Ronnie being someone you can sympathize with rather than hate. I liked that the character was portrayed as a flawed human who knows that he has a problem rather than some kind of a monster. There are a few disturbing sequences which can irritate some people. \n\nTo sum it up, &apos;Little Children&apos; is like two films in one...where it would have been better as two. At times it appears to be pretentious and the lethargic pace does not help. However, it has its moments, great performances, a dazzling soundtrack, fine camera-work and makes its point (even though it could have done that more effectively)."

      "reviewBody": "Remember when Ewan McGregor played in a little movie called Trainspotting? The film was made after a book by Scottish writer Irvine Welsh and it was an intense and often funny window into the complete wasting of human life due to heroin. It made McGregor famous.\n\nNow, James McAvoy has no need to be made famous, he already is, and he showed he is a great actor in several movies; he is on a roll. But in this film, also made from an Irvine Welsh book, he really outdid himself, playing a deranged police inspector torn apart by addiction, grief and madness.\n\nThe film itself is difficult to explain and, perhaps, it would be more clear to me if I would have read the book first. Some of the characters I have no idea who they were and why he was interacting with them in the first place. Also the ending is pretty much the antithesis of the one in Trainspotting. Here, there is no hope.\n\nThe direction was good, I guess, as well as the general production values. A bunch of known, but usually secondary actors fill the cast, with often interesting results, but let&apos;s face it, the film is mostly a one man show and McAvoy was up for the job. I just wish the story would have been less confusing.\n\nConclusion: it would be a shame not to watch this film, even if you end up not liking it for some reason. You need to be familiar with Scottish accents or use a subtitle to get what people are saying. Other than that, great work, James!",

      "reviewBody": "Wow!, what a film anyone who has seen this film would definetly agree with me that  this film touches you in so many different places. It&apos;s funny, sad but also appealing to so many different people. Dustin Hoffman is superb in it, so is Jessica Lange the way they act on set together is very amusing but when they are alone, it&apos;s always an emotional scene. Especially the scene in which Julie (Lange) throws a glass of champagne at him when he tries to come on to her at a party, it&apos;s so funny. Murray is also good as Hoffman&apos;s mixed-up flat mate. Sydney Pollack the director also takes a small role as Hoffman&apos;s Agent who unsuccesfully tries to find him work. The viewer sees the struggle of all the characters in their everyday life. There is also a touch of romance in the fim for the sentimentals in this world. The whole team bonds together to create a funny, imaginative film suitable for anyone who is in the mood for a laugh or a cry. I thouroughly reccomend it!!"

      "reviewBody": "Designed as a prequel to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (and MANHUNTER before it), this is a film that aims to show how Hannibal Lecter ended up as the human cannibal that we all know and fear. Many people criticised this film, arguing that familiarity breeds contempt and the more we learn about a killer&apos;s background and origin, the less frightening he becomes. They have a point, but they&apos;re also missing something: HANNIBAL RISING is a very well made and entertaining movie in its own right. My advice is to forget all about the connections with the later films and just enjoy this film on its own merits.\n\nIt&apos;s a distinctly European film with a European sensibility and a young, French, unknown lead actor. It has a level of classiness that&apos;s not present in many an American film; a sheen of quality that sets it apart from the rest. The opening sequence, set in the latter days of World War 2 and detailing horrific events in Lithuania, is very well handled, full of foreboding, great effects, and sinister actions. It ably sets up the rest of the film, which turns out to be a revenge flick with the added intrigue of having the main character becoming more and more sick and twisted as the movie progresses.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the quality of the cast. The unknown Gaspard Ulliel is weird and brilliant as the young killer, and you quite believe he&apos;s a sociopath. There&apos;s a romantic sub-plot that goes nowhere involving the lovely Gong Li (CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER) but it does serve to humanise the monster a bit. The ever-reliable Dominic West is also very good as the policeman investigating Hannibal&apos;s crimes, although his role is completely extraneous to the thrust of the film. The bad guys, too, are very well cast and all of them thoroughly despicable chaps: Kevin McKidd, Richard Brake, and in particular a cast-against-type Rhys Ifans all make an impact here.\n\nThe violence that plays out is entertaining because the villains all deserve it: from the butcher slashed apart with a samurai sword to the guy strangled and eaten, these men are repulsive and their deaths well earned. Another highlight is that the film doesn&apos;t focus on the gore, either, not in a repulsive way like HANNIBAL; there&apos;s nothing stomach churning here. The cannibalism ends up as a sub-plot, really, not involved with the main film, but that didn&apos;t bother me too much. I enjoyed the pacing, the acting and the direction, and found all three of those elements assured and designed to entertain.",

      "reviewBody": "The first 40 minutes, I was excited &amp; impressed. I like James McAvoy, I think he&apos;s a really good &amp; charismatic actor. And Vincent Cassel, in my opinion, always delivers. The movie pumps you up with an intriguing storyline, flashy &amp; artsy camera shots &amp; angles, thrilling scenes backed up with a really good musical score. Then enter Rosario Dawson. It has been a steady downward spiral from that point on. No, it&apos;s not because of her, although I thought she looked a bit tired 90 % of the film. It&apos;s the plot and the shameful use of hypnotherapy as the driving force of the whole movie. Hypnotherapy as the structure of the movie? That makes the plot shaky at best. The moment Rosario inserted herself in the scheme I found myself shaking my head more and more. \n\nTrance almost had everything that makes a movie work. Good cast, great direction, interesting cameraworks, good editing, stylish neo-noir execution, and really great music. Unfortunately, like poor Tin Man without the heart and The Lion without courage, this one has a weak script which essentially takes away the soul of the movie. It&apos;s a classic case of style-over-substance, easily disguised as a mind-bending intellectual movie with the use of &quot;is this real?&quot; sequences, change of perspective, and thrill rides, that can masterfully dupe the audience into thinking that they&apos;re watching Leo with a Spotless Mind. \n\nDanny Boyle has style, that&apos;s for sure, but he should have given equal attention to the plot as he did to his camera shots &amp; artsy vibe of the whole film. It&apos;s not at all bad, the music and style is enough reason to enjoy this movie and send you in a 100-minute trance-like state, but after the credits roll, like a snap of a finger, you wake up after that trippy ride, shake your head, look around, and mutter, &quot;Seriously?&quot;",

I also liked the plot, one where a mysterious young woman named Katie (Julianne Hough) escapes from somewhere and arrives in a delightful town called Southport, North Carolina. The town, itself, feels like you could live there. Although the Katie character is so secretive about the reason why she&apos;s there, she has bits and pieces of memories of a life she left behind, but as she falls in love with a store owner named Alex (Josh Duhamel), everything comes to a head. The few characters were great and supporting actors. Sadly, it was noted that this was actor Red West&apos;s final role before he passed away in 2017.",

The children at first seem bored, not wanting to hear any more about The Third Reich and Nazism. The teacher is surprised. &quot;We&apos;re too knowledgeable to ever fall into something like that again,&quot; say the students. The teacher then decides to show the children what it&apos;s like to live in an autocracy, and sets up a simple experiment in class. They elect a leader (him) and he begins to instill in them (merely as an example) the virtues and practices that accompany an autocracy (&quot;Strength through discipline&quot;, &quot;Work as one&quot;). The students take to it, and become obsessed with it. Soon, what was a simple classroom experiment grows to a social entity all it&apos;s own, with the teacher not sure if he can reverse the effects.\n\nThe film was very well acted and written, and was seriously creepy. It showed how - easily a society could fall into fascism, if presented to the society in the correct way. Watching the film, I understood why the students enjoyed the new system, but was also privy to the horrors that come with it. A shocking and powerful film. The way the different children reacted and how such a seemingly innocent experiment profoundly affected their lives was incredible and horrifying. Vogel gives a powerful performance as an idealistic teacher who isn&apos;t aware of the influence he has on others. Worth seeing.",

It highlights the harsh realities of children in impoverished settings, focusing on parental irresponsibility and systemic failures. The film explores resilience, empathy, and humanity amidst chaos. Its raw, unflinching portrayal has evoked strong emotional responses, with many praising its powerful message and realistic depiction of slum life. However, some find the intense subject matter overwhelming and distressing.",

      "name": "A film which dares to ask: if you live in poverty, is it moral to have children?",
      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s the missing question in the often heated debates about child poverty - I hear it all the time in my own country (UK) - has it risen? Should the government be doing more to help? How can a developed country tolerate children growing up in squalor? The question that is never asked, that is in fact completely taboo to even suggest, is why are people living in poverty having children? And is that moral?\n\nIt is the question asked by Zain, the protagonist of this superb film, who decides to sue his parents for having him. Having endured a lifetime of neglect, abuse and poverty he thinks no, and asks the court to prevent his parents from having anymore children.\n\nThat sets the film rolling, the vast majority of which takes place in flashback as we see how Zain ended up in court. Along the way we see the grim reality of life in the slums of Beirut, as Zain eventually decides to run away after his parents sell off his older (11 year old) sister in marriage to their landlord. He ends up living with an undocumented Ethiopian migrant who lives in a shack with her baby, and Zain ends up looking after the child while the mother works. This provides a counterpoint in many ways to the earlier scenes, as the threesome establish something akin to the warm loving home Zain had never known. But yet again, the films forces us to ask - why has this woman had a child? Though employed, she lives in squalor, and as an illegal migrant her child will never be able to get an education, as a local people trafficker trying to persuade her to sell the child reminds her. Is this moral? Does her right to have a child trump that of the child&apos;s right for a decent start in life?\n\nThe films develops from there, though I cannot reveal anymore without spoiling the final act. Though this isn&apos;t really a plot-driven film per se, more a slice-of-life look at Zain and how he deals with the situations life throws at him. This film reminded me very much of &apos;Salaam Bombay&apos;, Mira Nair&apos;s 1987 film which deals with street children in Mumbai.\n\nIt&apos;s a brave film and the only other film I can think of which tackles this issue is Ken Loach&apos;s &apos;Ladybird Ladybird&apos;, in which an impoverished woman with a chaotic home-life repeatedly gets pregnant. There I think Loach approached his protagonist from a more sympathetic perspective, seeing her as a victim of an unfair economic system and social forces beyond her control. Though I may be misreading her intention, Nadine Labaki takes this further and asks - is it basically selfish for people in these circumstances to have children?\n\nPersonally speaking - should the government (whether in rich or poor countries) be doing more to alleviate poverty? Yes. Is the economic system both within and between states currently too unequal? Yes. If you are stuck in poverty, dealing with poor mental health, drug addiction, illiteracy, malnutrition, slum-living condition - that sucks, and is unfair. But one thing you should not be doing is bringing children into that situation and thereby perpetuating the cycle of misery. Yes, some children rise above their circumstances, but the vast majority don&apos;t, and are thereby condemned to a miserable life through no fault of their own. It&apos;s the height of selfishness. This is the provocative question Labaki and Zain pose in this engrossing film.",

But Angel Has Fallen came at the perfect time, end of August/early September when there&apos;s not much else out in theaters, at least blockbuster movie wise. While not better than the first entry &apos;Olympus Has Fallen&apos;, it is certainly superior to &apos;London Has Fallen&apos; from 2016, and it makes for a nice cap to the &apos;Has Fallen&apos; trilogy. That is, if this is the end to the series. And look, there&apos;s a ceiling to Gerard Butler&apos;s acting talent, but he&apos;s more than serviceable in a role like this and last year&apos;s Den of Thieves. Oh and Nick Nolte? He&apos;s so dang good in this movie it feels like he&apos;s on an entirely different level than everyone else. I&apos;m here for it.\n\n7.0/10",

Even though its final 20 minutes somewhat go off the rails a bit, overall A CURE FOR WELLNESS is stunning, bold and hypnotic.\n\nDane DeHaan plays an ambitious young executive, Lockhart, sent to retrieve his company&apos;s missing CEO who&apos;s decided to stay at a remote wellness center in the Swiss Alps. What is supposed to be an easy assignment turns into a journey of slowly but surely uncovering the center&apos;s dark past, uncovering the real reasons as to why the guests keep staying there, longing for the cure, as Lockhart himself starts to question his own sanity.\n\nYou will fall in love with the cinematography by DP Bojan Bazelli. Even if you&apos;re not a fan of mystery or suspense, Bazelli&apos;s cinematography for &quot;A Cure For Wellness&apos; will leave you floored, the word breathtaking doesn&apos;t even begin to fairly describe it. There are shots through the tunnel, around the castle, and even during some of the film&apos;s most disturbing moments, they draw you in, gorgeous in every possible way. And the fact that they actually filmed a big chunk on location at Castle Hohenzollern in Germany does help because the place becomes a supporting role.\n\nEver since &quot;Chronicle,&quot; Dane DeHaan has been an actor that&apos;s caught my attention because I do believe that this rising star has what it takes to be great, A CURE FOR WELLNESS allows him to showcase a tease of that potential. His performance reminds me of Leo DiCaprio&apos;s in &quot;Shutter Island&quot; and Jack Nicholson&apos;s in &quot;The Shining&quot; where to a certain extent, you&apos;re not certain if they&apos;d eventually cross that line or remain on this side of the fence. A CURE FOR WELLNESS is trippy, it&apos;s intriguing, it&apos;s filled with all kinds of odd imagery, it&apos;s definitely not for the faint of heart. It&apos;s a sensory experience type of a film, the kind that also evokes all sorts of questions about society and what it means to live well and the ambition for purity. But again, as I said earlier, the final 20 minutes do go off the rails a bit, by that time the film feels like it runs longer than it should and furthermore it gets ruined by its desire to leave us on a happy note. A CURE FOR WELLNESS will find its audience, but it&apos;s an acquired taste.",

      "name": "Black Comedy From Gore Verbinski",
      "reviewBody": "A couple working on the give-and-take aspects of their relationship, an exquisitely crafted antique pistol with something of a diverse history and some questions concerning who is working for whom, all figure prominently in `The Mexican,&apos; a black comedy directed by Gore Verbinski and starring Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt.  Jerry Welbach (Pitt), a somewhat less than astute young fellow in thrall to a criminal currently incarcerated, is given a seemingly simply assignment:  He is to go to Mexico, where he will rendezvous at a bar in a small town, at which time he will take possession of an invaluable hand-made pistol; he will then transport the item to the States and deliver it to his boss.  But there&apos;s a problem; his girlfriend, Samantha (Roberts) expects to go to Las Vegas at the same time, and their plans were already made and set in stone.  So what is a guy to do?  After Sam throws him out of their apartment and Jerry tries to explain-- in a memorable scene with her on the second story balcony, he on the ground looking up-- that if he doesn&apos;t do this job they will, well, KILL him, it doesn&apos;t make any difference.  After all, their trip to Vegas had already been planned, and he promised it would happen.  Talk about a guy between a rock and a hard place.  And it&apos;s only the beginning of a dark comedy of errors and circumstances that ultimately involves them with some double dealings and brings them into contact with a psychotic killer named Leroy (James Gandolfini). \tDirector Verbinski lends a nice touch to the movie, eliciting noteworthy performances from his actors and establishing early on his method of using specific landmarks-- a traffic signal and a cross-roads in the middle of nowhere, for example-- that give context and definition to what is happening, sometimes off-screen (as in the opening scene, when you only `hear&apos; a traffic accident that becomes a pivotal part of the story).  He avoids slapstick and plays up the natural, subtle humor that drives the film.  The characters are well drawn and the dialogue is clever and witty (`You Forrest Gumped&apos; your way through this...&apos;) and often very droll.  And he maintains a pace and develops an atmosphere in which the unexpected can be expected that keeps it all moving along nicely and right on track.  And there&apos;s a politically incorrect sensibility to the movie that is refreshing to see; in real life certain situations and cultures that are foreign to us are often viewed in stereotypical terms, so there is no reason to portray it otherwise in a film, especially when care has been taken to present it in an inoffensive manner, as it is here. \tTaking on a decidedly unglamorous role, Roberts nevertheless creates a lively character with Sam, imbuing her with plenty of spunk and, of course, that trademark smile.  It&apos;s not a part that calls for a lot of depth, but she makes Sam likable and fun to watch, and she makes her banter with Jerry and Leroy credible and engaging.  Credit goes to Pitt, as well, for making the most of what is actually a leading man/character role; Jerry isn&apos;t the sharpest tool in the shed and he may be easily distracted, but-- like Sam-- he&apos;s not without some natural charm that makes him quite personable and interesting.  And there is a chemistry between the two that makes their relationship believable, especially when the sparks are flying.  Gandolfini, meanwhile, not to be outdone by his charismatic co-stars, makes an indelible mark as the sensitive, psychotic killer who turns out to be something of an enigma. \tThe supporting cast includes Bob Balaban (Nalin), David Krumholtz (Beck), Luis Felipe Tovar (Luis) and Gene Hackman (Margolis).  A lively romp that takes some unexpected turns, `The Mexican&apos; has a dark side, but manages to remain uplifting and thoroughly entertaining.  There&apos;s a natural flow to the film and the laughs, generated by both the situations and the characters, are never forced but prompted, rather, by the spontaneity of it all.  It&apos;s a movie that never pretends to be anything other than what it is, which is pure entertainment.  It&apos;ll leave you with a smile on your face, some chuckles and some great lines to quote.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",

The first half or so is fairly linear (despite the frenzied Altman-esque style of everyone talking on top of each other), but then it gets WEIRD and it just absolutely blew me away. This film won a major Sundance award, and normally that means I won&apos;t like it (especially the normally pandering audience award winners) but this movie, and first-time filmmaker Shane Carruth, deserves absolutely everything it gets. I am just blown away.\n\nDid you like Pi? If so, go see this one.\n\nBy the way, the attention to detail in the beginning is great. Often in thrillers with technical content, if you have a technical education you have consciously ignore all the stupid movie crud that they pull to make it into a good story. But this movie pulls off an incredibly believable technical story, with only a few distracting gaffs. That is, the tech jargon is good enough that you don&apos;t get distracted and can focus on the story line.\n\nFinal comment: Yes, it is very hard to follow the story line in this movie.\n\nObviously I&apos;m not going to spoil it, but I think the following fact will help when the movie gets kind of hairy towards the end: Aaron is the dark-haired guy, Abe is the blond-haired guy.\n\nThis movie now has distribution and you should keep an eye out for it in the fall."

After about ten times I could remember who killed who and why, plus what their dark secret was. Once you have it down, you can have fun paying attention who is not in the room (because they are killing another) and how they are able to sneak away from their partner, kill someone, and come back un noticed. The end is a little hard to follow (Mr Boddy was really the butler, Wadsworth was really Mr. Boddy) and it is annoying watching Wadsworth retell the events in a fast-forwarded version with all three endings. The acting and casting of parts is exceptional. It is a fun movie that most people will enjoy. Having three unique endings distinguishes this movie from all others. The final ending, and the reasons behind everything, is hysterical. You cannot see this movie just once... You need to see it atleast two, three, four times to pay attention to detail!"

    "description": "When tech billionaire Slater King meets cocktail waitress Frida at his fundraising gala, he invites her to join him and his friends on a dream vacation on his private island. As strange things start to happen, Frida questions her ...",
    "summary": "Reviewers say 'Blink Twice' delves into power, manipulation, and female empowerment, reminiscent of 'Get Out' and 'Glass Onion'. The film's sinister island retreat narrative critiques wealth and privilege. Psychological tension and dark humor are highlighted, with praise for Naomi Ackie and Channing Tatum's performances. The ending is divisive, with mixed opinions on its satisfaction. Zoë Kravitz's direction and cinematography are lauded, though script and character development receive criticism. Overall, 'Blink Twice' is an ambitious film with a compelling premise and mixed execution.",

A different story and point entirely.\n\nI am still thinking about it and trying to reconcile in my mind why did they end it that way? It does not seem like the intention or maybe the general message of the rest of the film.\n\nIs the ending supposed to be a statement of society, or a fantasy that we were supposed to be excited about? I don&apos;t know. It seemed contrived and trying to be edgy and I just wish something more practical happened with our main characters.\n\nThat ending wasn&apos;t justice. And it wasn&apos;t empowering. It was unsettling.\n\nReguardles, this film may make you really feel some intense emotions, as you figure out what is going on and I think they executed that very well. Everyone in this acted in a way that really impressed me and showed a lot of intent with just their body language in many scenes. I felt a lot more than I heard, and that was a very immersive experience.\n\nI would have given this movie a 9, if it weren&apos;t for that ending. And I hope there one day is some other cut released that has almost anything else happening to these 2 main characters. It seems so out of place and fast, it makes you think it was merely an interchangeable afterthought, to what was a really interesting story and plot (during the majority of the movie) ."

      "reviewBody": "If you think of &quot;Four weddings and a Funeral&quot; or &quot;Notting Hill&quot;, you will be a little disappointed, being here the overall tone not so brilliant, dialogues not so sparkling, however, the both humorous and moving atmosphere of Richard Curtis&apos;s comedies is still recognizable.\n\nI think the real protagonist in &quot;The boat that rocked&quot; is music, that sound pop-rock that in the 60&apos;s began to move the world, and to be opposed by the establishment as a dangerous weapon in the hands of the multitudes, as a threat to a well consolidated but no longer valid system. Among unreal situations, a totally-lacking plot, among odd and eccentric characters, what only matters is that power of music to revive one&apos;s spirits, to give voice to the most uncontrolled, animal, ancestral instincts of man. And thus becomes, in my opinion, the most vivid scene that of those hundreds of records floating on the water, the symbol of a generation, of an era that was then ready to explode, and that no strict establishment could have wiped away, even once illegal radio stations were shut down.\n\nNo revolutionary message is conveyed: it&apos;s a good-humoured and at intervals melancholic tribute to a generation who, maybe ingenuously, but deeply, and truly believed in out of time-values, friendship, respect, love, and believed that music was a strong, and powerfully effective means to convey them. Even if you don&apos;t belong to that generation, each of us has experienced, one or more times in one&apos;s life, the communion of a piece of music with the most sensitive chords of our soul: it&apos;s about something emotional, but also physical and that&apos;s what the director just wants to celebrate. \n\nIf you are fond of music, or simply you have once in your life been moved by a song, you will like this movie, or at least enjoy it for what it is, without the necessity of too much criticism.",

      "reviewBody": "Before there was &quot;Snakes on a Plane,&quot; there was &quot;Anaconda,&quot; a Hollywood B-movie from the late 90&apos;s that is as notorious for its mixed bag of actors as it is for the gruesome snakes that populate its plot. In the film, a group of documentary film-makers traveling through the Amazon jungle picks up a mysterious man who inadvertently becomes their tour-guide on an unexpected detour. It seems the man is totally crazy and intends to capture one of the Amazon&apos;s most notorious and deadliest inhabitants: The Anaconda.\n\nDespite some bad looking CGI-snakes (not bad in a good way) and a horribly mis-matched cast (J-Lo and Eric Stolz? Really?) &quot;Anaconda&quot; is simply a good, dumb time. Without a doubt, it&apos;s an utterly ridiculous film that can be insulting to your intelligence, but thankfully it knows not to overstay its welcome and the 90 minutes it takes up makes for a harmless and amusing ride. Ice Cube plays Ice Cube as he always does, while J-Lo turns in one of her more likable roles. You&apos;ll also catch Owen Wilson in one of his earliest roles, and John Voight is a pleasure to watch as he eats up the scenery. But face it, this movie is about snakes, and the titular character is the true star here. Surely, the actors on hand have done much worse, and as far as horror/b-movies about snakes, you could pick up much worse yourself. If you enjoy watching giant snakes (who inexplicably scream) stalk rappers, pop-stars and Angelina Jolie&apos;s dad, this is the flick for you. Those seeking genuine thrills, however, may find the film coming up a bit short.",

      "reviewBody": "As a last film for a truly legendary director, Before The Devil Knows You&apos;re Dead can only be described as a haunting, underrated masterpiece that any viewer will not soon forget. \n\nThe film consists of an all-star cast, including the likes of the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. Even Michael Shannon shares a brief, but memorable, bit of run time. The casting was excellent all around and there were no characters that felt out of place or unnecessary to the story. Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke specifically were the best either of them have ever been. The solid script and carefully written dialogue shared between the two main characters delivers some of the film&apos;s most riveting moments. And the &quot;car scene&quot; is one of Hoffman&apos;s most memorable on-screen moments. Those of you who have seen the film will know what I am referring to and those unaware are in for a treat.\n\nThe story, while simple and admittedly not too original, manages to effectively show the characters&apos; descent into violence and madness while jumping to before and after the event in which the movie revolves around. While sometimes the movie holds our hand a little too much with the story telling, I appreciated the fact that this movie wanted us to never be confused or lost within the time-jumping narrative. I was always aware of where our characters were and what point of the story I was witnessing.\n\nNow I have seen many comparisons between this film and the masterpiece known as Fargo, and while it shares the same theme of &quot;simple crime gone horribly wrong&quot; Before The Devil Knows You&apos;re Dead is not a darkly comedic venture. In fact, this movie is rarely anything but somber and hopeless. This is not a bad thing though as it seems that this was the director&apos;s intent. Delivering a powerful message through spurts of violence and intensity while never straying from the realm of reality within the movie. The violence and thrills are handled very well and are, at times, extremely intense.\n\nNow with all that said, there is only one thing that stopped the movie from being perfect and that is the ending. Normally when following characters throughout a movie we like to see how their story ends. It is common in all basic story telling. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough, especially if we are following a certain character throughout the entire film. Viewers want to know what happened to the character they have been following for the past two hours, but this movie denies you of that. It leaves the fate of the character out of view, and while that works for some movies, I sadly don&apos;t think it was the right choice here. Seeing all the things that this character has gone through and leaving it unfinished before the movie is over feels incredibly abrupt and doesn&apos;t fit with the rest of the movie. \n\nDespite this issue, Before The Devil Knows You&apos;re Dead is a masterpiece from a truly talented director. A tight written script brought together by superb acting and thrills, this is definitely a movie you should make time for.",

After all their can be only one Indy.\n\nBut in this case we&apos;ve a pair of cowboy cops who work in different parts of Los Angeles. Sylvester Stallone as Ray Tango and Kurt Russell as Gabe Cash are certainly known to each other however due to the headlines they&apos;ve gathered smashing various criminal enterprises. They&apos;re also known to master criminal Jack Palance the Professor Moriarty of the film and he&apos;s rigged one elaborate plan for their disgrace and downfall and death.\n\nAs much as Stallone and Russell are enjoying spoofing their own action images, this film is absolutely stolen by Jack Palance. With tongue firmly in cheeking and hands twirling some imaginary mustache ends in the best Snidely Whiplash tradition, Palance is having a ball with his part.\n\nOf course even when they&apos;re in the worst of trouble there&apos;s still that oneupsmanship that Russell and Stallone can&apos;t shake. And when Russell shows an interest in Teri Hatcher whom he later finds out is Stallone&apos;s sister, things could really have gotten interesting if it weren&apos;t for the joint problems they both were having.\n\nWhen you watch this film, do not for one instant take it seriously and I guarantee a real hoot.",

This is somewhat a surprise as it is famous for having a character with an alternative lifestyle. However, it is not really a surprise when I give it more thought, because the first film was mostly about them seducing each other. After watching &quot;Fifty Shades Darker&quot;, I think it really is a romantic film. It does not get any darker, just sweeter with every minute. Both Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson are very attractive. Christian Grey&apos;s penthouse is very stylish and modern, I wish I could live there! I enjoyed watching this film. I wonder what the third one will be like."

It&apos;s a nasty movie with great pace and a strong spine thanks to those two prolific leads. Although it does have some flaws and may drag in between scenes, though as an action thriller it provides the necessary thrills and interest for the viewers.",

But the effects are amazing and the vision of heaven is very original. Robin Williams is, as always, very good at performing. This was the first serious movie I saw featuring Williams, and I was amazed. I had thought Williams would be the type who could only act decently in comedies, but this one proved me wrong. He can put down a serious character with all ease not only that, he can truly touch you with his oh so tear-jerking lines.\n\nMy conclusion: if you are planning on watching this movie, keep your tissues at hand, and some food and drinks as well since the movie isn&apos;t exactly what you call short.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;House of Flying Daggers (Shi mian mai fu)&quot; shows they can make movies like that anymore. This is a grand action love story that fully captures the eye and the heart, the pulse and ears. Yes, an action flick can be a date movie! \n\nWhile building on the Wu-Xia tradition of literature and film that&apos;s as much historical fantasy as any rollicking Dumas adventure or the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films, director Yimou Zhang incorporates elements we have seen elsewhere into a freshly thrilling experience. \n\n&quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; had a more sophisticated plot, but this one&apos;s twisty enough in the ever more duplicitous spies/hunter and the hunted vein. \n\nIt has a lot of plot similarities to another Ziyi Zhang-starrer, the drama of 1930&apos;s war intrigue &quot;Purple Butterfly (Zi hudie),&quot; minus the political lessons. \n\nFrom Japanese films there&apos;s borrowing from the &quot;Zatôichi: The Blind Swordsman&quot; legends as well as almost as much from Kurasawa&apos;s &quot;Hidden Fortress&quot; that Lucas did for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga, and then borrowing forest fighting imagery from Lucas to an open meadow as magical as in &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot; \n\n&quot;The Matrix&quot; movies may have wowed us more with &quot;bullet time&quot; plus there is a lot of following arrow trajectories as in &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,&quot; not coincidentally as the titular rebels are stealing from the rich to benefit the poor, but the context of the weapons for Siu-Tung Ching&apos;s martial arts choreography are more varied and emotional. \n\nBaz Luhrmann&apos;s &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is only a bit more over the top than the beautiful production design and elaborate costumes in this Peony Pavilion, but every inch of the screen and soundtrack is as operatically filled and should be experienced on a large screen. \n\nThe director&apos;s own &quot;Hero (Ying xiong)&quot; is more beautiful as this is missing cinematographer Christopher Doyle&apos;s aesthetics but Xiaoding Zhao&apos;s cinematographical debut captures a breathtaking variety of landscapes in straightforward storytelling. The sound design is as important, with lots of heavy breathing from tension and exertion. \n\nWhile it&apos;s a much smaller cast than sweeping epics like &quot;Dr. Zhivago,&quot; &quot;Titanic&quot; or &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; it has that swept away feel of a love story amidst larger forces, even if for much of the movie its the force of nature of the geography of Ukraine and a bamboo forest national park, which forcefully reminded me of an elementary school unit my son&apos;s class did on how bamboo is stronger than steel. \n\n&quot;Warriors of Heaven and Earth (Tian di ying xiong)&quot; showed that spectacular scenery can be a backdrop for a pedestrian movie. But like &quot;Hero,&quot; the enormous canvas is background for zooming in on three enormously charismatic actors in a passionate and unexpectedly tricky love triangle.\n\nZiyi Zhang needs to watch someone other than Mary Pickford, especially some Susan Sarandon or Jeanne Moreau, to learn that there&apos;s more levels in projecting romance than smoldering ratcheting right up to jump his bones, but one has to make some allowances as this is the first as sexy as this Chinese movie and the romance does recall pre-Code Hollywood. Her beautiful shoulders are used quite provocatively.\n\nTakeshi Kaneshiro is ravishingly captivating but Andy Lau gives him a run for your heart in surprises that revolve around the unusual plot point of a woman&apos;s willingness being paramount, which is refreshing and adds suspense and emotion to the story. \n\nThe closing Kathleen Battle song is a bit over the top, as the music throughout verges on schmaltzy as it shamelessly reinforces what you see and hear, but you are left gasping if not weeping at the end anyway."

      "reviewBody": "Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is the &apos;sequel&apos; of Journey to the Centre of Earth (starring Brendan Fraser). Actually, I really don&apos;t know why they consider it a sequel because the story is completely different – the only similarities are the author of the books in which the films were based on (Jules Verne) and the character of Sean Anderson that appears in both movies. I also found interesting that many people didn&apos;t know it was related to the other movie.\n\nWhat we have here is a film that follows the same scheme of its predecessor – a lot of CGI and 3D effects, amazing and colorful scenarios, silly humor and nothing more. Journey 2 is a movie for all ages - specially the kids - so don&apos;t expect violent sequences or sex scenes with your favorite stars. \n\nThe plot is traditional and there is obviously those parallel stories - like the boy Sean(Josh Hutcherson) who falls in love with the charming Khailani (Vanessa Hudgens) and his relationship with his mother&apos;s boyfriend, Hank – played by Dwayne &apos;The Rock&apos; Johnson who shows us that the &apos;tough guys&apos; can also be funny, charismatic and do movies that they don&apos;t have to kill a hundred people. \n\nSo, are you thinking about taking your kids to the movies? Well, take them to watch Journey 2: The Mysterious Island - they will be thrilled by it.\n\nBut, even if you don&apos;t have any kids, watch it. Who said that adults have only to watch serious and artistic movies? Sometimes a little bit of unpretentious fun is necessary in life - and this movie provides it (at least for me it did).",

      "reviewBody": "Fun, funny, and raunchy. This is the dirtiest film Adam Sandler has ever made. And I&apos;m not some idiot who likes every Adam Sandler movie.* This movie has lots of laughs. At the advanced screening, people were laughing so loudly that I sometimes couldn&apos;t hear the next line. If you like immature, silly movies (like Sandler&apos;s most popular work), then this is a great movie. This is the kind of film that Adam Sandler has always been capable of making even though he chose to take a break so he could work on movies to watch with his wife and kids. Adam Sandler&apos;s character Donny Berger is a lovable sleazeball, exactly what you&apos;ve seen in the trailers. Andy Samberg is the straight man in the routine. This movie has some great casting of young talents (Eva Amurri, Leighton Meester) and veterans (James Caan, Tony Orlando). I hate pointless cameos, and this movie had a couple. Erin Andrews&apos;s 8 seconds of screen time were completely pointless. However, I loved every second of Ian Zeiring and Alan Thicke. If I&apos;d have never watched football, I would have completely believed that Rex Ryan was a professional actor. He&apos;s a natural, but I could have done without the wink-at-the-camera football references that pander at sports fans. I don&apos;t want to spoil the plot, but you can expect lots of sex jokes and surprising moments. Also, because Donny was an 80&apos;s kid who basically never grew up, this movie has lots of funny 80&apos;s references. But it never felt like rehashed material from the Wedding Singer. Bottom line: If you like crude sexual humor and you go into this movie with an open mind, you&apos;re going to have a great time.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. I thought Mr. Deeds was mediocre. 50 First Dates was very disappointing (about 2 jokes in that movie). I refused to watch Jack and Jill.",

      "reviewBody": "Stoker is a psychological thriller that you might not expect. It&apos;s not the usual type of the genre. The storytelling is in pure style and it features its terror in a completely twisted way. It&apos;s a weird cinematic experience that might stuck in your head for some time. It didn&apos;t offer much new to the plot but it creates a both melancholic and terrifying atmosphere to the picture which made it fascinating. What&apos;s more fascinating is the filmmaking understands the psychosis beneath it and it clearly shows them on screen. Stoker is quite peculiar but in a remarkably stunning way.\n\nThe story is just simple but it is told very differently. Thrillers usually slowly builds the tension of the plot until it gets to the point that everything what&apos;s happening is not right. Here, it already shows the oddness of their lives. The only thing it does now is to explore what&apos;s happening to the characters and what they are going to do. The plot isn&apos;t really that complex but it&apos;s all rather provocative. It embraces the strangeness that is manipulated from the two Stokers. It&apos;s not ought to be scary or anything. It&apos;s all about taking the ride on their horrifying acts. These scenes are, without a doubt, bizarre and somehow disturbing.\n\nThe film has a set of amazing talents. Mia Wasikowska has always been lovely and talented. She gives a sense of weirdness inside of her innocence which is perfect to the character. Nicole Kidman makes a great desperate mother. Matthew Goode adds some creepy mannerism to the psychotic Uncle Charlie. It&apos;s easy to get infatuated by his deceiving charms. The violence is a bit tamed for a Chan-wook Park film, but here, he aims more at the fortitude. He fills them with an impressively energetic style which helps executing its eerie. The gorgeous cinematography captures the melancholia of their world. Everything is just stunning.\n\nThe story isn&apos;t really that subtle or original but Stoker is a stylishly made film that will give you a quite different experience. Instead of jump scares or whatever tricks that typical thrillers use, the film rather tests the anxiety of the audience in these strange haunting exteriors. The film is not trying to be innovative but the reason why it&apos;s interesting is because of its intense use of filmmaking styles. It leaves the clichéd modern thriller plot points for a while and it simply tells the story by exploring these people&apos;s little twisted lives. Overall, it&apos;s visually captivating despite of the horror underneath the surfaces and that what makes the film so appealing.",

Her performance got an extra something along the year and I believe it will continue to grow like most wonderful true things. Helen Mirren is not an actress who &quot;dissappears&quot; behind a character , no, she is in total control and that&apos;s what makes her creation so moving. The illusion is fueled by her own conviction - the character&apos;s as well as the actress&apos;s. Last night I wondered, during the Queen and her Prime Minister&apos;s walk, how did the real Elizabeth II reacted to this portrait. I&apos;m sure she&apos;s seen it and I&apos;m sure that she must agree that nobody could have done it better or more fairly.",

Weisz and Hackman&apos;s performances are of Oscar quality, despite the fact that the movie is not up to their caliber of acting. The setting is a little out of the way, and the pacing is a little off with scenes that go way to fast but the film is ultimately save by the acting by all involved, most of which is credited to Weisz and Hackman.\n\n2 stars for Weisz and Hackman but don&apos;t expect anything close to the book."

      "name": "A young computer whizz kid accidentally taps into a top secret super-computer and nearly starts WW3",
      "reviewBody": "A rogue young man named David (Matthew Broderick) along with his best friend Jennifer (Ally Sheedy) hack into their high school&apos;s computer to change his grade and later on , find a back door into a military central computer in which reality is confused with game-playing, possibly starting World War III . As the United State&apos;s Department of Homeland Security is led to believe an American teen hacker playing a terrorist-attack simulator game online is a real terrorist out to destroy the U.S . The system is called the War Operation Plan Response, or WOPR for short, developed by brilliant but now deceased scientist Stephen Falken (John Wood), who programmed the system to learn continually through game simulations . At the end , a message : The only winning move is not to play.\n\nThis is an entertaining film of the 80s ; it was way ahead of its time and it stills grips the spectator . A popular flick in which a young computer whiz hooks into a game manufacturer&apos;s computer and accidentally starts WWII when he decides to play a selection titled ¨Global Thermonuclear Warfare¨ . The picture contains almost no violence , nor murders or any other sensationalistic content . Interesting as well as amusing screenplay by writers Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes who during their extensive research for the film, made friends with many &apos;hackers&apos; and security experts. They later wrote ¨Sneakers¨ another film featuring &apos;hackers&apos; and security experts. Likable starring couple , Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy , both of whom hold a great chemistry . Large support cast such as Barry Corbin , Dabney Coleman , Dennis Lipscomb and many of them uncredited as Michael Madsen , Eddie Deezen , James Tolkan , ArtLeFleur , William H. Macy , Maury Chaykin and John Spencer . Special mention to John Wood as Professor Stephen Falken ; main inspiration for this character was Cambridge Professor Stephen Hawking ; he was originally approached to appear in the movie, but he declined because he didn&apos;t want the producers exploiting his disability . Adequate musical score accompanying the action by Arthur B. Rubinstein and inventively photographed by classic cameraman William A Fraker . The film was part of a 1980s cycle of films about atomic bombs and nuclear warfare which had started in 1979 with ¨The China syndrome¨. The films included ¨Silkwood¨, ¨Testament¨, ¨Threads¨, ¨The day after¨ , ¨The Atomic Cafe¨, ¨Ground zero¨,¨Special Bulletin¨ , ¨Barefoot Gen¨, ¨Rules of Engagement¨, ¨Letters from a Dead Man¨ , ¨The chain reaction¨, among others . Followed by an inferior remake titled ¨ WarGames: The Dead Code (2008)¨ by Stuart Gillard with Matt Lanter as Will Farmer , Amanda Walsh as Annie D&apos;Mateo , Colm Feore as Joshua and Chuck Shamata as Bill Carter .\n\nThe motion picture was professionally directed by John Badham , though the original director was Martin Brest, and several of the scenes he shot are still in the movie , but he was fired as filmmaker a short while into production due to creative differences . Badham&apos;s breakthrough credit was the box office smash Fever Saturday night (1977) ; other hits on his resume include The Blue Thunder (1983), War games (1983), and Shortcircuit (1986). He&apos;s a nice director who achieved his greatest success in the 80s and 90s . He directed several hits (Drop zone , Nick of time , Skateout ,Point of No Return , Bird on a wire) , though today making TV movies (Jack Bull , Floating away) and television episodes (Crossing Jordan, Psych, Las Vegas, Standoff , Heroes).",

The humor is definitely not for everyone, with plenty of toilet humor, absurdities, and the kind of stuff we probably remember best from Monty Python, Madrilen, and the like. It&apos;s amusing that they managed to get some very well-known names involved in the joke.\n\nIt&apos;s not a masterpiece, absolutely not, but there are laughs along the way, small smiles, and it&apos;s actually quite funny without being super amazing, yet also miles away from &quot;the world&apos;s worst movie.&quot; I can certainly name so-called A-movies from both 2024 and 2023 that are significantly worse.",

      "name": "The question that kept on running through my mind was not who the wolf was, but rather who cares who the wolf was?",
      "reviewBody": "The plot of Catherine Hardwicke&apos;s &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot; revolves around a series of massacres and a pressing question. The said massacres being caused by a werewolf and the said question being who the wolf is. But as I watched it, the question that kept on running through my mind was not who the wolf was, but rather who cares who the wolf was? This is a very flabby-footed, self-delusional mess of a movie that succeeds in making even the great Gary Oldman look as unnatural in his performance as Steven Seagal.\n\n&quot;Red Riding Hood&quot; suffers from a poorly-constructed screenplay, one that seems was written within a handful of days and not given a single second of revision. The writer, David Johnson, was a production assistant on Frank Darabont&apos;s masterpiece &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; but his talents seem to be more focused on polishing up a movie rather than spinning up a story. The plot of &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot; is contrived, flat, and lacking any zest. In fact, even though the denouement has great potential to be a real shocker and (I&apos;ll be honest) caught me by surprise, it was handled and executed so sloppily and the writing that summarizes it all up was so flimsy and manipulative, that it registered no impact on me whatsoever.\n\nThere are no characters worth caring about and next to nothing in terms of acting. The titular character is played by an up-and-coming starlet by the name of Amanda Seyfried, although if all of her performances are as uncharismatic and dull as this one, I cannot imagine why. In this performance, at least, she did not strike me as being a natural actress. Then again, she has nothing to work with in Mr. Johnson&apos;s screenplay. She also has two romantic interests, one played by Max Irons and the other by a wooden-faced Shiloh Fernandez. They are just as boring as their characters. They have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever with Miss Seyfried; I never felt any passion. Even Gary Oldman, so good so many times before, is awful here, hamming up and chewing apart every scene that he is in. His introductory moment, where he explains his experiences with werewolves, is handled by him in a way that is so over-the-top, almost like a really bad vaudeville performance. It&apos;s hard to believe that this is the same actor from &quot;The Dark Knight,&quot; &quot;The Book of Eli,&quot; and the Harry Potter movies.\n\nIf there is one good performance at all it is by Julie Christie, who is just as magnetic and wonderful as she was when she graced the screen in David Lean&apos;s &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; forty-six years ago. She has a powerful star presence and quality that allows her to overcome even the trashy dialogue and nothingness that she was supplied.\n\nAnother strike against the movie is the apparent lack of experience by its director, Catherine Hardwicke. She was a production designer before this movie (she designed the wonderful town reconstruction for &quot;Tombstone&quot; in 1993) but her skills with a motion picture camera are next to nothing. She doesn&apos;t seem to even know the basics about misc en scene and how to structure a sequence. Not even enough to know that a moment where Mr. Oldman gives a last minute warning to a stubborn old villager about the impending threat of the werewolf that she should have had a reverse angle to show the villager&apos;s reaction; instead she chooses to stick to the back of his head. There is no steady flow of images here, with too many medium and long shots and close-ups so claustrophobic that they enter the territory of being loony. One scene that was directed particularly badly was a laughable love moment between Miss Seyfriend and Mr. Fernandez. There is a problem with a romantic moment where the sight of two people making love is neither heart-warming, nor, obviously, erotic.\n\nBut Miss Hardwicke did coordinate well with her production designer, for the sets are quite good. And the special effects are decent enough in and of themselves. The werewolf, computer-generated of course, are much better than the cartoony wolves I saw in &quot;Season of the Witch&quot; earlier this year. It&apos;s only a shame that that wolf was not on-screen more.\n\n&quot;Red Riding Hood&quot; has a feel of so many medieval melodramas of recent years: half-hearted and flimsy. It is also crippled by that haunting feeling that even the people who made the movie would not even want to see it. It feels like an assignment done by people hopelessly unhappy in their work, who just wanted to get through the dailies so they could go home and relax before getting up to do the same thing again the next day.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; is the 1990 sequel to the 1984 box office hit &quot;Gremlins&quot; which is one of my all-time favorite movies. The sequel is not as good as the original, but its not bad either. Here the filmakers did something different. They tried to make this one more of a comedy than the original. The first film was funny but also scary. &quot;Gremlins 2&quot; plays more like a Mel Brooks-type movie with some of the jokes that are in it. But its hardly scary. Plus, it got a little tiresome to watch the gremlins do some of the exact same things that they did the first time around like drinking, smoking, etc. Nevertheless, this is for the most part an entertaining movie that I&apos;d wish had done better at the box office. I think if they had made this three years after the original instead of six years, it would have done better. In between the two &quot;Gremlins&quot; flicks there were all those ripoffs (&quot;Critters&quot;, &quot;Ghoulies&quot; and their sequels) and by 1990 moviegoers became tired of it all. But the two &quot;Gremlins&quot; movies are much better than the &quot;Critters&quot; and &quot;Ghoulies&quot; movies. A good job by director Joe Dante.\n\n*** (out of four)",

      "reviewBody": "This was a &apos;steady&apos; flicknot as fun as Jack Black&apos;s other films but definitely better than Nacho Libre. Personally, this musical comedy is so much easier to digest than other operatic Broadway drivel, especially if you are a fan of Tenacious D (their song &quot;Wonderboy&quot; is a real hoot!).\n\nBlack and Kyle Gass make up the band that is Tenacious D. Listen to their song &quot;Tribute&quot; to better appreciate the movie (the video&apos;s hilarious, too!). The movie is a spin-off of the song, which tells the story of how Tenacious D was formed to become the world&apos;s greatest band by defeating Satan himself (played by the Foo Fighters&apos; Dave Grohl). Watch out for other cameos by Ben Stiller (also the executive producer), John C. Reilly and many more.\n\nThe plot is thin and ridiculous but you continue to watch it anyway just because it can be irreverently fun (living out the essence of rock). Also, because rooting for the underdogs that Black and Gass areold, balding, tubby rockstar-wannabesis such a classic crowd-pleasing formula. Watch it if you like rock, don&apos;t take things so seriously, and just want to zone out for some self-indulgent me-time. :o)",

However, I watched the remake open minded and was pleased with a lot of new elements to the movie. There are a few nice plot twists and I really liked the main leads especially Colin Farrell and Imogen Poots. I liked that it was a bit more modern and that the setting took place in Las Vegas. It set up nicely the fact that Peter Vincent&apos;s magic show was one of the famous Vegas highlights. The movie has a few flaws though one being a poor job on character development for the three friends, which I thought they could have extended a few scenes on in the beginning. Also, it was a huge bummer seeing the fake computer generated vampire effects. That was a huge turnoff that made me say &quot;UGH!&quot; out loud a few times. The Fright Night remake (6/10) is not total rubbish but it&apos;s really nothing to seek out.",

      "name": "A genre classic - oft copied, never matched",
      "reviewBody": "Although this film receives a lot of credit for reinvigorating the action/buddy genre movie, the praise is too often misdirected.  For instance, whilst Bruce Willis gives a solid performance as low-life private eye Joe Hallenbeck, we have seen the act a dozen times.  There are remnants of Die Hard&apos;s John McClane in every knowing smirk and pained cigarette inhalation.  Equally, Tony Scott&apos;s direction is still based on an obsession with placing bright lights behind the actors and turning up the volume of car chases and gunshots.  Jimmy Dix, the faded football hero, is given a suitably comic persona by Damon Wayons and the action sequences are as good as you will find elsewhere in Hollywood.  However, these are not the attractions of the film for me.\n\nYou might think, from what is written above, that I disliked the film but you would be mistaken to think that as I believe it to be an absolute classic of its kind.  I truly think The Last Boy Scout should be used as a teaching tool at film schools the world over.  In spite of its glaring limitations it is a movie that has everything!  The opening scene is a modern movie classic - up there with those of Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Goodfellas.  If there is a film-goer alive whose mouth didn&apos;t gape in wonderous amusement at the climax to the opening scene then I am amazed. The plot, as far fetched as it is, provides a perfect vehicle for the key elements that go towards making this the gem of a movie that it is.\n\nFirst in the list of key elements is the wonderfully funny dialogue. Shane Black&apos;s hallmark of snappy one-liners is all over the sizzling repartee between the two heroes.  Even Hallenbeck&apos;s daughter gets a couple of laugh-out-loud lines.  Secondly, the story benefits from the ideal combination of: sport, gambling, violence, comedy, the odd topless dancer, important values of family and friendship, revenge and honour.  Take out the topless dancer and they pretty much all feature in The Godfather!\n\nThe third crucial component for the success of The Last Boy Scout is the perfect casting of the bad guys.  Milo, played to chilling perfection by Taylor Negron, is a bad guy with a difference.  He isn&apos;t just a mindless hard man.  His brilliantly annoying habit of calling people by their elongated names is a superb touch (Joe becomes Joseph, Jimmy becomes James and so on), as are his attempts at civility when trying to &quot;do a formal introduction&quot; with the kidnapped Hallenbeck.  Other bad guys are fleshed out and distinguished by quirky traits or funny lines.  They are not merely there to make the good guys look good.\n\nOverall, this film is not a piece of celluloid art.  It is, however, a perfect example of popcorn-friendly entertainment.  It is the sort of movie you imagine the makers would like to see as movie-goers themselves. Without being utterly contemptible or mindlessly low-brow it entertains.  An ideal Saturday night movie to watch with a group of friends.",

Because, for example, we see Bond dressed like a clown or keeping a plaster; there&apos;s an exotic and romantic atmosphere -which reminds us of some adventure books (like Emilio Salgari&apos;s &quot;Sandokan&quot; and &quot;The count of Monte-Cristo&quot;...) Here 007 has to travel between India and Germany for stopping a catastrophic plan of Soviet General Orlov and Afghan prince Khamal Khan.\n\nWith a little more parody than in the previous film &quot;For your eyes only&quot;, &quot;Octopussy&quot; continues in the line of more down to earth Bond adventures.\n\nRoger Moore&apos;s performance is good as usual, the cast is also remarkable -Louis Jourdan is one of the French actors who built a good Hollywood career, starring in films like Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;The Paradine case&quot; and Vincente Minnelli&apos;s &quot;Gigi&quot;. He&apos;s Kamal Khan, a very charming and sophisticated villain -he&apos;s the criminal equivalent of Bond. Jourdan brings a special touch of glamour -you see he&apos;s an actor of the golden years of Hollywood!\n\nMaud Adams is the only actress who played twice a Bond girl -she was Andrea in &quot;The man with the golden gun&quot;.\n\nSteven Berkoff is an established English actor, mainly for theater, but he played also in Stanley Kubrick&apos;s &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;.\n\nKabir Bedi is an Indian actor very popular in the second half of the Seventies -he was &quot;Sandokan&quot; in a famous TV film made by RAI, Italian public TV.\n\nJohn Glen directs the film with a lot of fun and assures a great show. The film doesn&apos;t disappoint.\n\n&quot;Octopussy&quot; is the last great Roger Moore movie as Bond, and maybe the last BIG Bond of the series as well -because it&apos;s original, lavish, acrobatic, romantic and pompous. \n\n8,5/10"

Provide a little more background and bring it up to today&apos;s technological specs. \n\nWhile I think it tried too hard and perhaps did try to take itself a bit too seriously, if you come in with an open mind about it, you&apos;ll be somewhat surprised and may find that you enjoy it. I found that the camera angles and cinematography was okay, but it had moments where it felt very cheesy. \n\nIf they could have picked up a really good director for action / sci-first (eg Whedon), we could have had a really excellent and fun movie. Alas, it falls slightly short of good. If you&apos;re looking for a bit of a campy movie with some good cheese factor, check it out. Otherwise, perhaps pass this one up.",

Oh and I actually thought they did pretty good tying up the ending. A lot of people complain the last part ruined the film or wasn&apos;t good, but it surprised me as I thought it would be much worse. I say it&apos;s worth checking out if you haven&apos;t. It wasn&apos;t groundbreaking or anything but managed to keep me focused for a few hours. I give it a 6. I liked it better than Aja&apos;s High Tension. Now to me that was a bad ending.",

For some reason it&apos;s panned over other far worse ones he&apos;s churned out of the gumball machine (ever re-watch Billy Madison? What the hell were we/they thinking back then?), but when you part the curtains of Sandler Stigma and really just look at what the movie is in itself, it&apos;s a hoot. What other film can boast Rodney Dangerfield playing Harvey Keitel&apos;s dad in heell? That&apos;s right, Keitel is the red beast himself, coming down off a ten thousand year unholy monarchy, with no plans to retire. This infuriates his two wicked sons, played by Tiny Lister (must have been a different devil-mom) and a slick Rhys Ifans. They depart the inferno and set up their own devilish franchise up in New York City, raising all kinds of hell, the most amusing of which is lowering the drinking age to ten (where were these guys when I was that age?) and forcing Regis Philbin to say naughty things on live primetime. Their younger, slightly retarded brother Nicky (Sandler) must pursue them on their haunts and trap them in a magic flask before it&apos;s too late. Dumb concept, right? Sure it is, but try and tell me it&apos;s not hilarious m, especially with the amount of inane visual gags and trippy production design these folks have dreamed up. Between Hitler dressed as a slutty maid getting a pineapple repeatedly rammed up his rectum to a giant gorilla massaging mammaries that have sprouted on a dude&apos;s head like fleshy succulent pigtails, there&apos;s no shortage of wtf moments. Sander picks an odd character mask as usual, sporting a metal-head swoosh of a haircut and lisping his way through his lines sounding like he had a stroke from watching Billy Madison dailies one too many times. Patricia Arquette is in it, as a sweet, shy girl he meets topside and the closest thing to a sane person you&apos;ll find in this madhouse. Cameos abound, from usual Sandler cronies like Jon Lovitz, Rob Schneider, Kevin Nealon, Dana Carvey, Peter Dante and Allen Covert, to randoms like Michael McKean, Clint Howard, Laura Harring, Henry Winkler, Ozzy Osborne, Reese Witherspoon as Nicky&apos;s angelic mom and Quentin Tarantino as a blind preacher. I don&apos;t really know what else to say about the thing, because its it&apos;s own thing and you either rock out with it, or you don&apos;t. Visually it&apos;s never boring, the script was conceived in the toilet and jumped straight to the gutter, the performances are all garishly obnoxious and the overall tone is that of an sixth grade birthday party gone rogue.",

Most reviews were negative, but I went to see it out of pure boredom. I didn&apos;t expect much and having read all the negative reviews I watched it with my critics glasses on.\n\nI actually enjoyed this movie. Never have I given a movie 8/10 before. Why did I do it now? Performances. I reckon the people who went out to see this movie expected blood, guts and fecal matter flying all over the place. Instead they found hardcore actors doing what they do best. Even lesser known actors were up there doing it with the masters of the industry. Paul Bettany is one of the most underrated actors of our time. When has he ever given anything but a solid performance? Dennis Quaid? His prettiness might be a thing of the past, but as a performer he grows with every movie he makes. The same goes for the whole cast. They all acted like superstars.\n\nYou won&apos;t like this movie if you&apos;re into mindless B-grade BS. If, however, you like movies because the actors telling the story makes a fantasy feel so real you actually feel you&apos;re gonna break the armrests off your chair you should do yourself a favor and see this movie.\n\nOn a final note. Being a Christian myself I did not find this movie offensive at all.",

It&apos;s difficult to imagine Hackman &apos;not&apos; being in the service because he does it so &apos;friggin&apos; well.\n\nThe movie is suspenseful and the supporting cast is simply awesome!

      "reviewBody": "Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again fails to bring anything new to the table. It is made purely based on the success of the first film. Hollywood tend to do that a lot. When a film becomes successful, they make a 2nd film out of it, which lacks pretty much everything. First of all, if you want to go to see this film because Meryl Streep is in, don&apos;t bother, because she has a scene of 5 minutes in the end. She just sings two songs and that&apos;s pretty much it. She is in the front row of the film poster, she is the main image of the final trailer, because production company uses her image to attract audience. These kinds of tricks can be seen a lot, while advertising substandard quality films. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again has one purpose, and that is to make more money by using the fame of the first film. I failed to understand why they even bothered making a sequel when everything was wrapped beautifully in the first film. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is written and directed by Ol Parker. I said written, but I really don&apos;t know what he has exactly written, because in the means of story there is nothing.\n\nThe people in this film are like from a different planet. They live in a parallel universe or something. There is no one ugly in the film. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is all about beautiful people, their artificially created problems, fake tears, sadness and meaningless joy. They are all very successful, their secret bonds don&apos;t have a resource. We don&apos;t know why those characters love each other so much, but they do. The film takes place five years after the previous events. Donna is dead. Sophie (Amada Seyfried) takes over the hotel and builds it from zero. While they prepare for the grand opening, we go back to 1979, where everything starts for Donna. She is claimed to be a free soul and an independent woman, but someone must tell the writer of this character that having one night stands with handsome men on your way to Greek Island is not independence. Young Donna (Lily James) is presented to be a very different girl, but when you watch her behaviors, she is pretty much superficial. She falls in love with a man, gets depressed after he leaves, and in the very same day, she has sex with a different guy because she is very sad. Sophie and her problems regarding the hotel in the present day are told in parallel with Donna&apos;s youth and her story, how she met Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill, (Stellan Skargard) how she moved to the island of Kalokairi and how she built the hotel.\n\nYoung Donna&apos;s friends Tanya and Rosie, as well as her lovers, Harry, Bill and Sam, are played by actors and actresses who have nothing to do with the actual characters. They all look very different. The story takes place in a Greek island but the film was shot in Croatia and Shepperton Studios in Surrey England. Set up of the sequel is pretty much similar with the first film. There is a song for every situation. The story was created based on the situations in those songs, and there is a song for every character, problem and situation. That&apos;s the reason why I said there is no story. It is time for a sad song, a sad situation is created. It is time for a joyful song, and something happy happens. There are very few scenes that can be compared with real life situations. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is a complete waste of money and time. I had a good taste in my mouth after the first film, but now that is all gone thanks to this useless film that was made just because of financial matters.\n\nThe strongest point of the film is its songs. It is satisfying in the means of music. You get to hear songs mostly from ABBA, as usual, and Arrival. After all, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is also a musical, but even so, some songs are really bad for my taste. When I Kissed the Teacher from Arrival is one, for an example. Just to be able to sing this song, they created a graduation scene. This is what I meant when I said, circumstances are created based on the songs in the film. I have never seen such a thing in my life. I haven&apos;t seen an acting performance worth mentioning. This film was released on July 16, 2018 in Hammersmith Apollo and on July 20, 2018 in the United Kingdom and United States. It has 114 minutes of runtime and made with a budget of $75 Million. With a forced story and meaningless characters, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is a film that I will never watch again. Having actors and actresses in the film just because they look beautiful shouldn&apos;t be a criteria while choosing your characters. This sequel is so hopeless that even the presence of Andy Garcia and Cher couldn&apos;t save it.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is nothing really special, and it telegraphs what is going to happen from miles away. The story is about four teen girls in a Catholic high school who are outcasts for different reasons - one lives in poverty with a semi-abusive stepfather, another has a scarred arm and back, another is the victim of boiler plate racism, and the fourth - well, I could never really figure out her problem other than she was the new girl in school.\n\nThey are all beautiful, but all are bullied by girls and gals who - IMHO - weren&apos;t as good looking as they were. So they dabble in witchcraft to get out of their bad situations. Only two actually wish bad things to happen to their tormentors. The other two just want their bad circumstances to be gone, and in one situation that results in unexpected and unwished for death. But, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and soon the leader of our gang of four is drunk with power.\n\nAm I a bad person because I liked seeing the cool guy make a fool of himself in front of his friends over the girl he trash talked? Well, so be it. The film is mainly good for its special effects and for a look back at the teen stars of the 90s. Fairuza Balk is very good at playing a very bad girl. She has the exotic yet scary facial features for the role, but she couldn&apos;t have done anything with it without talent.",

I&apos;m not sure what the non-director&apos;s cut was, because the version I saw was the director&apos;s cut, but it was absolutely fantastic. Not once did I think that the nearly four hour run time was too long because the story was so compelling, the direction brilliant and the acting engaging.  I find it hard to believe that it took me this long to see this film, and I also find it hard to believe it is not in the IMDB Top 250.  Its Best Picture and Director honors were well-deserved, and the Oscar-winning score is amazing.  I&apos;ll admit that I was left hanging a bit in regard to the Emperor&apos;s wife, but that is the only thing that I can remotely find slightly lacking in this film.  An outstanding film, The Last Emperor is entertaining, informative and important.\n\n--Shelly",

Of course, Candy and his half-hang-dog, half- know-it-all, and half know-nothing (yes, that&apos;s too many halves) together carry the film, but the others hit their marks as well -- kids, teens, and adults as well. There are some classic moments - I think about Buck&apos;s friend down at the crime lab who can analyze a toothbrush to make sure the kids brushed their teeth every time my kids claim they&apos;ve brushed their teeth when I know they didn&apos;t spend enough time in there.

      "reviewBody": "The heroine ofJoachim Trier&apos;s latest film &apos;The Worst Person in the World&apos; (2021) is about 30 years old, but she still hasn&apos;t managed to find a profession that would give full meaning to her life, or the man she would like to be with and spend the rest of her life, or what could make her happy. It is, if you wish, the film of her searches and the failure of these searches in a hurried and individualistic world. This contemporary Norwegian counter-heroine is one of the most complex and interesting female characters I have seen on screen in recent years. Renate Reinsve&apos;s formidable performance brought her a well-deserved award for female performance at the Cannes Film Festival. This is one of the important reasons, but not the only one for which this film is worth seeing.\n\nJulie (Renate Reinsve) is an intelligent and intellectually gifted young woman. She starts studying medicine and then gives up, starts studying psychology and abandons this as well, decides to become a photographer and works in parallel and as a bookseller at a bookstore. Her parents are divorced, she is closer to her mother (who is worried about her daughter&apos;s un-decisions) while her distant and indifferent father is a negative model that probably makes her wary of relationships with men. And yet she falls in love, not with one man but with two: with a comics book writer and cartoonist about 14 years her senior who wants a child and with a seller at a pastry shop who wants to have fun and maybe to get rid of his previous girlfriend who is more interested by ecology and vegetarianism. Time passes, life advances, but it is not clear in which direction.\n\nI guess that one of &apos;Joachim Trier&apos;s sources of inspiration are Woody Allen&apos;s older and newer films. The organization of the story in 12 chapters plus a prologue and an epilogue, the well-matched use in this case of off-screen voice, the relationship between lovers separated by age gap, the presence of parents in the lives of mature people, all these they reminded Allen. Even the almost exclusively urban setting seems inspired by his films, with a local touch, of course. If you haven&apos;t visited Oslo (like me) by the time you finish watching this movie you will feel the desire to visit this city, which looks colorful, sophisticated, and ... warm (most of the story seems to take place in the summer). The location in time is clear, thanks to the pandemic masks that the characters wear in the epilogue. Just count a few years back. There are at least two chapters in the film with original cinematography that fits well into the logic of the story - the imaginary or real encounter between lovers looking for and finding each other with the rest of the world frozen around and the sequence of the &apos;experimentation&apos; with hallucinogenic mushrooms. &apos;The Worst Person in the World&apos; is the story of an imperfect woman with an imperfect life, as are the lives of most of us, a woman who is certainly not the worst person in the world, and the film about her is made interestingly and well acted. Recommended viewing.",

The story did little in introducing you to all the character, but after you meet everyone, they&apos;re all let lose and scattered in awesome violence. Once you start to piece everything together, it starts to become a theme of survival. Unlike other slasher/action film that leads the character wandering helplessly through the scene and somehow end up surviving, You&apos;re Next takes you on a thrill ride where you&apos;re always on the edge of your seat rooting at every brilliant attempt of their survival. The dialogues are simple and humorous in many of the scenes, but you&apos;ll find yourself watching this only to wonder what&apos;ll happen at the end.",

      "reviewBody": "Whenever there is a new adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel is released, there&apos;s always a mass amount of haters and so be it because some of them are extremely cheesy and bad, however I think that the hate towards The Lucky One is unwarranted, I personally thought it was a very enjoyable romantic drama. The Lucky One is quite different to other Sparks movies, I found the storyline to be a lot more serious and mature than normal, and the story being told from the male perspective is also a nice change.\n\nThe acting from Zac Efron is top form, as he gets older his roles get better and his acting improves with each movie, Taylor Schilling is also nice, if not being a little too old for Efron, but she brings some niceness to the character, and Blythe Danner is a bit of a scene stealer in her small role.\n\nYes parts of this film are a little cliché, particularly towards the end, but it&apos;s no biggie, the lack of chemistry between the two leads is a bit annoying at first but soon it changes and gets better, even though Taylor Schilling is nice in the role I do think that she is miscast, I think Abbie Cornish may have suited the role a little more. But even still the few flaws that this movie does have doesn&apos;t distract from the overall niceness of the film.\n\nZefron is all man now and he is definitely an actor to watch. Fans of the book will love it, Zac fans will love it too, generally a nice romance to enjoy with friends.",

      "reviewBody": "OK, so I have to admit: I can&apos;t help but love Sly Stallone. The guy just keeps coming back succesfully, against all odds. Who would have thought that he could pull off another Rambo flick at age 73? Well, I&apos;m glad he did, because besides Liam Neeson, Denzel Washington and Mel Gibson, who are we gonna turn to for some old school, old-man-on-a-revenge-spree flick?\n\nI was a big fan of First Blood, but didn&apos;t care so much for the second (too cartoonish) and third (too friggin&apos; awful) installments. The fourth however, was just amazing. A slow build up, a suspenseful breakout and then cathartic violence. That last action sequence, where Rambo goes totally berserk and makes minced meat out of a whole army, I mean, come on, that was awesome.\n\nThe fifth Rambo is a little different in that it is more of a generic revenge flick in its setup. But only in its setup though. As soon as Rambo starts maiming and killing, this movie goes so far over the top you can&apos;t help but cheer him on. This is one bloody movie. Last blood it may be, but it is many a full bucket of it.\n\nI also like how Rambo is more vulnarable in this flick. Stallone gets to use more of his acting chops in this one.\n\nI know it&apos;s a lot to ask, and maybe I shouldn&apos;t even hope for it, but damn it, I sure would like another one of these.",

Brendan Fraser struts his acting talent in this film quite nicely, playing virtually 5 or 6 characters throughout the film.  Brendan really is a talented actor and should get some notice for his role in this film.  Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein, and Toby Huss also deserve a great deal of notice for their work in this film, all three of them play various types of characters in the film and do it quite nicely.  Elizabeth Hurley and her ever-changing wardrobe should be reason enough for any guy to watch this film.  She looks nothing short of fantastic in every scene.  Frances O&apos;Connor was a nice choice for the part of Alison / Nicole (also playing more than one role very nicely).\n\nAll in all, this is a fun, cute movie with some really good comedy.  I would recommend this film to anyone that likes those types of film, or is just a fan of one of the actors or director Harold Ramis.  I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,\n\n-Chris",

      "name": "PTA Does Pynchon: Meandering Through Inherent Vice",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;I never remember the plots of movies. I remember how they make me feel.&quot;\n\n\n* Paul Thomas Anderson, 10/5/2014, &quot;On Cinema Masterclass&quot;, New York Film Festival\n\n\nIt&apos;s nearly impossible to talk about Inherent Vice, PTA&apos;s new stoner noir, without providing some context.\n\nIt&apos;s crucial to know, for example, that the film is an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon&apos;s 2009 novel. It&apos;s also crucial to understand the novel&apos;s subject matter and setting: a sprawling conspiracy, which may or may not exist, that involves a real estate mogul, hippies, the LAPD, and a heroin cartel named the Golden Fang, all against the backdrop of Southern California in 1970, the year after the Manson Family Massacre. Some familiarity with Pynchon&apos;s literary output–both his prose style and unique narrative structure–is helpful as well, almost required. Finally, to really grasp Inherent Vice, it&apos;d be useful to know PTA&apos;s relationship with plot, which can best be understood by reading the quote above and thinking about the trajectory of his career (a career marked by films that have become more and more &quot;plotless&quot;).\n\nSo, when we put all of this together, what do we get? To a large degree, we get exactly what we should have expected: a filmmaker creating a nearly-flawless adaptation of a nearly-impossible-to-adapt author. Wacky humor, a never ending stream of new characters (some of whom are neither introduced nor explained thoroughly), dialogue that sometimes feels like it&apos;s written in code, abrupt jumps between characters and scenes, unapologetically deep cultural references, long and wordy voice-overs, seemingly random occurrences that don&apos;t tie together, and a continual sense of paranoia that grows from the viewer (or reader&apos;s) inability to decipher what&apos;s real and what&apos;s imagined. Make no mistake, at the center of Inherent Vice is PTA&apos;s unyielding dedication to Pynchon&apos;s vision and his desire to put that vision, in full, on screen.\n\nBut, PTA&apos;s decision to remain so faithful to Pynchon&apos;s imagination comes with its faults. The only character we really feel invested in is Doc, the stoner, private eye protagonist played by Joaquin Phoenix (Phoenix is in almost every scene and deserves another Oscar nomination for his fantastic work). The other characters end up feeling peripheral, almost like they exist only to drive forward the narrative of Doc&apos;s detective search rather than exist as individual characters we should care about. Even Doc&apos;s love interest, Sashta, who shows up at Doc&apos;s house in the first scene and asks for a favor that sets in motion the goose chase at the heart of the film, is difficult to care about. Her presence in the film, while strong in certain moments, doesn&apos;t seem to stick because it&apos;s so ephemeral, dreamy, and enigmatic.\n\nThis is a flaw sometimes overlooked in novels (see DeLillo or Foster Wallace in addition to Pynchon), but it often distances viewers when done in films. More importantly, it&apos;s a criticism totally inapplicable to PTA&apos;s previous films. Boogie Nights and Magnolia also centered around ensemble casts, but in those films the viewer deeply cared about each and every character, whether it was Quiz Kid Donnie or pornographer-turned-speaker- salesmen Buck. The difference: PTA creating his own characters from scratch versus PTA capturing another artist&apos;s vision in uncompromising fashion.\n\nIt&apos;s also important to remember that many of Inherent Vice&apos;s viewers haven&apos;t read the book. I can&apos;t imagine how wild of a ride Inherent Vice will be for them. It&apos;ll certainly be a confusing experience, somewhere between trippy and surreal, almost Lynchian in its opaqueness and lack of narrative continuity. Perhaps it can best be summed up by the words of a girl who sat behind me at PTA&apos;s &quot;On Cinema&quot; talk at the New York Film Festival the day after Inherent Vice&apos;s world premiere: &quot;It was good, but don&apos;t ask me to tell you what happened.&quot; This confusion and general inaccessibility will turn people off, much like The Master left some people enamored and others disappointed and unfulfilled.\n\nAnother important piece of context surrounding Inherent Vice, as always with highly anticipated films, is the prism of expectation. Many people predicted (and, I think, hoped) that Inherent Vice would be a return to form for PTA, a Boogie Nights Redux of some sort. They anticipated that the similarities between the films–1970&apos;s content, drugs, an ensemble cast–would unlock a time machine that catapulted us back to the earlier stages of PTA&apos;s career. Others, myself included, thought the film would split the difference between The Big Lebowski and L.A. Confidential, perfectly balancing the stoner laughs with tense and mystery-driven drama. These expectations were only furthered by Warner Brothers&apos; decision to release a late and deceptively cut trailer, which I can only assume was a marketing decision made in reaction to The Master losing money at the box office.\n\nBut, the simple reality of PTA&apos;s films is that they are so good and so unique precisely because they can&apos;t be predicted. In that sense, Inherent Vice is no different. It&apos;s a ludicrously ambitious film crafted by a director who appears more interested in challenging himself as a filmmaker than anything else. It&apos;s a film that&apos;s long on dialogue but short on plot (shortest on plot of all PTA&apos;s films, which may shock some people, especially those who weren&apos;t fond of The Master). It&apos;s a film that, for two and a half hours, takes its viewer on a journey, leisurely meandering through a certain time and place, all while fluctuating in tone from romantic to paranoid to stoned. While Inherent Vice is neither what some thought it would be nor what many wanted it to be, it&apos;s exactly what it is, and more importantly, perhaps it&apos;s exactly what it had to be.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Moana 2&quot; has to be one of the most unexpected sequels in recent memory. It only came to my attention earlier this year when Disney announced they retooled a TV show that continues the original film&apos;s story into a theatrically released sequel. That&apos;s not even mentioning that they&apos;re releasing a live-action remake in 2026. The original &quot;Moana&quot; is an incredible film with spectacular voice acting from Auli&apos;i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson as Moana and Maui, dazzling animation, iconic songs in &quot;How Far I&apos;ll Go&quot; and &quot;You&apos;re Welcome,&quot; a legendary side-character in Schaffrillas...I mean Tamatoa and an engaging narrative. I was curious to see how a sequel would work, and after seeing it, I realized one hard truth: I&apos;m not the target audience.\n\nFor the positives, the voice acting is still remarkable, with Cravalho and Johnson again delivering energetic performances. Even though the story is not the strongest, which we&apos;ll get to, their work manages to get me somewhat invested.\n\nOf course, the animation is phenomenal. Disney films have always been known for their terrific animation, so it goes without saying that &quot;Moana 2&quot; is no different.\n\nWhile this film does not have as many memorable songs as the first, &quot;Can I Get A Chee Hoo?&quot; is hands down the standout. The song doesn&apos;t reach the heights of the powerful &quot;How Far I&apos;ll Go.&quot; I don&apos;t think it will become as well-known as that song, but I enjoyed it.\n\nFor the remaining positives, three solid jokes landed here, its mid-credit scene was delightful, and the film is not that long. Sadly, negatives prevail and weigh down the experience - for me, at least.\n\nAlthough the runtime was short, I was bored even more than &quot;Gladiator II.&quot; Many factors I&apos;ll mention possibly led to me thinking the movie was tedious, but its pacing left me dissatisfied.\n\nI also felt the villain fell flat, not as much as The Rock&apos;s other release this month, &quot;Red One.&quot; I won&apos;t reveal who it is to avoid spoilers, but I didn&apos;t feel the threat from the film&apos;s antagonist.\n\nSo I don&apos;t over-critique it, I&apos;ll bring up one more point: I felt the narrative was weak. The setup of Moana going on an adventure to unite the islands seems simple at first, but the overall handling of that story comes across as convoluted. Said convolution leaves me with no investment in potentially emotional moments.\n\nOverall, &quot;Moana 2&quot; didn&apos;t work for me. I don&apos;t think it was unnecessary, but it didn&apos;t entirely justify its existence. It&apos;s simple and inoffensive yet oddly forgettable, so it&apos;s a fine enough trip to the movies. However, I&apos;m not recommending this in favor of &quot;Wicked&quot; for the Thanksgiving holiday season.\n\nTechnically, outside of issues with the story, the animation remains stunning, the voice acting is stellar, and the music is well-done yet average from my perspective, so the technical score is an 8/10.\n\nFor the enjoyment score, it is a standard sequel that has enjoyment but a standard sequel that is undeniably weaker than its counterpart. For me, the enjoyment score is a 5/10. Again, it is okay and will leave you interested to an extent, but I&apos;d recommend waiting until Disney+."

People like me, who were born 10-15 years after the war ended, knew it all along first hand from the stories told by parents and grandparents actually living through those times and events. My own mother at the age of seven was thrown by German soldiers into a barn that got lit, her front teeth were knocked out by the butt of a German soldier&apos;s rifle and she, along with tenth of other village kids, was saved by my grand-mother and other villagers only because some partisans had chosen to attack and deliberate the village that day. What most of Western viewers find horrifying, shocking and disturbing is nothing but the truth being accurately depicted by some later movie makers. This movie is pretty much like a documentary that could actually be shot with the help of some sort of a &quot;time machine&quot; in case there was one in 1985 when the movie got filmed.",

Other reviews I had read led me to believe that this was a cookie cutter, run of the mill, made for tv-esque amnesia story. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThe main plot of most amnesia types is trying to find out who they are and why someone erased their memory. With Paycheck, however, our protagonist already knows why his memory was erased, and since it&apos;s only been three years, he of course knows who he is.\n\nThe plot device is that at the end of this little memory wipe he&apos;s supposed to be 92 million dollars plus richer. Imagine his surprise when he finds out he&apos;s forfeit the money, and instead mailed himself some apparently worthless junk. Oh, and the company that hired him is trying to kill him.\n\nThis is what a Sci Fi movie should be, relying on an interesting premise, with future predictions based on current technology. Sci Fi is not space with explosions every five minutes.\n\nAlthough there are a few minor plot holes, I found the movie very engaging, and thought the acting was competent, to say the least. Those who enjoyed Minority Report might also like Paycheck. It&apos;s worth a look.\n\nbck",

      "reviewBody": "The original film in this franchise had a great premise but failed to do anything with the concept and I wasn&apos;t expecting anything with the sequel but was stunned by how much the production team developed the idea , so much so that I was genuinely excited to seeing the next film in the series which is a rare occurrence for me to get excited about upcoming film . As the trailers were released earlier in the year I did feel my excitement being negated and felt we&apos;d be getting more of the same from a concept that with hindsight might not have much in the way of legs . Yeah the promos did feature some very topical satire about a female Senator and a right wing nutjob battaling for the future of America but seemed a little too obvious \n\nThe bad news is that&apos;s exactly how THE PURGE ELECTION YEAR plays out . You could say the studio has been honest and constructed a trailer that is refreshingly accurate and what you see is what you get but is a backhanded compliment really a compliment ? Worse than that the trailer is edited in chronological order and there&apos;s no surprises . One great thing about ANARCHY was that the story revolved around the mystery and the enigma of the mysterious violent anti-hero who had his own motives for trawling the streets during purge night . Here there&apos;s no mystery or character development . Here Sgt Leo is a knight in shining white armour saving the Senator from the fascist establishment and purgers thereby trying to save America from its extreme elements . Everything is black and white and painlessly simplistic . Everyone is good or bad with no in-between and no ambiguity involved \n\nBeing positive about this at least the dichotomy of the characterisation means no one is going to confuse the noble and genuine Senator Charlie Roan with any female politician running for President in 2016 so at least the film can&apos;t be accused of being cheerleaders for present American party politics . It also contains the occasional haunting image such as a body lying burning in a street , but there&apos;s nothing here that matches the impact of a burning bus driving along a road or the nail biting heart stopping tension of the hunting ground we saw in the second movie . Don&apos;t get me wrong ELECTION YEAR is still better than the original film and if you loved ANARCHY you&apos;ll probably like this one . The downside is that you had hoped for something a bit better and are left feeling rather disappointed by a rather predictable movie",

      "name": "You can feel the potential for a great film here, but there are sadly a few issues holding &quot;Sphere&quot; back from being anything more than &quot;ok.&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "Fantastic performances from some true talent. Wonderful direction from a great artist. Some well executed sequences of horror and suspense. An interesting first-act. Wonderful music and design. And a fairly good piece of source material in the form of a Michael Crichton novel.\n\nI just don&apos;t get how &quot;Sphere&quot; wasn&apos;t a wonderful film!\n\nYou can feel so much potential in that opening half-hour. And there are so many good elements at play. But it just sort-of falls apart at times. It feels unfinished. (A sentiment also echoed by one of its stars, Dustin Hoffman.) It feels like it could use some tightening in some spots, some additional scenes in other places, some more work with the pacing and maybe a re-shoot or two. Then it could be a great, wonderful film. As it is now, it&apos;s merely &quot;ok.&quot;\n\nWhen a team consisting of a psychologist, mathematician, biologist and an astrophysicist are sent 1,000 feet below the surface of the ocean to investigate what could be an crashed alien spaceship, things take a bizarre turn when two revelations are unveiled. First, the ship might actually be human in origin, and second... a mysterious spherical object is found in storage on the ship, and it&apos;s influence could lead to the brink of disaster.\n\nThe performances are almost universally incredible in this film. Featuring the aforementioned Dustin Hoffman, we are also treated to the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Sharon Stone, Liev Schreiber, Queen Latifah and Peter Coyote. And all are able to make a good impact, even when the script and storyline don&apos;t give them too much development as characters. The talent elevates the experience.\n\nDirector Barry Levinson does some incredible work here as well. Levinson (responsible for some great films) really treats the audience with a combination of intimacy and spectacle from scene to scene. His sense of storytelling, like the acting, elevates the entire feature. (Particularly admirable are some great scenes of horror and suspense. Levinson makes some interesting choices as to what he chooses to show and what he chooses to hide.)\n\nAnd many other aspects of the production are equally high in quality. Elliot Goldenthal&apos;s score is magnificent and haunting. The cinematography of Adam Greenberg is perfect and gives a great aesthetic. Visual and practical effects are almost uniformly excellent. (Save for one or two &quot;gory&quot; effects that don&apos;t quite work.) Everything here just seems to work.\n\nThe problem, as said above, is that the film sadly doesn&apos;t feel finished. And I can&apos;t place my finger on any specific aspect of it that fails. It just needs... more work. Some parts of the film feel overlong and in need of trimming. Other parts are abrupt and feel like scenes and shots are missing. Some moments feel contrived and out of context. The pacing is all over the map. And it betrays everything that works so well. It&apos;s just a bit too sloppy in its current form.\n\nI honestly think that if the film was given another month or so of time for post-production and editing (and maybe a week or two of re-shoots), it would have been infinitely better. Heck, it might have even been great.\n\nBut as is, the film&apos;s troubled storytelling and inconsistent pacing all but ruin the experience. Although I will contend that there is enough good here to make &quot;Sphere&quot; worth checking out. Even if only once for the sake of curiosity.\n\nI give it about an average 6 out of 10. I&apos;d say check it out if you see it on cable or available to rent. You just might like it.",

      "name": "A masterpiece of an understudy into human grief!",
      "reviewBody": "BLEU (TROIS COLEURS) / France/Poland 1993 (4 STARS) 23 January 2004: The thing that stands out most about Blue is the expression (or lack there of) of grief. How does a woman, seemingly fulfilled by happiness, react when that happiness is yanked away in one telling moment, in a car accident in which both her husband and her daughter pass away? That is the central understudy - a strong woman&apos;s attempts at finding purpose in the seeming absence of meaning.  Mise-en-scene: I watched an interview with Juliette Binoche, where she mentions that Kieslowski refused to make the film unless it had her in it. It&apos;s easy to see why. I can&apos;t imagine Bleu without Juliette  its not just that she lends her personality to the filmBleu IS Binoche.\n\n I was thrown off by the sub-plots of the character&apos;s relationships with her mother and the striptease dancer, as I was about the seeming resolution at the end of the film. There were perhaps references that I missed but the almost happy&apos; ending left me feeling un-relinquished. Given that I had shared such an intense journey with Julie, it seemed almost improper to accept that she would settle in to a normal relationship again.\n\n Cinematography: The 1st shot of the film - that of a car tire racing - shot from the bottom of the moving car establishes this as not your typical movie&apos;. The sequence-of-shots that follow eerily draw one into the compelling story-telling style of Krzysztof Kieslowski, minimalist in its approach, with a world communicated without dialogue in the first five minutes of the film.  Blue is not your typical art-house film. Its production values are up there with the best, and the cinematography by Slavomir Idziak (who&apos;s craft was recognized by Hollywood in Black Hawk Down), is nothing short of stunning.  The lighting is low key and soft, and wraps around the characters to create a mood of subtlety. A distinguishing feature is the detail in the shadows. None of the close-ups fully illuminate the protagonist, almost hinting at her vulnerability at facing the light, though the delicate use of eye-lights does well to bring alive her emotions.  The camera, an intelligently used narrative element, interacts with Julie and partakes in her emotions, respecting them and yet accentuating their intensity as she plods on in an alien world of deep personal purposelessness. The tight close-ups penetrate her soul and force us to delve into Julie&apos;s mind and share in her agony.  Editing: deftly uses match on action to create irony while forwarding the narrative.  Sound: The pace is hauntingly slow and silence has been used compellingly. It screams with meaning as it is becomes one of the more important elements as the narrative progresses. Bleu is not a film you can watch, consume and move on. Either you&apos;ll feel that you&apos;ve totally wasted your time and will probably not be able to sit through (the pivotal occurrence is over within the first five minutes of the film without a single world being spoken, and the rest of the film is essentially the protagonist&apos;s psychologically subjective journey) or you&apos;ll realize by the time you&apos;ve reached the end that you&apos;ll revisit this film at various points in time, explore and read about it, discuss it with people you respect, and try to get closer to the essence of Kieslowski. For there are two now well-accepted truths about the folklore surrounding Kieslowski, whose reputation continues to mount posthumously1. that Kieslowski carefully interwove elements that were rich with meaning and social irony, and 2. that figuring those elements out and appreciating their implications is probably a lifelong learning process."

      "reviewBody": "The Peanut Butter Falcon Review:\n\nThe Peanut Butter Falcon follows Zak, a Down&apos;s syndrome patient living in an assisted living home, as he runs away from his care home to make his dream of becoming a wrestler come true. Along the way he meets Tyler, a man on the run after committing a crime, and the two make an unbreakable bond as they spend days together learning about each other. I had heard only good things about this film since it aired at various film festivals. I tried not to have the plot revealed too much to me which I think benefits sometimes. I was very surprised to see how many people went to see this film at 10 in the morning. That was giving me high hopes. Also the almost perfect critic and audience score told me something as well. What a heart warming film. We haven&apos;t had a film like this in a while that has a great message and is made to make us happy. The plot, though it can be pretty unrealistic at times, makes for a fun adventure. Zack Gottsagen as Zak is definitely the standout here. What a great performance. He has so much to work with to embody his character. He provides most of the comedy and there&apos;s no way to hate him. Shia LeBeof has finally had a great performance and I personally think the best of his career. I understood where he was coming from and how he perceives himself. One of the questions asked in the film is who&apos;s the bad guy and who&apos;s the good guy. He knows the bad things he has done and doesn&apos;t know which is heartbreaking almost. Yet he continues on with life an eventually meets Zak. Their bond was so strong where I stopped seeing Shia and Zack and saw their characters. You can tell a film is good performance wise when you forget who is playing who. I&apos;m was just so happy when they were together and the serious scenes too. Dakota Johnson plays a worker from the assisted living home who is trying to find Zak. She did very well and probably one of her best performances as well. I want too invested in her character but she provided some good topics to talk about. One of my favorite scenes was with her and Shia and he&apos;s explaining to her that she&apos;s treating him differently since Zak has Down&apos;s Syndrome and she should just treat him like any normal person and not like he&apos;s a child. This film is very good at provides good insight and a beautiful way. I realized this film was special when the woman sitting next to me started crying at a feel-good moment that was a little emotional. Great films should affect you in some sort of way, typically it happens through emotion. It does get emotional at times. It was needed and knew when to keep on a scene longer or when to switch. There was one exception with the climax of the film. A big event happened and about two minutes later it ended. I would&apos;ve liked just a little more since it ended abruptly. That was my only major flaw. Technically this is a beautifully shot film with amazing shots from above of the scenery, especially along the beaches and water. The score was good and peaceful. The technical stuff set the tone right for me. I&apos;d definitely recommend seeing The Peanut Butter Falcon. I really hope it&apos;s in consideration for awards this upcoming season. If you live around the central Wisconsin area it&apos;ll be playing at the Stevens Point theater and I believe still at the Cedar Creek cinema in Wausau (that&apos;s where I saw it).\n\nMy Grade: A-",

      "reviewBody": "I saw a sold-out opening night screening of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; last night with a group of my friends who had really been looking forward to it. Many of them were extremely disappointed, while in the critical world, Roger Ebert and the New York Times loved it. Because the film was so highly anticipated, and a number of people have asked me how I liked it, I&apos;m writing this review in an attempt to express why the movie is so divisive. I&apos;m not going to talk about plot, or describe any of the numbers. If you&apos;re interested in seeing the movie, they&apos;ll be more enjoyable if they&apos;re unexpected.\n\nIt&apos;s a bizarre and beautiful movie musical, almost a music video at times, that uses thirty- three of The Beatles&apos; songs and director Julie Taymor&apos;s unique visual style to illustrate both a personal love story and the overall conflict in the sixties. The movie is incredibly original and ambitious, and therefore its failings are as dramatic as its successes. Both stem from the same source: Julie Taymor&apos;s self-indulgence. That&apos;s nothing new to her movies, &quot;Frida&quot; and &quot;Titus&quot; have the same problem, but in a movie stripped of traditional narrative, it&apos;s glaringly obvious. Some songs are impeccably chosen and staged with great creativity, but others are too obvious, or thematically forced so Taymor can cram in another song and stunning visual sequence.\n\nFor the first half of the movie, I was frequently divided. One innovative sequence would really pull me into the style, then a forced number or awkward staging would distance me again. When an obvious, recognizable number began, I was torn between a cynical impulse to roll my eyes and an almost exhilarated impulse to laugh and applaud.\n\n&quot;Across the Universe&quot; is a mess. There&apos;s no denying that. It is poorly paced and badly structured, and at times its feather-light plot and contrived or obligatory numbers become tedious. But at one point, about halfway through, I decided just to go along for the ride. I delighted in every brash, bold choice, whether it worked or not. I let the poignant moments move me, whether or not I intellectually felt that they were contrived.\n\nThe Beatles&apos; music had a huge effect on me; from the fateful day that my friend accidentally copied the first three tracks of &quot;Revolver&quot; onto my computer, a love affair was born. Their songs are inexorably tied to memories beautiful and horrible scattered all over my life, and as I grow older, I&apos;m constantly discovering new, deeper resonances in their familiar refrains. Even when the context was vague or stretched, the film&apos;s reinterpreting and revealing new facets of these songs seemed to serve as a tribute to their breadth and greatness. Taymor&apos;s damning depiction of the horrors of war, and lyrical portrait of young, idealistic love are both painfully expressive and unique, and simply took my breath away. By the film&apos;s shamelessly corny close, I realized that I had just had a genuine cinematic experience. For all the movies that I watch, that&apos;s incredibly rare.\n\nIn his review in the New York Times, Stephen Holden writes, &quot;I realized that falling in love with a movie is like falling in love with another person. Imperfections, however glaring, become endearing quirks once you&apos;ve tumbled.&quot; I could laughingly list this movie&apos;s flaws from now till next week, but I sort of fell in love with its sheer audacity. You might not. It&apos;s extremely naïve, and thematically simple, and you could find that endearing or irritating. You may love it, or you may hate it, but you&apos;re going to feel something. This movie will not change your life; don&apos;t expect it to. But if you let your criticism fade to the background, and abandon yourself to Taymor&apos;s passionate fervor, you may have a pretty amazing experience.",

      "reviewBody": "Having missed the opportunity to catch this at the Midnight Madness showing in TIFF08, I decided to go against all stated horror movie rules and watched this today around midday at a complex in downtown Toronto.. It&apos;s difficult to know what to say about this movie really; like a birth or a death, you really have to experience it yourself and draw your own conclusions. What I will say is that as a committed horror freak, rare is the occasion when I tense up and watch a film contorted, somehow trying to protect myself from what I&apos;m putting myself through.. It contains enough tough to see horror/gore to satisfy the bloodhounds (though it doesn&apos;t feel like another attempt to up the gore ante for the sake of it, thankfully) and then - if you can watch it and many couldn&apos;t - transcends the genre totally with a jaw-dropping final act which if you&apos;re interested in the human condition and the capacity for seemingly normal people to do incredibly bad things will have you asking questions for some time to come and recognising that when horror and ideas mesh successfully, the result can be breathtaking. Absolutely not enjoyable but there again if you go to see a horror flick at a film festival and you know beforehand that it originally received an X-certificate in France, kicking up an almighty stink in the process - well, you know that an open mind is the least you can bring to bear. With that in mind I would recommend Martyrs as a film of incredible tension, harrowing physical violence and indelible imagery; unsurprisingly, the director name-checked Dario Argento during the Q&amp;A as a major influence in his youth and there is a clear and confident signature in the work which suggests some parallels can be made between the two film-makers. I loved this movie and for those who have already posted comments good, bad or indifferent (and I really can&apos;t imagine a neutral response!) I hope like myself you have come away with a genuine sense of having seen something the like of which we are unlikely to see for some time..",

This movie, and Titian AE, are part of an interesting new trend- animated films that appeal to teens and adults. I was stuck by how much this movie wasn&apos;t for little kids- the whole Tulio/Chel relationship notably- but since I&apos;m not a parent, I don&apos;t have to be bothered by that. I got the impression that this movie was animated only because it is easier(ok, cheaper) to draw the elaborate settings than it would have been to constuct sets that showed as rich a setting. My only qualm with the movie is the awful musical numbers that all animated films insist on having in them- why do they all strive to be musicals? But all in all, it&apos;s a great movie. If you too find yourself drawn to such shows as Batman Beyond, you might appricate this animation that isn&apos;t geared towards small children.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a complex film not in plot, but in the weave of the characters and how morality is completely blurred. I have watched over 100 films this year and this is in the top three I&apos;ve stumbled across.\n\nThe acting, cinematography, plot, characters and the way this unfolds, will be loved by any fans of the City of God. This is like a way way more realistic portrayal of why all this dreadful stuff keeps going on, seen from several sides of the conflict.\n\nThe three main characters - Captain Niscamento of the Elite squad - paranoid, troubled, stressed but somehow holding it together. Andre Matias, would-be lawyer and member of the squad - who discovers that being a cop will cut him off from living normally. And Neto - hard man, yes sir, no sir tough lead in the squad, spilling lots of claret around the slums. \n\nThe sets are amazing - there is a scene in the slums where abandoned houses cover the landscape and are used for a gun battle. The shells of the properties erupt like rotten teeth from the rubble and i&apos;ve never seen anything like it. There are plenty more examples.\n\nThis film is so well made it will appeal to many genre lovers. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."

      "reviewBody": "Renfield is a lot of fun, a fast paced 90 minute horror comedy that&apos;s diversions from its core idea are still funny and never on screen long enough to derail it. Underneath all the unapologetically over the top gore is a really heartwarming story about understanding and appreciating your own self worth.\n\nNicholas Hoult cements his skills at comedy with another really funny performance and Renfield&apos;s lack of confidence and journey to find it is just really endearing. Awkwafina is obviously equally strong when it comes to comedy and this role also offers a few dramatic moments as well.\n\nBen Schwartz adds another funny supporting performance to his resume, having definitely made up for Sonic 2 now. The best performance and strongest aspect of the whole film is easily Nicolas Cage as Dracula. He brings the Cage elements you expect whilst still having an intimidating presence. Even though he gets enough screen time, more Dracula would&apos;ve been appreciated.\n\nChris McKay&apos;s direction is really good, the film may lack an overall style but he makes sure the film is generally stylish with well implemented slow motion, energetic and well shot fight scenes and the odd montage. Also, this and 2020s The Invisible Man prove the Dark Universe being cancelled before it could get off the ground was the best thing as these films are way more unique and interesting.",

      "reviewBody": "There is no denying the impact the Saw series has had on not only the horror genre, but movies in general. Starting off as a little low-budget psychological thriller centred around two guys in a basement, this series has smashed box office records and created a new horror villain in Jigsaw. Since 2004 audiences have flocked to watch new victims meet their demise in an inventive and cruel way while relishing the inane plot twists and convoluted story, whilst others have condemned the series as &quot;torture porn&quot; and nothing but sick people coming up with sick traps for sick audiences.\n\nThis latest entry stays true to its predecessors and delivers over-the-top, ultra-violent death scenes accompanied by a plot full of flash backs, surprise revelations and an overuse of the main theme. To explain the plot of Saw 3D is silly, as the whole point of a Saw film is to go in having no idea about any of the trips or twists and to enjoy them as they come at you from every which way. I will say; however, that the film does end well, and the story is wrapped up fairly nicely with no obvious need for a sequel (as this is hopefully the &quot;final&quot; film).\n\nOverall the film is very much the same as Saw VI (2009) which was also directed by Kevin Greutert. Like many of the sequels this has multiple stories going at once, but it doesn&apos;t quite gel. It all feels very choppy, and after awhile the sheer amount of changing scenes can get quite annoying as it takes away from the suspense which is often built up quite well. The editing, lighting, camera-work and music is all the same as the other entries, by now it is stock standard Saw settings. Jigsaw&apos;s traps are back and they are as nasty as ever, if there is one thing this movie delivers on, is fantastic gore. A word of caution (although you may be expecting this now): the 3D is a total waste of money and there are one or two cool effects utilised in the whole 90 minute movie. Do NOT expect something cool just because it was filmed in 3D, cos it ain&apos;t any better than the post-conversion films.\n\nOn a final note, I have never been a huge fan of the Saw series, but looking back it has been an interesting ride. The first film, although flawed, had a great new concept and a shocking twist. Unfortunately the sequels took away from the first, creating a story based around traps and trying to fit as many twists in as possible. These last two entries by Greutert have been two of the strongest (as well as Saw III), but there are still glaring issues that prevent it from being a great movie. Saw fans will not be disappointed, anyone else should probably stay away unless you like buckets of blood and don&apos;t care about understanding the story! 3/5",

IT was also very funny when they are in the hotel in New York City and we find out Roy really works there and isn&apos;t rich.  This has plenty of Chan stunts with ladders, amazing kicks, and swords.

      "reviewBody": "One of the most heavily criticized types of films is the remake. The most common criticism is that there is no reason to remake something that already exists and can still be accessed. While this is heavily lobbied at the live-action Disney films of today, the complaint has been around for a long time. And while I imagine that fans of the original Wolfman film from the classic horror films look down on this movie, I have to say that it delivers a satisfying package.\n\nOne thing to note about the remake is the inclusion of more bloody kills. While I haven&apos;t seen the original Wolfman, I imagine that the film practices of the day had tame kills in the same vein as Frankenstein and Dracula. But here, and especially in the unrated cut which I watched, the mostly practical effects make for some great gore, even if most of it is caused by simple slashes to the body and neck. There are some noticeable moments of CGI blood spurts and transformation sequences, but that doesn&apos;t stop the rest of the action from being pretty good.\n\nThe cast also does a great job, which is to be expected from so many big names: Benicio del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, and Hugo Weaving all give great performances, as well as the more minor characters. In addtion, the set designs and costumes are amazing as well. The manor in particular has a great, creepy design.\n\nOne thing I did find very lacking is the character of Gwen. While Blunt is an amazing actress and her performance is still good, she doesn&apos;t do much in the film besides be the love interest. It&apos;s a shame, because the setup in the beginning of her husband being one of the Wolfman&apos;s victims would make for a cool Van Helsing-style character driven by revenge to parallel Weaving&apos;s more lawful take on the character. In addition, her inclusion in the final act greatly added to that unwanted romance element. But if you can look past that fairly sizable flaw, I see no reason to look down on this movie. It&apos;s a fun watch, and I don&apos;t see why its score is just 5.8.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Juror #2&quot; is a movie that teases greatness but ultimately falls short due to its flawed execution. The premise is undeniably strong, offering a fresh take on the courtroom drama genre that immediately grabs attention. The story revolves around a juror torn between his duty to deliver justice and the burden of a personal secret that could change the case&apos;s outcome. It&apos;s the kind of setup that promises tension, moral dilemmas, and edge-of-your-seat storytelling. However, the film struggles to make the most of this potential.\n\nDespite a talented cast delivering commendable performances, the script fails to provide the depth and nuance necessary to elevate the story. The characters, while well-acted, often come across as trapped in a plot that feels more concerned with sensational twists than meaningful development. The narrative choices veer into contrived territory, undermining the gravity of the film&apos;s premise. Instead of a thought-provoking exploration of justice and morality, we are given a story that leans too heavily on clichés and illogical decisions.\n\nWhat&apos;s most disappointing is how close &quot;Juror #2&quot; comes to being great. With a sharper focus on its central themes and more thoughtful storytelling, it could have been a standout in its genre. Instead, it feels like a missed opportunity, one that leaves you wondering what could have been. The strong performances and intriguing premise deserve acknowledgment, but they aren&apos;t enough to save the movie from its poor execution. In the end, it&apos;s a serviceable but forgettable watch-a film that could have soared but instead settles for mediocrity.",

      "reviewBody": "The Switch (2010)\n\nOkay, it would be easy to dis this movie as a canned, obvious, emotionally thin contrivance. It&apos;s a vehicle for two popular stars playing characters in their 30s who are, despite good looks and basic social skills, single and childless. They have to fall in love but life gets in the way in kind of stupid ways. You can&apos;t take it seriously, and you can&apos;t even quite care enough to hope for the best, whatever that is.\n\nBut it&apos;s also easy to like this movie despite its obviousness. Jason Bateman is a joy to watch. Maybe his performance is like the movie--glib and facile. But like the movie he is endlessly watchable, and his character is the one with the most depth. His interactions with the boy of six or so are terrific. The boy, too, is adorable and helps the movie get some feeling.\n\nJennifer Aniston plays the woman who wants a child but has no one willing to be the dad, more or less (though the viewer knows better). And she&apos;s a terrific actress, actually, even if her role here (and elsewhere) is often not as demanding as it could be. I suppose Meg Ryan has some kind of edge on her for this kind of stereotype--the lovable lonely urban girl who just can&apos;t get love right despite the obvious--but Aniston is an update on that type.\n\nBut it is Aniston and Bateman together that really make the movie glide along and make you smile. They have great rapport and good timing, comedic and serious both. I wouldn&apos;t say they have chemistry (I guess that&apos;s the problem their characters have, so maybe it&apos;s great acting) but they make their scenes pop in a way the rest of the movie trundles. \n\nThe story writer, Jeffrey Eugenides, is better known for sprawling novels and lots of interrelated characters, but even there there are little hooks that come off a hair obvious. That&apos;s the problem here, in the end. There&apos;s a big trick, a wonderful and funny hook of an idea, and that almost alone has to handle all the consequences. Some better character development would have been a joy.\n\nOh, and it&apos;s been a long time since a movie with two directors has been able to pull off consistency. I don&apos;t know the logistics behind it, but maybe one of the hesitations all along is a lack of singular conviction. Or not. Maybe this is such a formula product any number of directors could have chipped in.\n\nWatch it for the two leads together. And for some fun, warm laughs, if that&apos;s your thing. I enjoyed it.",

What you&apos;d find out years later and this is pretty easy to google that Morgan was on an all vegan diet with his girlfriend at the time and as most of us know when you switch from a vegan &quot;diet&quot; to eating meat or really anything strange you&apos;re not used to. Well you&apos;re going to get sick. The liver damage he was experiencing was because Morgan admitted he was heavily drinking alcohol at the time. I think it&apos;s really disgusting that this guy got famous and made all kinds of money because of his lies. Just imagine if a person who has never had more than a salad in their life made a documentary about going vegan for 30 days and got violently sick the way he did. It&apos;s not the MSG, the spooky chemicals or any of that.\n\nIs it well put together, sure. Is it entertaining. To a 14 year old me the same way the movie jackass was at the time. Most importantly have I had mcdonalds this year? Not once. People need to take accountability for their own actions. What surprises me is that there&apos;s even a part 2 to this nonsense."

      "reviewBody": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning \n\nA former bank robber (Dwayne Johnson) is released after serving a lengthy prison sentence, with only one thing on his mind- cold, brutal revenge on all those who were involved in his brother&apos;s murder all those years ago. But as he goes about his deadly mission, he finds himself on a personal, emotional inner battle as he considers the possibility of redemption and forgiveness.\n\nThere&apos;s nothing unusual about an ex wrestler trying to eke out a post wrestling career by appearing in low budget, straight to DVD action films or maybe the odd supporting role in a big screen action thriller. And everyone would have had every reason to write off Dwayne &apos;The Rock&apos; Johnson as one such example from the off set. But here we have an ex grappler who appears to have gone above and beyond and made an impression on critics and cinema goers alike that not many others have. He&apos;s considered to have a charisma and charm that makes him a natural &apos;actor&apos; and not just another ex fighter pretending to be a real such thing. While I don&apos;t necessarily agree with all this appraisal, I can&apos;t deny what I see, which is just such. And while Faster has gone straight to DVD, there is undoubtedly an air and atmosphere to it that isn&apos;t apparent in your average such film.\n\nThere is a clever, high concept element to it in the way all the characters aren&apos;t given proper names, but simply descriptions of them, i.e. &apos;Driver&apos; or &apos;Receptionist&apos;, as we could know their real names, but we might have to be killed if we did. But Faster is aiming to be more than your average DVD action film in more ways than this. It is a cold, brutal story of a man on a mission of honour and sworn vengeance that he can&apos;t switch off, and it plays out in this hard, unforgiving way, before the power of redemption and forgiveness dawn on him and he is forced to search his own soul and make sacrifices of himself before he crosses the line and loses any sense of moral authority.\n\nWhile the end impression doesn&apos;t leave the powerful impact it quite could have, this is an undeniably ambitious and surprising action thriller that delivers a lot more than it promises. ***"

      "reviewBody": "Bob, Agent Cooper, Laura Palmer, Teresa Banks, The Man From Another Place, etc...\n\nWelcome back to David Lynch&apos;s offbeat town of TWIN PEAKS.\n\nMuch darker than the TV series, this film was in part meant to answer many previously unanswered questions, but if anything - in typical Lynch fashion - it tangles things even further, and confuses matters all round.\n\nLynch apparently shot more than 5 hours of the feature, and as much of these deleted/extended/alternative scenes are still missing, the movie we&apos;re left with feels rather bare and rushed.\n\nThe performances are excellent, and the movie is visually stunning, and as usual the plot - while confusing - is intense and riveting.\n\nBut alas it could have been so so so much more....

It seems to have all the elements of the Bruce Willis action movie, so one might think it cannot surprise anymore. Then again, you rarely see a bad Bruce Willis movie. It has the opening failure of the perfect cop, and the almost &quot;post traumatic stress&quot; side to the character who then moves into a smaller town, but carries his burden along with him.\n\nBut this time, Bruce Willis doesn&apos;t seem all that perfect, he is scared, his voice is shaking in several situations and even cries. He still saves the day, but he&apos;s a lot more... human. And the guy is pretty good at this, too.\n\nThen there are the really powerful scenes that shake your soul! Young actor Ben Foster is involved in many of them and does a terrific (literally and figuratively speaking) job! There are also some unexpected resolutions and some even less expected symbolic shots.\n\nBottom line is, Hostage is a good pick not only for the action/thriller fan, but also for any movie goer.",

      "reviewBody": "First Story- * 1/2 out of ****\n\nSecond Story- ** out of **** \n\nThird Story- ***1/2 out of **** \n\nForth Story- **** out of **** \n\nThis film is strange, but it gets better as it goes along. It is difficult to get into, but once the viewer gets into it, it is a funny, disturbing, and unique film. The plot is basically of a bellboy(played by the always good, Tim Roth) who has to take care of a hotel for the night on New Years Eve. He gets involved in some strange and off-color characters and slowly is driven insane by it all. There are four stories total. he first one is about a coven of witches who must find semen for their magic potion to resurrect a model. The second is about a suspicious husband who ties his wife up and holds a gun to the bellboy&apos;s face because he thinks she is cheating on him with the bellboy, only the bellboy soon discovers that this is just a weird trick. The third story(and by for the goriest) is about a rich man and his wife leaving his children alone at the hotel with the bellboy to babysit. And the forth is about a macabre bet involving a bunch of Hollywood yuppies, a car, a lighter, and removal of body parts.\n\nThe first story is really only for certain audiences. I didn&apos;t dig it, but I could see why certain people may. The jokes about sex and possible incest were tiresome, the witches were stereotypes and were poor ones, and the camera angles were terrible never allowing the audience to really get into the story. The reason why is because it is shown at a fly-on-the-wall distance and for a plot involving witches it helps to know what they are up to in a closer way. Normally this cinematic approach would work well, most noticeably the brilliant Peter Greenway film, THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, AND HER LOVER, which the movie strongly reminded me of for some reason and Tim Roth was also in it.\n\nThe second story was very perverse but didn&apos;t offer any way to involve the viewer in actually finding it interesting which it should have been. There is a sequence in which Tim Roth is put to inane stunt-work where he must get himself back into the apartment, even though he is falling out of it through the window. The stunt seems misguided and out of place in the drama of this story. The ideas are good, but the execution didn&apos;t quite work. Some pretty strange intensity by Jennifer Beals here.\n\nThe film takes a large jump forward into sharp comedy and independent ideas. The tone was mean-spirited and wicked. The children were appropriately mischievous and the father(Antonio Banderes) was nuts. The camera work was involving, and the comedic notes were hit correctly. The story worked and the viewer will have it stuck in their minds for days if they can&apos;t make it to the next story.\n\nThe best of the four is the last one, with quick and sensible dialog, an inspired plot, appropriate acting, and an off-kilter ending that is shocking, brutal, and brilliant.\n\nRated R for pervasive strong language, sexuality and some drug use."

      "name": "The final chapter in a flawless saga",
      "reviewBody": "Trilogies are very interesting. Some go out with a bang (Lord of the Rings), some get progressively weaker (The Matrix), some get lost in obscurity (Blade, Back to the Future), but some maintain the genius, that seemingly ever-growing bright light that floats beyond the surface of its flawless exterior. Case and point: &quot;Three Colors Trilogy&quot;. This chapter in the trilogy, being the last one, is the most philosophical and thought-provoking. In &quot;Blue&quot; we had a more visually stunning, more character-driven plot, in &quot;White&quot; it was more of a light hearted, narrative-driven story where we listen more to what the characters say than anything. &quot;Red&quot;, however is focused on the &quot;what ifs&quot; and &quot;how comes&quot;. It questions our own fate and focuses mainly on the past and the future than the present.\n\nThis chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and brings him back to his owner. She soon finds out that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on his neighbors&apos; phone calls through advanced spying equipment. All three films in the trilogies have very basic plot lines, but bring a lot more to the story. Consider in &quot;Blue&quot;, the story of a woman dealing with the loss of her loved ones. We are constantly shown ideas about the contemporary French society and how that reflects the character&apos;s behavior. &quot;Red&quot; is not only about a young woman who finds shelter in an older man&apos;s life, but it is also about chance, hope, and fate.\n\nIrene Jacob stars as Valentine Dussaut, who at first finds the old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant), whom we never find the name of, extremely self-centered and disgusting. Though through self reflective analysis, and her voyeuristic intentions, she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her, if only he was 40 years younger. Irene lives across from another, younger judge, who highly resembles the old man. This is the &quot;what if&quot; that keeps circling in the movie. What if Irene were born 40 years ago? The old man would have been her perfect match. But what if the younger judge is actually her perfect match, since he so closely resembles the older one. Valentine doesn&apos;t know this, only we do, and Krzysztof Kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every frame which Irene is in. We are constantly smacked in the face with his presence, as almost a suggestion of Irene&apos;s fate.\n\nI mention that the old man does not have a name for a reason. That reason is because it is very symbolic to the overall theme in the story. We are to compare the old judge to Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit), the younger judge, in more than one way. We learn that the old man once had someone he loved but she got away. In another scene, we see Auguste heartbroken as the love of his life gets away with another man. There are constant reminders of whether or not Valentine will ever meet this man. Even though they pass each other without noticing every single day. There is also the motif of the telephone, to Valentine it is a way of keeping sane and updating her life, to Auguste it is what leads to his heartbreak, and to the old man, it is the only thing he has left. These three elements serve to shadow the characters own psychology. It is a sort of statement about what they are and who they are.\n\nAll three &quot;Colors&quot; films stand for a certain principle, most common in France. &quot;Blue&quot; stands for Liberty (the personal being), &quot;White&quot; stands for Equality (being accepted by more than one), and &quot;Red&quot; is Fraternity (to socialize, to learn). And although this final chapter is an obvious focus on the Fraternity principle, Kieslowski makes sure he brings in the other two as well, in order to connect all three stories. For example, we see the old man trying to reach out to Valentine and enlighten her with his spy equipment, which is a reflection of the Equality principle. We also see near the end that Valentine is doing some soul searching and that she&apos;s more concerned about herself than others (not picking up the phone when Michel calls), a clear example of Liberty. And with all three principles established, Kieslowski nicely connects all of the characters as well, in the final and most heartfelt scene.\n\n&quot;Red&quot; is about where you could have been if you were older or younger. It is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone, and whether or not one person can change your life. The final chapter in the most awe-inspiring trilogy ever made, this film breaks barriers in both directing and storytelling. It is not only about our modern life, but about where life could and should be in our modern time. And although the movie is more subtle than both &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;White&quot;, it boldly exclaims a statement of love and compassion.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to imagine that &quot;Red&quot; was Kieslowski&apos;s last film, and that he died at such a young age. Nevertheless, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that ranks right up with Bergman, Fellini, and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who&apos;s never been awarded with an Oscar. Kieslowski, you have been missed!",

      "reviewBody": "Ip Man (Donnie Yen), a master of the fighting style Wing Chun despite his smoking habit, has come to Hong Kong. But he meets some resistance, both from other masters of other fighting styles and then from the British authorities who rule. Can Ip Man overcome, or at least learn to live with, such obstacles? \n\nLet me just get this out of the way: &quot;Ip Man&quot; is a terrible name for a movie, even if that was really the man&apos;s name. And having his nemesis be Master Hung? This is not how you sell a movie to American audiences. Marketing concerns aside, the film was amazing.\n\nThe choreography was excellent, the use of tables, chairs and pallets as props during fighting was wonderful. And the musical score was phenomenal, hitting all the emotional highs in just the right places, making the fight scenes even more epic than they already were.\n\nI can see this film being popular, especially with the current MMA craze: this film features a Wing Chun master fighting a Western-style boxer. Of course, this is not real, but I still see this appealing to someone. Probably many someones.\n\nThe DVD is loaded with hours of extras, and the quality is amazing. You even have six audio options, so your stereo will get a workout, and you can watch in either Chinese or English (I watched in Chinese with English subtitles, but you may prefer to have your movies dubbed).\n\nThe quote on the cover called this &quot;possibly the best martial arts movie&quot;, which I am sure is taken out of context, but it is also not a stretch. While I am not a huge fan of the genre, this film captivated me and I found it hard to look away. With the exception of Master Hung&apos;s repulsively ugly, fat son, this movie is pretty much perfect.",

      "reviewBody": "A remarkable performance by Frank Langella as Richard Nixon transforms this unexpected Ron Howard film into a gripping and unforgettable experience. The behind the scenes of the famous David Frost, Richard Nixon interviews pale in comparison to the compelling sight of Nixon/Langella thinking. It was difficult to forget that Michael Sheen was not Tony Blair but David Frost. Sheen&apos;s Frost is an entertaining foil to Langella&apos;s somber,sad, desolate portrait of the former president. Ron Howard finds a winning pace giving the true tale a fictional slant. Unfortunately I never saw the stage production and the film never betrays its theatrical origins. In a bizarre sort of way this is Ron Howard&apos;s most cinematic film. I highly recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "The third movie produced by the production company &quot;Dark Castle&quot; and managed by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis, &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; (2002) marks a step forward and constitutes a neat improvement in comparison with the two previous movies, &quot;the House on the Haunted Hill&quot; (1999) and &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; (2001). This can be checked at the level of a meticulous making and quite outstanding special effects. It is all the more positive as with &quot;Ghost Ship&quot;, we deal with a B movie. Another good point: the change of scenery. It is a judicious choice to have replaced the threadbare topic of the haunted house by the haunted ship.\n\nIf the screenplay doesn&apos;t avoid all the Hollywood conventions, neither all the clichés of the horror film, the director Steve Beck makes up for it by shrouding his movie an atmosphere of mystery as soon as the crew discovers the ship. He&apos;s also imposing (slowly but surely) a progressive rise of the tension which reaches its climax in the end. The result: we come in for a few real moments of fright and Beck, in the long run puts the spectator in his pocket.\n\nAs far as the cast is concerned, there are two surprises. First: Julianna Margulies who for once decided to give up scalpels in the &quot;ER&quot; series and especially Gabriel Byrne. An ambitious actor who isn&apos;t reluctant to sometimes act in a horror movie which is potboiler for him like &quot;End of Days&quot; (1999) or &quot;Stigmata&quot; (1999).\n\nIt is a shame that the end isn&apos;t really satisfying and suits badly to the whole. But no matter, &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; remains a nice little horror movie whose main function is to make shiver. For this, it reaches its goal. One last thing, if the movies that come out of the &quot;Dark Castle&quot; production company keep on gaining in quality, maybe will they create a masterpiece one day...\n\nNB:it borrows a bit from &quot;shining&quot;.",

Michael Caine also plays a small but key role and adds just enough tongue-in-cheek gravitas to elevate the movie. The story isn&apos;t new or brilliant, but it is fun as far as supernatural good versus evil goes. I gave it a 7, one click above its average, to acknowledge the work of the cast, which proves that good actors can make even middling material into something better than it would be without them.",

He is one of the great comedy performers of all time, ranking alongside Chaplin, Keaton, Fields, The Marxes, Tati, Brooks and Allen. This was a really popular movie when it was released in the Spring of 1997-and with good reason. If there could ONLY be more movies like this. I&apos;m a big fan of Atkinson&apos;s TV shows MR BEAN, BLACKADDER and of course THE THIN BLUE LINE. Do yourself a favor and see this movie!"

      "reviewBody": "I saw Leap Year at a screening before the holidays, and found it much more &quot;enchanting&quot; than the typical romantic comedy. The story line is simple - basically, it is &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; in Ireland: apartment &quot;stager&quot; Amy Adams, tired of waiting for her uptight, longtime boyfriend to propose, decides to meet him on business in Dublin on Leap Day when tradition states that a man must accept a woman&apos;s proposal. Weather forces her to be diverted, first to Wales and then to the west coast of Ireland, she has to be driven to Dublin by and disgruntled bitter local.\n\nBut while the story is straight-ahead, the movie is extremely charming due to the terrific chemistry in between Amy Adams and Matthew Good. Whereas other romantic comedies pander to the lowest common denominator with base humor, this one feels much more like &quot;4 Weddings and a Funeral&quot; or &quot;Local Hero.&quot; The characters seem simple at first, but we see the depth beyond them as the movie goes on. The comedy is always sharp, and special kudos to the actors who play the superstitious friends of Matthew Good, but this movie never forces in the pratfalls and dumb jokes that we see in your typical romantic comedy movie. And when there a bigger laughs (a scene at a wedding is particularly funny), the movie delivers. \n\nThere are a couple of slow spots, especially at the very beginning, but the last 20 minutes are funny, touching and real. I think it is a very good movie for our times right now, with a message that rebukes control and superficiality and all the trappings of what most of feel makes for a successful life. And our audience was with it throughout, and applauded at the end."

Many applaud the groundbreaking visual effects, noting impressive CGI and 3D experience. Conversely, the dialogues are often criticized as clichéd and poorly written, diminishing the film's impact. The storyline, though ambitious and mythological, is seen as weak, with some finding it overly reliant on a conventional love story. Despite these flaws, the film is praised for its grand cinematic universe and new visual storytelling benchmarks in Indian cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "Brahmastra Part One: Shiva, is the movie with both good and bad. Here are my views after the 1st day 1st show watch.\n\nGood: 1. The CGI which delivered well most of the time.\n\n2. Music and especially the BGM which can be very catchy.\n\n3. The attempt. India is rich with mythological stories and the movie is a nice try to represent one.\n\nBad: 1. Acting, yes acting. It&apos;s quite odd to see capable actors like Ranbir and Alia act so loudly and throw each and every dialogue out loud. Same for Mouni Roy who is screaming most of the time. There could a be a bit more toned down acting.\n\n2. Storyline. The story telling could be a bit more engaging. It is at the beginning but lost track on the way.\n\n3. Charector Development. The charector development of Shiva seems a bit abrupt. On the other hand Alia is reduced to a mere supporting character, always relying on Ranbir to save the day. A typical representation of how Bollywood sees the heroin. When you name a character &apos;Isha&apos;, you should make it a bit more stronger.\n\n4. To much faith on audience. Though I agree the movie acts as a build up for upcoming movies, it relies too much on the build up and not on developing the first one.\n\n5. Writing. Some of the dialogues are very repetative and feeds the audience over and over. Also there are too much of romantic moments between Ranbir and Alia that can be avoided. The movie would have been focused on the main theme then.\n\nOverall it is a one time watch for CGI if you don&apos;t expect much from the story.",

      "reviewBody": "Writer-director Werner Herzog, whose films have always been marked by a rapport with the natural world, takes this trademark to Laos in &quot;Rescue Dawn,&quot; a compelling, intimate account of the Vietnam conflict. Based on the real-life tale of Dieter Dengler (Christian Bale), a German-born/American-bred fighter pilot with a cocky, cowboy-like demeanor, the film goes for realism and largely succeeds. The setting is a microscopic POW camp where Dengler and a half-dozen prisoners, including Dwight (Steve Zahn, playing well against type) and Gene (Jeremy Davies--&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;) plot an escape. Interestingly, the extensive Vietnamese spoken in the film is not subtitled, which actually adds to the strong sense of isolation incurred from the POWs&apos; position. Herzog also paints &quot;Rescue Dawn&quot; as a timely meditation on the Iraq War--while Dieter&apos;s John Wayne persona (that takes a drastically different turn in the second half) could be read as an endorsement of American militarism, we see the emaciated, defeated prisoners almost as symbols of a war that&apos;s been &quot;lost&quot; from the beginning; even later in the film, the Vietnamese captors begin to show the same signs of fatigue and desperation. The whole concept of &quot;escape&quot; is essential to making an entertaining, suspenseful film (which &quot;Rescue Dawn&quot; certainly is), but also reflective of a current foreign-policy mess that should have been curtailed before it even began. But Herzog is subtle in his politics, and lets the jungle do most of the talking--once Dieter and his fellow prisoners escape, the road to a &quot;happy ending&quot; is anything but &quot;cut and dry.&quot; The director often puts us in the midst of torture and terror, but also milks moments of surprising humor to great effect, and gets excellent performances from the entire cast (while Bale is top-billed, Zahn and Davies are the real standouts). My only real complaint about the film is a conclusion that comes off as contrived and unnecessary, stretching the credibility of the harrowing realism that came before. Otherwise, &quot;Rescue Dawn&quot; is one of 2007&apos;s standout features.",

It was simple, effective, and entertaining!\n\nThe film has a great pace, with no messing about. Joe Cornish knew exactly what he wanted to do and got straight down to it. There was lots of good action, some great suspenseful scenes, and some neat chase scenes. At under an hour and a half long, Attack the Block never felt like it was dragging. It was zippy, fresh, and engaging.\n\nI wasn&apos;t massively in love with any of the characters. They were pretty cliched at times, and didn&apos;t really get much development. They just were who they were. I must say though Joe Cornish captured the generation perfectly. All the language and behaviour felt very real and authentic. The acting was decent as well, with Jodie Whittaker as the standout for me.\n\nMy absolute favourite part of the film though was the design of the aliens. They felt so fresh and unique, and just looked very cool whenever on screen. The effects haven&apos;t aged at all in 10 years.\n\nAttack the Block is a perfect film to sit back, switch off the brain, grab the popcorn and be thoroughly entertained.",

A remarkable achievement. Not a single cheap shot. Knowing, as we all know, what happened on that fatal September 11th. The time lapse between the first plane hitting the World Trade center and the second seemed interminable. The faces of the passengers, without even knowing their names, are still vivid in my mind. Extraordinary. Not to mention the terrorist&apos;s faces. So real, so human. Tears were running down my face as a chill run down my spine witnessing the terrorists as well as the passengers praying. God, seen through a different optical at different times for exactly the same reasons. The brave decision of the passengers to die trying to protect all of us is something that we in the ground we seem to have forgotten. We could all stand together as well in everybody&apos;s name for everybody&apos;s good. You see, here I am, inspired and aspiring to inspire.",

      "reviewBody": "An Americanised remake of the French comedy Le Diner De Cons (1998), Dinner For Schmucks puts together an admirable cast of comics, including Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, Jemaine Clement (of Flight Of The Concords fame) and Zach Galifianakis. I understand that his star is growing rapidly, but his name is just too hard to type, so for the rest of this article he will be &apos;Fat Jesus.&apos; Nonetheless, this film delivers laughs and emotion in satisfying doses, and something I would definitely recommend.\n\nPaul Rudd plays Tim, who works a nothing job in Generic Financial Firm #17, until his superiors offer him the chance at a promotion. The catch? He must impress at a dinner hosted by his boss, at which all employees must bring along the most idiotic guest they can find in the hope of taking out first prize. Enter Steve Carell&apos;s Barry, IRS employee and amateur taxidermist, whose unique &apos;skill&apos; with turning dead mice into works of art makes him the perfect candidate. Also circling the plot is Tim&apos;s diminishing relationship with girlfriend Julie, who no longer has feelings for the corporate drone Tim has become.\n\nThe acting is competent overall, but two performances stand out and really give this film a kick. Clement seems to take great pride in his character: a pretentious artist whose hobbies include tantric sex and living amongst goats. In fact, his character is reminiscent of Russell Brand as Aldous Snow (Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him To The Greek), but Clement comes right out of left field with excellent line delivery and tone, coupled with some fantastic physical comedy.\n\nPaul Rudd may receive top billing, but make no mistakeSteve Carell drives this film. Just about every line that comes out of Barry&apos;s mouth is gold, and a testament to the effort put into the screenplay. But it is the dimension, as opposed to just the humour, of Barry&apos;s character that makes him so engaging. He invokes real sympathy in a couple of emotional scenes that prove him to be much more than just a &apos;schmuck.&apos; And his absurdist chemistry with Fat Jesus during the climactic scene is nothing short of hilarious.\n\nAs soppy as it sounds, the film drives home a nice moral about how all people, regardless of hobby or intellect, all crave the same feelings of friendship and compassion in their lives. One scene in which Barry effectively questions all that he has achieved in his life is particularly heart wrenching and although it sets the foundation for an admittedly cliché ending, it is pleasing to see a film that markets itself as a first-string comedy still putting emphasis on genuine affection and character.\n\nWhen using a number system to rate films for as long as I have, one begins to develop a conscious idea about what number represents certain films. In my book, anything ranked at eight or above typically constitutes either a classic, or a film I think will be looked upon as a classic in the next twenty years. Dinner For Schmucks dosen&apos;t rank quite so high, but it puts up a great fight.\n\n*There&apos;s nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is definitely a case of style over substance but the style is good and certainly more than unique on its own to make &quot;The Cell&quot; a memorable and above average movie.\n\n&quot;The Cell&quot; is beautifully looking with impressive sets, costumes and make-up. Yes, it&apos;s real eye candy to watch all. The movie has some perfectly &apos;dreamy&apos; sequences that are certainly odd but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at. This movie is a perfect mix of an art-house type of movie and a typical Hollywood-thriller, that is accessible to both fans of the genre.\n\nThe story itself is pretty far fetched and doesn&apos;t always make sense. Because of that the movie isn&apos;t always pleasant and likable to watch but like I mentioned before, the style compensates for this. The style makes you keep watching till the end and provides the best moments of the movie.\n\nVincent D&apos;Onofrio is unforgettable as the serial-killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D&apos;Onofrio is really underused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once more. I&apos;m not particularly happy about the casting of Jennifer Lopez. I know that she can act in some of her movies but she really wasn&apos;t suitable to play the main character in this movie. Her character wasn&apos;t strong enough and she was overshadowed by Vincent D&apos;Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Still I felt that Vince Vaughn was also miscast in this movie. He didn&apos;t fit the role well enough and no, I&apos;m not saying that because I&apos;m used of seeing him only in comedies now days. The rest of the supporting cast is good and still give the movie a certain degree of credibility.\n\nThe musical score by Howard Shore was also surprising good and was sort of &quot;Se7en&quot; like at times. It suited the movie well and gave some of the scene&apos;s some extra mood and atmosphere.\n\nIt&apos;s a far from perfect movie and the concept is far fetched and not always handled in the right way. Still &quot;The Cell&quot; is a perfectly watchable movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see, due to its style, originality and creativity.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

There was the odd part where I might have cracked a smile or thought, &quot;This might be funny if...&quot; but there is a very good reason for that. Instead of making good jokes and thoughtful humour, the writers decided to just constantly send an endless stream of jokes at you and hoped one of them made you chuckle.

I loved the humor, like the way Issa Rae talked about her book, then proceeding to read it. I remember how much and how often the theatre broke out in laughter.\n\nIt&apos;s a story of a black writer who is tired of society&apos;s tend to stereotypes so he writes a crappy novel with intention of purely just trolling, but people eat it up and it becomes a best seller. I think in a way, the movie itself is like that; it tries to divert away from what you&apos;d typically expect from a black story, that sounds weird... from a story based on black characters lol. It reminded me of &quot;The Photograph (2020),&quot; an okay romance movie (with Issa Rae too) that I liked because of its portrayal of a love story between two Black individuals, where the essence of romance took center stage instead being overly focused on their race or any associated struggles.\n\nLoved how it was directed, the subtle yet not so subtle instances of race even though Thelonious. The social commentary was done really well and did not need to be shoved down your face to be effective. The characters are very easy to get invested in, even the ones that are short lived. I&apos;ve only seen Jeffery Wright in supporting roles but he really nails his performance as a lead here which was great.\n\nIt&apos;s a film that balances deep emotions with humor, a difficult feat to achieve. Loved how there&apos;s a lot going on without the movie feeling overly crowded. It seamlessly combines satire and social commentary with a compelling family drama, and surprisingly, they harmonize flawlessly. Despite not being fast-paced, the film feels tightly packed, dedicating time to explore both themes thoroughly. Moreover, the quick-witted dialogue adds an extra layer of brilliance. Undoubtedly, this stands out as one of my favorite films of the year. The anticipation I had for it was met, and it truly stands as a unique movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I went in expecting the least, but was pleasantly surprised by a handful of qualities the movie had to offer. Once you get past your formulaic introduction of characters, which honestly felt gratituous by the movie&apos;s end, the high-end production played its cards right, showing off some solid CGI in bursts, and relying more on the people to carry the tension. Not to mention Josh Lucas as the lead, laudably so, with Kurt Russell co-piloting the adventure, engaging as usual. Most of the drama was pretty meh to me and my biggest gripe revolves around a certain plot point that chewed up an unnecessary 15min, meanwhile we never get an explanation for why so many explosions occur on the ship throughout the entire movie. Past those, Dreyfuss and Emmy Rossum carry their own, even Freddy Rodriguez and Mike Vogel were good. There&apos;s some cheese, some eyerolling, and maybe even some unintentional humor, but if this type of flick is up your alley to begin with, you&apos;re bound to enjoy it. I just wish the ending had offered a glimpse of the survivors back home, how their lives turned out. A high 6 from me.",

Ana de Armas' performance is often highlighted, with many noting her ability to hold her own in the action scenes. The film's visual style, direction, and music are also commended. However, some reviewers criticize the plot for being repetitive and lacking depth. The character development and emotional resonance are seen as weaker points, with some finding the story and characters unengaging. Despite these criticisms, many still find 'Ballerina' enjoyable and a worthy addition to the franchise. The film's pacing, cinematography, and special effects are frequently mentioned as strong elements. Overall, 'Ballerina' is seen as a solid action film that, while not reaching the heights of the best John Wick movies, provides entertaining and stylish action.",

There are a few missteps that made me roll my eyes a bit, such as Brown&apos;s overdone makeup, but I wasn&apos;t expecting great art.

There was a funny cartoon I once read called Clear and Present Dangerfield which showed Rodney Dangerfield saying &quot;I get no respect from these terrorists!&quot;  Very funny.  The movie has some cheesy moments and some patriotic moments John Wayne would be proud of.  The book and movie are different but the book, like most of Tom Clancy&apos;s books are so long that it&apos;s not possible to make it into an alike movie.  So therefore the movie is focused on the parts with Jack Ryan and the other characters are hardly in it.  Henry Czerny comes across as the top supporting actor in it and earned some roles from his solid underrated performance.   Donald Moffat plays a two-faced president better than any actor who would have otherwise played him as a straight up mean dictator.  Like in the book, the President has no name, he simply goes by the name the President of the United States of America.  Philip Noyce does his job well at directing this picture.  And of course this is one of Harrison Ford&apos;s last great roles since he did a Tom Hanks and has been desperate for an Oscar ever since.  Overall, it&apos;s a great movie for anyone to enjoy."

In fact I haven&apos;t seen a Ghibli I dislike, even their weakest Tales from Earthsea while problematic is worth a viewing. Arietty is not one of Ghibli&apos;s best, but that doesn&apos;t stop it from being a truly charming film. As with all Studio Ghibli&apos;s work, the visuals are stunning, with the colours especially having such an ethereal quality to them, and the music has a pleasant Celtic lilt making the movie even more beautiful than it already is. The script amused and touched me, and the storytelling doesn&apos;t rely on wisecracks and action(not that it&apos;s a bad thing as such) but instead it is subtle and gentle with a lot of charm and heart, letting us bond emotionally with the characters and their world. True, the ending is a little bittersweet, but considering the storytelling it worked I felt. The characters, especially Arietty, are likable and engaging, and the voice work is terrific, the standouts being Olivia Colman, Geraldine McEwan, Mark Strong and very talented child actress Saoirse Ronan. Overall, a very charming film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was pretty good. There were some funny moments and some okay acting. However, there were a couple of parts that were a little iffy. First of all, I think the twins (I think they were twins) were supposed to be super smart readers or something, but I totally missed that. I only sort of noticed when one of them started saying pretty long words. Second of all, I thought that Hilary Duff&apos;s role was not needed, except to make it twelve kids. I found her lines and character stupid and useless. Nothing against the girl herself, but I thought it was pointless. All of the character you got out of her was that she cared a whole lot about clothes and shopping and the like. Yet, there were plenty of moments in the movie that makes it better. Personally, I adored &apos;Mark&apos; (I think. It was the redheaded one!) and a lot of the acting was great. I enjoyed watching Steve Martin and everyone else. All in all, this was a pretty good movie, but nothing too wonderful."

      "reviewBody": "Saw the movie today. Only a handful of people in the theatre but it was a 2:30 show.\n\nHere goes......... I had some mixed feelings about PA2. I would sum it up as not quite good enough.\n\nIt&apos;s a decent flick but can&apos;t measure up to the original with the scares or the ending. Actually for me, the ending felt somewhat rushed and just wasn&apos;t that scary. Disturbing, yes. Scary? No. And the pace was a tad slow at times.\n\nThe film does in my opinion, an excellent job actually, at establishing the introduction of the characters and very nicely ties in the events of this film with PA though there are some unanswered questions.\n\nWhy if Katie&apos;s sister is having problems with things going all &quot;paranormal&quot; doesn&apos;t Katie then mention this while talking about it to Micah when filming during their paranormal events. And how did that burnt pic get into their attic? But I digress.\n\nI had mixed reactions to the explaining as it were, of the demon&apos;s intent and motives outlined by the one of the character that actually uses their brain in this movie and does some investigative work.\n\nI thought it an interesting twist that nicely tied the events of both movies through the obviously frustrated demon and ultimately using Katie to get the job done though it had some help from one character that ultimately involves betrayal. People should be talking about this.\n\nOne major nitpick? \n\nThe slow buildup up in tension never comes close to delivering anything to what PA did and I really let down with the general lack of overall good scare moments and just how few and far between the great ones there were.\n\nI was hugely disappointed with this. My biggest nitpick of the movie.\n\nThe best ones take place in the kitchen and with the daughter on the couch. That entire sequence in the basement where the mother takes the baby, was annoying and fell flat. Not going to lie to you, that second kitchen scare got me though. \n\nOne of the few truly, good scare moments.\n\nAlso, the the scene with the daughter sleeping on the couch is another. Why, oh why, couldn&apos;t they have had more scenes like this? What she experienced was genuinely creepy. I just wished they had more of these types of scares throughout the movie. \n\nIt would have been brilliant. And what was the deal with the demon and the basement? \n\nUnlike others, I found the acting was just fine in my books. I saw nothing that indicated lousy, unconvincing acting for the most part. Just a couple of parts that felt forced.\n\nBut for all the hype, I still walked away thinking that despite a great job of tying in the events and the overlap between both movies, that it felt like they struggled to come up with something fresh to scare us with this time.\n\nAnd how can they possibly do a third PA with what happened at the end and the fate of several of the characters? Who gets haunted next? \n\nThe movie is going to be successful and I did enjoy most of it despite my nitpicks but still...... They dropped the ball somewhat."

The animation is really good as characters and movements appear so life-like, it seems like reality.  There&apos;s definitely the theme of &apos;identity&apos; and Mima&apos;s difficulty distinguishing reality from illusion.  Her paranoia and fear tends to grab your attention and as she asks questions, you ask the same ones.  I thought the film also played well with celebrity infatuation and the price of fame.  It really had a lot going for it and the different camera angles give a very dreamy, mysterious atmosphere.  One great shot is the zoom out from Mima&apos;s apartment. I could&apos;ve sworn that was a real city.  \n\n&quot;Who are you?&quot; sums up this movie.  What a film.  By the way, CHAM&apos;s song is really catchy.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. What a beautiful piece of filmmaking that up-and-coming writer/director Jeff Nichols (Shotgun Stories) delivers. Not only will the story grab you and hold tightly, but Michael Shannon&apos;s performance will stun your senses. All of that from a film with very few special effects and a story based in a quiet, rural Ohio town? Yes.\n\nShannon (Boardwalk Empire, Revolutionary Road) plays Curtis, a quiet, hard-working husband and father. His friend and co-worker Dewart is played by Shea Whigham (also Boardwalk Empire). Early on, Dewart tells Curtis (with a touch of envy) that he has a good life, and that&apos;s about the best thing you can say about a man. It&apos;s about this time that all heck breaks loose for Curtis. He has apocalyptic dreams and visions that a world-changing storm is coming.\n\nBeing the strong man and protective head of the family that he is, Curtis tries to keep this quiet. However, his behavior grows more strange as he builds out a storm shelter in the backyard, gets rid of the family dog, and messes things up at work. Most of this wouldn&apos;t stand out for most people, but Curtis is the &quot;normal&quot; guy - the one who is consistent and predictable. At least he once was.\n\nCurtis&apos; wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and hearing impaired daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart) are supportive and try to give him space, but the family demands are such that a husband and wife confrontation is not long in the making. Turns out Curtis has a family history that drives him to dig a little deeper and even seek help.\n\nAfter much emotional wrangling, there is a scene at a fundraising dinner where Curtis and Dewart have it out. Shannon&apos;s rant is one of the more powerful scenes you will ever see on film, and may have just clinched him an Oscar nomination.\n\nThis is a thought-provoking and emotional film that doesn&apos;t beat you over the head. Things unfold at a natural pace, in fact, it may be too slow for some viewers. The score is haunting and never once over-bearing as we battle through these stages with Curtis.\n\nThe ending may prove controversial, but I just smiled a very satisfied smile in appreciation of one beautiful film. There could be comparisons to Peter Weir&apos;s The Last Wave, or even The Coen Brothers&apos; A Serious Man (sans humor), but to me, this one stands on its own as a story of love, support and strength.",

      "reviewBody": "While watching this movie i was wondering why this movie was provided on a VOD service.....with such awesome stunts ,a strong script and brilliant acting this movie deserved a wide release .I was never a big Gibson fan but now i think i like his style of action thrillers never meant to say that i didn&apos;t like lethal weapon series but this in a way is more simplistic and tough.\n\nThis movie is seriously meant for fans of tough action movies and is not for people looking out for a highly intelligent action movie.This is a smartly and slickly written piece of work which definitely has its ups and downs.The story is nothing new, first half hour is Mel settling into prison life ,but when the action begins it&apos;s a very brutal affair.\n\nThe ups of the movie include the sublimely realistic acting of all the lead actors with Mel Gibson leading from the front,a tightly and smartly written screenplay(courtesy Gibson)and a smart yet simplistic approach from the director.\n\nThe downsides include the quality of shots taken which i think they should have taken with a much higher budget in hand and also a pretty unimpressive trailer. If only it had been marketed well and had a wide release this movie would have hit bulls eye.\n\nAll in all this movie is a Mel Gibson show which is highly gripping,thrilling and which I found is all the more absurdly entertaining.\n\nThanks to all the folks who read the review.CHEEEERSSS........!!!"

      "reviewBody": "Following along in similar footsteps as The Lego Movie, The Angry Birds Movie manages to create a fun and thrilling feature length story out of something that didn&apos;t have any reason being a film in the first place. While it doesn&apos;t have an overly intelligent script with a great moral story, it&apos;s beautifully animated, full of action, and some timely humor for all ages.\n\nAs with every animated film these days, bringing in world class voice talent is vitally important. People like Jason Sudeikis, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Josh Gad, and Peter Dinklage add some credibility to the film, but unsurprisingly, they are what sold the film to me with its comedic charm. I think that&apos;s what this film is at its core, charming. It won&apos;t stick with you with grand themes like Zootopia, or catchy songs like Frozen, but it certainly made me laugh, and that&apos;s all I was hoping for.\n\nWith all of the well-timed adult humor, there was a good amount of unnecessary &quot;potty&quot; humor that felt more like the filmmakers were reaching for laughs. It&apos;s that type of desperate humor that overtakes the ridiculous joy out of seeing the birds angrily soar through the air from a slingshot toward pigs. And yes, to a certain extent you have to suspend your disbelief as to why birds simply can&apos;t fly in this film, but hey that&apos;s canon in the game.\n\nThe central story of Red, voiced by Sudeikis, and his overcoming of his anger was very predictable and doesn&apos;t offer anything new with storytelling. In fact, his arc is overtly similar to that of Shrek in the 2001 film. But I did enjoy seeing the dynamic of Red, Chuck, and Bomb as they attempt to uncover what it is the pigs are up to. The script tends to veer off at times in the middle act, as the trio travels to find the &apos;Mighty Eagle&apos;, voiced by Dinklage, but it picks up for a pleasantly heartwarming final act.\n\n+Surprisingly charming\n\n+Voice talent\n\n+Great animated action\n\n-Silly humor reaches for laughs\n\n-Unfocused middle act\n\n7.3/10",

Result: he comes across as lugubrious. And he plays on a note of such desperate ennui that Tilda comes across as positively incandescent by contrast. She&apos;s the mother of the family, the fixer, the one who gets people up in the evening. She&apos;s very watchable. \n\nBut points for John Hurt as Christopher Marlowe (it was me, you know, not that Shakespeare!). And for Mia W. playing every family&apos;s nightmare, the teenage girl who can&apos;t say no. \n\nGiven the fact it wasn&apos;t shot on film one can forgive the murkiness of the picture but I don&apos;t think Jim Jarmusch has much of an eye for setting up shots. There&apos;s not much flow. Some awkward cuts. And so on. \n\nLots of wealthy addicts cope with their addiction provided they have access to quality drugs - Jean Cocteau being a classic example. The plot here hinges on how that supply can be so easily blocked, the panic and despair that ensues and the inevitable descent into violence. Moralistic? Maybe.",

      "reviewBody": "** out of ****\n\nThe Core is the &quot;low-budget&quot; answer to Armageddon, meaning it was made on less than half the cost but desires to be its equal in delivering thrills and big buckets of popcorn fun.  Now, whether or not you liked Armageddon is a good determinant of whether or not you should even bother watching The Core in the first place.  I myself haven&apos;t seen that Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer production in a while, and memory serves that it was an unbelievably preposterous, but enjoyable thrill ride that had a great sense of humor.  How does The Core compare?\n\nWell, if I hadn&apos;t seen Armageddon, I might have liked this film more, which is not to say that it&apos;s a weaker movie, just that the disaster formula plays out in much the same way so there&apos;s a sense of deja vu hanging over the proceedings.  There are a lot of people out there who hated Armageddon, perhaps for its absurd science or for its quick-cut action sequences, so for those who didn&apos;t like the latter, The Core would be more up their alley, though the science here is even sillier.\n\nThe premise is the anti-Deep Impact/Armageddon.  A group of expert individuals have to go to the center of the Earth to jumpstart the core, which has stopped spinning for some unknown reason.  Heading this mission is professor Josh Keys (Aaron Eckhart), who&apos;s leading a six-man team, with a woman playing a key role, of course, as the pilot, played by Hilary Swank. Recognizable faces Delroy Lindo, Tcheky Karyo, Stanely Tucci, and Bruce Greenwood round out the rest of this very expendable team.\n\nAlready, we realize the plot is fundamentally impossible.  The only people who wouldn&apos;t recognize this are those still in grade school, so they&apos;ll probably get a kick out of the movie while thinking they&apos;re getting some kind of education out of this because of all the scientific mumbo-jumbo and technobabble.  More discriminatory viewers will scoff at all the sudden new inventions that aid our intrepid group of heroes, particularly the hull Delroy Lindo devises that&apos;s actually strengthened by heat.  For me, scientific flaws are acceptable so long as it&apos;s not so blatantly obvious, but this movie&apos;s stretching my suspension of disbelief.\n\nBut those who don&apos;t care for any scientific inaccuracies will wonder, is the action any good?  The answer&apos;s a mixed bag.  Almost all the action is entirely CGI-related, so the question of whether or not you find it exciting to see an &quot;earthcraft&quot; (named Virgil) get banged around quite a few times is crucial to your enjoyment.  The action aboveground is all given away in the trailers, and none of it&apos;s particularly exciting, thanks to the weak special effects.  The space shuttle crash, the destruction of the Roman Colosseum and the Golden Gate bridge are not examples of CGI-work at its best, to put it kindly.  A 60 million dollar budget isn&apos;t quite enough to pull a movie of this sort off, and it sometimes shows.\n\nSurprisingly enough, the scenes set below ground do somewhat make up for the slack.  A crisis is introduced every five to ten minutes to keep the characters working, so what we get is a briskly paced and often enjoyable second half.  The effects work is still spotty, but I found the characters relatively engaging, the situations fairly compelling, and the Mcgyverish-solutions amusing.  Still marring this outing on a consistent basis, however, are the film&apos;s predictability, the occasionally really bad dialogue, the lack of solid intentional humor, and the stilted finale. The Core is not an unenjoyable timewaster, but it&apos;s not exactly a great night at the movies, either."

After James in Space in Moonraker, he is back down to Earth in this very exciting installment of the series. Definitely a step up over Moonraker. Great action scenes. Movie slows down a little here and there but when it picks up it rocks... literally, at one point, when James does a little rock climbing. And in this, Roger Moore&apos;s fifth Bond film, we finally get to see him playing baccarat, something he hadn&apos;t previously done and something Connery did in almost all his films. So minor compared to the international intrigue and chase scenes but I thought worth mentioning. This is absolutely one Bond film I look forward to seeing again!\n\n--A Kat Pirate Screener",

      "reviewBody": "There are two types of people in this world: Those that watch &quot;X-Files,&quot; and those that do not. I, like many other critics who walked into &quot;The X-Files&quot; movie, fall into the latter category. But it doesn&apos;t matter, because I don&apos;t believe that there are any real twists in the plot or &quot;revelations&quot; like the extended title implies there may be. In fact, I think that even the strict fans of the television show may be a bit in the dark by the time the credits start to roll. I got lost about 2/3 of the way through, but I still had a fun time.\n\nScully and Mulder, the two FBI Agents (I think) from the famous television show of the same name, make their big-screen debut in a feature-length, theatrical film release that plays much more like a clever science fiction film than a stupid one. I do not claim to be a huge fan of the science-fiction genre -- I like softer sci-fi such as &quot;The Terminator&quot; -- but I admire the hard sci-fi films that make an effort to reach those of us who many not be the most enthusastic sci-fi geeks. &quot;The X-Files&quot; has a harder task -- it has to reach those who not only have never seen the show, but also those who may not love sci-fi too much, and it does a good job. I admire it above all else for being able to do this.\n\nIt strikes a chord that good sci-fi films have struck in the past. It gets down to the meaty bits, although sometimes the plot left me in the dark and the ending started to get a bit crazy, which lowered my overall pleasure regarding the film. It&apos;s like a mystery set in the world of UFOs and alien encounters. It is, at times, quite chilling in a subtle way, and at other times quite humorous and fun and thrilling.\n\nIt starts off with a boy falling into a pit and being attacked by hundreds of small, slug-like creatures that crawl into his eye sockets and over his eyes (don&apos;t bring the kids to this one). More people enter into the pit in an ill-fated attempt to rescue the boy, and they wind up being knocked unconscious (or put into a deep sleep) like the boy. The bodies are all transported to a hospital, and that same hospital later blows up after Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Mulder (David Duchovny) are unable to stop an implanted terrorist bomb from detonating inside a coke maching.\n\nBut then Mulder is told by a mysterious man outside a bar (Martin Landau) that the bomb was never attempted to be defused. It was all an elaborate cover-up to hide the bodies of the pit victims. Mulder shrugs off the old man at first before he realizes that the man used to be a friend of his father&apos;s, and that he has some interesting true stories to tell.\n\n&quot;The X-Files&quot; intrigued me, kept me interested for the most part, and gave me a few good chill sequences, and yet I haven&apos;t seen a single full-length episode of the FOX TV show (only little tidbits here and there). From what I can tell from my short experiences with the television show, this film carries a much more &quot;mainstream&quot; feel to it. I don&apos;t really take an interest in TV shows because I find them pretty corny. But &quot;The X-Files&quot; movie wasn&apos;t that corny.\n\nThe sight of the aliens themselves is only touched lightly, and the secret promised to be revealed by the trailers and ads isn&apos;t. (I assume most people thought it would be in regards to Mulder&apos;s alien-abducted sister from his childhood.) But Duchovny is very interesting and often humorous in his role, and I would like to see him in more films than he is in. Gillian Anderson is a bit weak in her role -- in fact, my mother saw her on stage in London and reported back to me that she was so bored by her dull, lifeless performance that she nearly left the theater. But Duchovny carries along the film by himself, and the film has some good sequences. Overall, even people who have never laid eyes on the TV show will be able to appreciate this.\n\n3.5/5 stars.\n\n\n* John Ulmer\n"

      "reviewBody": "Well, if you have watched the musical &quot;REPO&quot;, then you definitely want to sink your teeth in to &quot;Repo Men&quot;, as they are right up the same alley. Of course, one being a musical and one being a movie, but still, they are basically about the same thing.\n\nThe story of &quot;Repo Men&quot; is straight forward and easy to follow. If you can&apos;t pay your bills on your implants, they will be reclaimed by The Union, and here comes the repo men into play. (Just like in the musical &quot;REPO&quot;).\n\nThere is a steady stream of constant action and thrills throughout this movie, so you are never left bored. And the ending, well that I didn&apos;t see coming, that was a really nice touch! I am not spoiling it by saying how it ends, but trust me, it is nice.\n\nThe actors in the movie was quite nicely cast. Especially Whitaker and Law play very well opposite one another, they support each other well and the chemistry works quite good.\n\nThe effects throughout the movie was nice as well. Do not expect to see a myriad of CGI effects to dazzle even a blind guy! But this movie doesn&apos;t really need all that fancy CGI, it does very well with ordinary effects and gimmicks. The scenes and settings were nice, showing a somewhat bleak and lifeless future.\n\nIn overall, this is a rather nice movie, but in my opinion, it is not the type of movie that you will watch again once watched. It just doesn&apos;t have that quality to it. But still, it is one heck of a movie.",

How he got burnt etc. In this one it&apos;s the same, but it&apos;s the change of Freddy&apos;s character that really lost my interest. Jackie Earle Haley is about as best as you can get at playing Freddy Krueger. No one will ever beat Robert Englund. He&apos;s just Freddy Krueger! I don&apos;t really need to explain the plot, you all know the plot, BUT, let me explain the changes. In the old Nightmare On Elm Street, Freddy Krueger would always mess with people before he killed them. In this one he just kills them and doesn&apos;t mess around. Nothing humorous to say, nothing, just kills them. In the original he was a psychopathic killer who hurts children. In this one he&apos;s just a pedophile. Loves to screw all the women and girls. To me, that put me off. All this put me off. So Freddy&apos;s character changed a lot, but did it work? Not for me. Didn&apos;t work for me.\n\nAll the acting was decent and there&apos;s some gory scenes, all in all, not the remake I was expecting and had hoped for. Everything about it is decent, but nothing great. 5/10",

      "reviewBody": "The Accountant 2 doubles down on the action and humor over the first film. It does however try to juggle too many subplots that are poorly connected, leading to a less coherent film and a lack of a singular, hateable villain.\n\nOn the plus side, making Jon Bernthal a co-lead this time was incredibly smart. He and Affleck have great chemistry and Bernthal&apos;s Braxton is both a lethal threat and downright hilarious. This is easily his best role since The Punisher.\n\nLike the first film, action isn&apos;t the primary focus, with a lot of time spent on enjoyable character moments. But when the action does arrive, it really delivers. Depending on what the new Mission: Impossible has in store for us, the Juarez shootout in this film may go down as the best action sequence of the year.\n\nAgain, I wish more of the character development had been focused on the villains, so we&apos;d have a central antagonist who seems like a real threat. Instead we get several boring micro-villains.\n\nI also wish the writing and editing were working in better harmony to bring us a more coherent story.\n\nBut all that said, Affleck and Bernthal have charm to spare, the final act is awesome, and this is a decent follow up to the admittedly better first film. 7/10.",

It was definitely worth its 2 hours of time.\n\nTo start off, Liotta and Stallone are the stars of this one....Hands down. Keitel and Deniro aren&apos;t in it enough to get high praise. Ray Liotta got all the lines and Stallone played..well...Stallone...in a dramatic role. To me Stallone has 3 films he can stand by when he gets done with acting...Rocky...Rambo...Cop Land. Why Cop Land? Well...cause it&apos;s easily his best dramatic role and it&apos;s in a darn good film. Not everyone was ready to see Stallone in a dramatic role but I think by this time his career was on fumes. I read somewhere where he said this film ruined his career for 8 years. Couldn&apos;t get any roles. I think at this time eh was pretty much washed up to film goers and this was a last gasp. To blame this film on his lack of roles, I think he should re-watch it and see that he did a good job.\n\nRay Liotta is one of those actors that&apos;s criminally overlooked. He&apos;s done so many good dramatic roles that I think that he just mixes in with what&apos;s out there now and you don&apos;t get to see him anymore. With anything worthwhile anyhow. His lines are the best in this film. His hyper personality and down on his luck persona in this one just flat out works.\n\nDon&apos;t see this one just for the all star cast. See it for Liotta and Stallone&apos;s performances. They really are stellar in this little gem.",

      "reviewBody": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning \n\nArchitect Evan (Keanu Reeves) lives in a nice, swanky house with his wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand) and their two young boys. One weekend, Karen takes the boys away with her, leaving Evan on his own. He gets a surprise one night when two young women, Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bell (Ana de Armas) knock on his door, claiming to have broken down and in need of a shower and a taxi. Initially pleasant, after luring Evan into a night of soaring passion, they then refuse to leave and subject him to a relentless, psychopathic barrage of violence and humiliation.\n\nPlaying like a variation on The Human Centipede set-up (and, by the end, astonishingly much more horrible than that film), despite not having much opening development between the main character and his loved ones, Knock Knock does manage to generate an interesting premise for the beginning. As soon as the girls arrive, knowing that things are going to take a sinister turn, it&apos;s intriguing to see just how this will play out and why. But after that, it just goes to pot and ends up leaving a really nasty taste in the mouth.\n\nWith elements of Phone Booth and Hard Candy chucked in to the plot, this skirts around the issue of young girls looking older than they are, and suckering older guys into going with them, an issue that&apos;s been playing in the media lately. But rather than using this as a plot device for some deep thought, it just degenerates into a relentlessly gratuitous and nasty piece of work, like a long winded, less grounded version of the superior British flick Cherry Tree Lane. Izzo and de Amis are a pair of seriously deranged, psychotic devil women, who just serve to distract from Reeves, who is as wooden as ever.\n\nBy the end, it&apos;s just started to become annoying and stupid, with only the theme from the end of Fight Club playing over the end credits to remind you of something better. You think of those two girls up the north of England who battered that woman to death in her house, and when you&apos;re expected to be entertained by something as dispiriting as this, it puts things in perspective. **",

If you can&apos;t see the difference in quality between an Ed Wood movie and Colombiana (production, story, acting etc.), you really shouldn&apos;t rate movies. Most likely you just enjoy shitting on things, which seems quite popular these days. A mediocre movie deserves 4-6 stars, not bloody 1, and if you watch enough movies you should at least learn to see the difference between shitty and mediocre. Colombiana is not great, but kept my interest up and it&apos;s clearly better than a shitload of other action movies.

Donald Curtis is an American rival who is eager to defeat him. After he gets shot down by Curtis, he brings his plane to Mr. Piccolo&apos;s repair shop where he&apos;s introduced to Piccolo&apos;s brilliant plane designing granddaughter Fio.\n\nThis is a little different than Miyazaki&apos;s other works. Most of the time, his protagonists are much younger. Porco Rosso is a much older protagonist. The world has literally left its mark on his face. Before watching the movie, I assumed it to be a magical curse. It may still be magic but I&apos;m more convinced that its a substitute for those soldiers who were left with horrible facial scars after fighting WWI. Many were horribly scarred by the war. Porco is also very world weary. His cavalier attitude seems to have more to do with his lack of fear for his own safety. There is an overall tired nature to his character and as a consequence, the world has a piece of that. In the end, he&apos;s alone. There is less magic in this one even if it is still a flight of fancy.",

It&apos;s a belated addition to that whole psycho-thriller sub-genre of the 1990s in which ordinary families were menaced by mysterious forces, and it achieves plenty on what is clearly a tight budget.\n\nThere are shades of THE TERMINATOR and the BOURNE trilogy here and it has to be said that the story is simplistic and straightforward. The denouement will surprise nobody, for example. However, like DRIVE before it, THE GUEST is all about the execution. It looks cool, it looks stylish, and it sounds cool too thanks to that thumping soundtrack. Dan Stevens is excellent as the suave and sophisticated guy who turns up to make a few waves, and Maika Monroe shows some of the promise that she displayed in IT FOLLOWS. Plus we get Lance Reddick, being exceptionally good again after his turn in JOHN WICK.\n\nIn fact, THE GUEST has quite a lot in common with IT FOLLOWS, especially the horror-style unfolding of the plot. These films share likable young cast members and a fresh feel despite the familiarities of the situations in which the characters find themselves. Certainly nothing about THE GUEST is original, yet it&apos;s thoroughly entertaining at the same time. And that&apos;s all I need from a movie.",

The film delves into the tragic story of the Von Erich family with the utmost reverence, and while I know next to nothing about wrestling, this movie destroyed me. It&apos;s a heavy watch that might be the most moving, profound, and honest depiction of family on film this year. Sean Durkin takes an unfathomably tragic story and tells it with needed grace. Zac Efron gives an absolutely touching and heartbreaking performance as Kevin Von Erich. He delivers his most physically and emotionally demanding performance to date, supported by a flawless cast ensemble as they, along with director Sean Durkin, commit to some of the best depictions of wrestling ever seen on film. The Iron Claw is gut-wrenching and beautiful all at the same time, telling a tragic story of brotherhood, love, pain, expectations, favouritism, and legacy. I found myself heartbroken by the tragedies portrayed on screen, yet incredibly moved by the brotherhood these characters shared. Hold your loved ones close!",

    "summary": "Reviewers say 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom' offers vibrant underwater visuals and thrilling action, with strong performances from Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson. However, the film faces criticism for its predictable script, inconsistent CGI, and superficial handling of themes like climate change. While Momoa and Wilson's dynamic is praised, the supporting cast and villains are often seen as underwhelming. The sequel is deemed entertaining but flawed, struggling to match its predecessor's success.",

The plot is so banal and predictable that you can understand practically the entire story from the first minutes of the film.\n\nThe story is full of clichés and repetitive situations.\n\nThe characters are even more banal than the plot. Aquaman is a generic hero and Orm is a two-dimensional villain.\n\nThe special effects are spectacular, but they&apos;re the only decent thing.\n\nIt&apos;s not a film I recommend. If you liked the first Aquaman, go and see this second film, but if you didn&apos;t like the first Aquaman film or didn&apos;t like it very much, then forget about Aquaman 2 too, because you won&apos;t even like this second film, this second film is inferior to the first film."

      "reviewBody": "After watching this movie, I just couldn&apos;t stop talking about it. Mind you, not in the sense that someone can&apos;t stop talking about a great book or show, but more along the line of how someone can&apos;t stop talking about their colonoscopy during a diner conversation. In other words, after seeing this you can&apos;t help but try and remove the stain it left on your very soul by vomiting out the experience onto others.\n\nThis movie entered with the tag line of being &quot;written by two of the six writers of &apos;Scary Movie&apos;!&quot; What they forgot to mention is that the two who wrote it were only responsible for writing the credits and all the jokes deleted for the sake of not causing mass suicide. Put more delicately, this movie almost makes Pootie Tang look Oscar worthy, which ironically enough was made fun of in the last Scary Movie for being horrid. Coincidence? Yeah, not even some sort of Karma dealing fiend would wish this movie upon the world.\n\n&quot;So,&quot; you ask, &quot;What makes it so bad?&quot; I bet your thinking that all of the funny stuff was in the previews, right? No, actually there was no funny content in the previews at all, it just seemed that way when taken out of the context of the movie. Much the same way &quot;Hogan&apos;s Heroes&quot; was funny to people who weren&apos;t in Auschwitz during the Holocaust, the previews are funny to those who haven&apos;t seen the movie. When you actually see the movie, you start to ask, &quot;Why was that funny in the preview?&quot; The answer: You can see pretty flowers if you ignore the fact that they are growing from the corpse of a man who died during a freak green house accident.\n\nDo yourself a favor, rent a History channel documentary on the history of documentaries and hit yourself in the head with a hammer. It&apos;ll be twice as funny, make three times more sense, and be only a fifth as painful.",

However, don&apos;t think that it&apos;s as deep or serious as &quot;Crouching Tiger,&quot; &quot;Hero,&quot; or even &quot;Enter the Dragon.&quot; It&apos;s a coming of age story set in a mythological environment, and so wire-tricks abound.\n\nI enjoyed it though. The fight scenes really are superb and wonderfully choreographed. The scenery is impressive, but at times it feels a bit cliché.\n\nReally, that&apos;s what drags the movie down - it&apos;s very, very predictable. However, I don&apos;t think it was meant to be anything more than a fun pretext for Chan and Li to co-star, and they do a good job. It&apos;s worth a watch, or at least a rent.",

While desperately trying to stop him from reaching for every accessible piece of candy, choosing a movie was really just a matter of finding an eye-catching box as fast as possible. The faces of Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts did the job, and I was not to be disappointed.\n\nThe story of an obviously mad taxi driver, Gibson, trying to get a well situated beautiful woman, Roberts, to share his conception of the American government as being just about based on far-reaching conspiracies is, though intriguing, hardly convincing. This lack of credibility in the story is however well compensated by the lead actors; if the incredible plot would actually unfold in real life, Gibson and Roberts would definitely be there. This movie is definitely worth watching, not for its story-line which tries, but fails, to surprise, but for the charming atmosphere around the main characters, peaking with their short visit to Jerry&apos;s (Gibson&apos;s) apartment. I award it seven pleasant and rather humorous stars!",

Especially the two cheerleading captains, they make you cheer for both teams in the end, they make you invested in both their growth and conflicts. The soundtrack is so good too, Blaque is just my jam and honestly it&apos;s going straight to my playlist. I recommend this movie if you want to have a fun, it&apos;s such a comfort coded movie, I also watch this after seeing Ariana Grande&apos;s music videos, it&apos;s nice to see all the cool references she added, I totally understand why she loves this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the best films in years, and in artistic cinematic terms, one of the best films I&apos;ve ever seen. That&apos;s a heavy statement to make, but off the top of my head, I cannot think of another film that explores the inner workings of a character so intimately and believably, while blending cinematography, sound effects, and musical score in such harmony -- but in a fashion we (as American&apos;s at least) are not trained to enjoy. I felt the French influence strongly cinematically and, of course in the dialogue, but the writing and acting was so fluid it felt like the subtitles weren&apos;t even there. \n\nThe film deals with a rare physical condition, and I was physically there with the character from start to finish. I felt each moment as if it were my own. That is a rare accomplishment in cinema. Julian Schnabel directed a stellar cast. Mathieu Amalric was unusually charming as Jean-Dominique Bauby, and Max Von Sydow was heartbreaking as his lonely widower father. The female leads were all equally impressive as they were beautiful. I don not mean to generalize them, but they were all so excellent that they blend seamlessly in my mind, in terms of performance.\n\nOverall, this film was as pure a cinematic experience as I&apos;ve witnessed in a long time. A true artist turns out a film that is truly a piece of art. Julian Schnabel takes his time in between films, but with work like this, there&apos;s no need to rush. Like a good painting, one can enjoy it for a lifetime.",

      "reviewBody": "St. Vincent, starring Bill Murray as Vincent, asks us to define the qualities of a saint, while we enjoy the decidedly unsaintly Vincent. He defines curmudgeon, a cranky old misanthrope unhappy with his life and ready to dress down practically anyone who talks to him. The film itself is an amusing character study with unanticipated turns.\n\nBut don&apos;t think you can write the script because Vincent and the motley crew of his life have surprises that do not fit the usual bitter old guy formula. The saving grace is the honesty Murray invests in the role, which requires him also to display caring characteristics not immediately apparent. That we are probably spying into the eccentric character of Bill Murray through Vincent is an added treat.\n\nThe catalyst for the clichéd curmudgeon turnaround is a new pre-teen next door neighbor, Oliver (Jaeden Lieberher), who is thrust on Vincent for after school babysitting by med-tech mom, Maggie (Melissa McCarthy). While the bonding is to be expected, Vincent and Oliver do a long dance before any saintly traits emerge. Yet Oliver learns what saints don&apos;t ordinarily do, like fight and gamble. As we learn, those aren&apos;t necessarily negatives.\n\nAlthough Naomi Watts&apos; Russian hooker is a bit over the top in beauty and heart of gold categories, she manages to project a simple love for Vincent, a symbol for everyone who loves Vincent even as rough as he is. Although Vincent could be loved for only his Vietnam experience, he does low-key, un-Mother -Teresa-like acts of kindness that could qualify him for sainthood.\n\nThat&apos;s the important theme of this tragicomedy: Being good, loved, and saintly are within the grasp of the most common among us, implying that imperfection is a constant of being human and maybe a bigger credential than piety when that sinfulness is transformed into good deeds.\n\nSt. Vincent is an entertaining film with a well-worn message, but Bill Murray, in his finest role since Lost in Translation, transforms it into holiness."

      "reviewBody": "The Rock takes a page out of the Chuck Norris bible in his rendition of a special forces soldier returning to his home town. He quickly learns things in his hometown are not as he had left them and not for the better. Soon, things come to a head and he has to make a choice as to whether he is going to put up with it, or Walk Tall.\n\nAs The Rock himself mentioned- the original Sheriff Buford was a white man in his 40&apos;s so remember this is an adaptation of a 1970&apos;s movie script that was originally &quot;based&quot; on a true story, so we are a pretty long ways out from accurately representing the original events- this is only representing the SPIRIT of the original true story.\n\nFabulous fight scenes, a tense script and some funny moments all are reminiscent of the numerous Chuck Norris movies that portrayed a quiet guy that doesn&apos;t take any bull-crap from nobody man!\n\nWhile the script made perfect sense in an earlier time - the Viet Nam era, it doesn&apos;t quite fly 100% in this day and age. So suspend a little belief.You may findyourself scratching your head as to how that could happen in this day and age.. well.. it could back then - even though it didn&apos;t really haha. However, no mention is made of the actual time period they are trying to represent- yet they mention current items like home depot and cops TV show. The moonshine whiskey sheriff buford fought is updated in this script to be crystal meth/ice.\n\nThe acting is surprisingly good for the Rock and he is looking manly in this movie instead of the sculpted eyebrow weirdo looks he has achieved in the past. Instead of looking like a dancer in a gay club like he did in Scorpion King, he looks the rough and tumble part for this role.\n\nHis attachment to his family is acted in a clumsy and weak manner but that isn&apos;t really important to the script- even if he only sort of likes his family he would still protect them with his life so it still works for the momentum of the movie.\n\nJohnny Knoxville is mainly weak but has some great shining moments where they allow him to be Johnny Knoxville instead of the stupid 1-d concept of his character that seems to be forced on him through the other parts of the flick. At times he is reminiscent of Barney Fife to Rock&apos;s Andy. :-)\n\nIf you want to READ about the real man that INSPIRED this really great story- http://www.sheriffbufordpusser.com/history1.htm (the welcome page has a picture of him)",

      "reviewBody": "When I first saw this movie in my 20s I thought it was about a bold, confident woman who runs away to travel and learn about life and love. Watching it in my 30s is a completely different story. Do I agree with all the other reviewers that our leading lady is selfish for leaving her husband, being flaky and indecisive? Yes. Do I think she&apos;s wrong for being all that? No.\n\nWhat this movie showcases is the reality of life choices, as well as the pressure and obligations of society. At the start she questions if she wants kids, if she wants to even be married. She&apos;s in her 40s and still not being true to herself. She&apos;s never had that &quot;aha&quot; moment where you feel you&apos;re on the right path. It&apos;s a commonality that a lot of people who don&apos;t have a strong sense of self will use a romantic partner to help feel more whole. However there does eventually come a point where you question if you really are truly being accepted by your partner or whether they love you because you made yourself out to be what they wanted. Julia Roberts in this role is very clearly that type that has been a chameleon in relationships, as is witnessed with her first marriage and subsequent partners following. Even her good friend states the obvious.\n\nTo me this isn&apos;t about a woman traveling the world and finding her soulmate. Cause to be honest, it&apos;s not a romance in the slightest. It&apos;s a narrative about the imperfect relationship we all have with ourselves. How we eventually learn to accept and work with ourselves, our wants and desires.\n\nIt&apos;s a good film if you&apos;ve been dealing with identity issues. Julia Roberts isn&apos;t a hero or someone to look up to, but what is admirable is that she does actually take the chance of experiencing self discovery, as opposed to remaining unhappily settled, as many people do. People do change and generally it&apos;s important to find a relationship that allows you to grow, but if you don&apos;t even know who you are then how are you expected to find that sort of relationship?\n\nWhat this movie is getting at is that the relationship with yourself is THE most important relationship in your life.",

The 3D IMAX is truly amazing, if you are already paying the theater admission then IMAX is definitely the way to go. The story is not original, to say the least, but they know it and keep it short. I liked the voice talent, although this &quot;the wiener dog has a German accent&quot; thing gets old fast. A lot of people seem to hate this one with a vengeance (look at the distribution of the votes with all those people giving 1), but it still gets a 5.5 average, so that gives you a pretty good idea. This is no Incredibles by any means, but the two little girls I took enjoyed it a heck of a lot more than Cars. Mostly harmless family fun with a few bathroom jokes thrown in: enjoy!",

What ensues is the usual &quot;survive the night&quot; style narrative with a few minor modifications.\n\nThat said, Luke Wilson (who apparently was a total PITA to work with) provides a very good performance. (If he was dialing it in, it certainly does not show.) And Kate Beckinsale was a great compliment to him the whole way through. In short, whatever their horrible chemistry off-set; on-set, it worked (after all, &quot;David&quot; and &quot;Amy&quot; are a couple in the midst of a divorce).\n\nOn top of that, the set design, lighting and pace of events are really quite good. And while there are some plot holes, this film had just enough energy and pluck to keep me interested. (The producers wisely trimmed it to 1:25.)",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;eXistenZ&quot; is like a missing link. It was clearly overshadowed by other movies of a similar nature, but I believe &quot;eXistenZ&quot; is a quality addition to the sci-fi genre that focuses on alternate digital reality. Or we could say virtual reality. It follows right in the mold of movies like &quot;Tron,&quot; &quot;Videodrome,&quot; &quot;Lawnmower Man,&quot; and &quot;Virtuosity.&quot; And it was totally overshadowed in 1999 by the uber-popular &quot;The Matrix.&quot;\n\n&quot;eXistenZ&quot; is a crude virtual reality gaming movie. Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a world-renown game creator who has just designed a groundbreaking VR game. This VR game could be played like other VR games in this movie by the user plugging the &quot;game pod&quot; (which looks like an amorphous sack of skin covered flesh) into a &quot;bio port&quot; in the spine. Once in the game the users can barely distinguish between game and reality.\n\nAllegra Geller had enemies who were from the Realists Underground. They were intent on killing her and destroying her creation so that reality as we know it wouldn&apos;t be compromised. If only the Realists Underground had been available when the Matrix was created.\n\nEven though the execution of the movie wasn&apos;t the best, the concept was great. It really was a lower budget form of &quot;The Matrix&quot; or &quot;Ready Player One.&quot; Like an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone,&quot; this movie got into that blurred line between reality and virtual reality and the possibility of not being able to distinguish one from the other. It was a mind melter of &quot;Inception&quot; proportions that should be given a gander.",

Only in the Coens&apos; world, it is not so much a matter of commercialism but a matter of respect for the genre. Half of their films are profoundly layered, with a typical genre at the &quot;bottom&quot; and all sorts of annotation and commentary in layers on the top. \n\nIts the same in abstract painting, the real stuff that is: to be good at distancing yourself from representational art, you have to master it before you leave it. So the Coens work on mastering a genre before they extend it (and goof all over it).\n\nNaturally, their first project is a straight genre picture. Naturally, it is good (even excellent in its class), if not particularly novel. \n\nNoir is an abused term. I think there are only two notions that are necessary. The first is the existence of a capricious fate, producing coincidences that toy with humans (usually humans). The second is the placement of the viewer (via the camera) in some sort of conspiracy with this fate. In some nefarious way, the viewer _causes_ some of these.\n\nYou&apos;ll have to decide whether a noir film made after the period in which it was developed can be enjoyed in the same way. It does necessarily carry some distance, the study rather than the intuition. But the hardest thing in noir is ending. These guys do it as perfectly as I know: the last vision of a dying man, watching something inconsequential but inevitable."

      "reviewBody": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)\n\n&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a vastly superior sequel to the first adaptation.\n\nJeff Fowler works with his screenwriting team to fix some of the issues with the original flick, successfully managing to create a much less corporate work, more focused on Sonic and, this time, also Tails and Knuckles, in addition to putting humans aside in a subplot that, even so, still bothered more than it should.\n\nTaking advantage of phenomenal voice acting from the cast, as well as an already iconic performance by Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, entertainment levels soar tremendously as the action-adventure sequences amaze viewers with praiseworthy animation and visual effects, as well as an engaging main narrative that expands on the origin of the hedgehogs while simultaneously developing the same characters.\n\nFun for kids and adults alike.&quot;\n\nRating: B.",

But here Dalton gives us a guy on the job almost all the time. Moore&apos;s silliness gone, in comes seriousness with Dalton. The action sequences seem to definitely get kicked up a notch. And we&apos;re back to great cars and gadgets and a henchman for the villain who is quite a nemesis, at least for a little while.

I enjoyed Hank&apos;s brilliant, earnest, and flawless delivery. I also enjoyed Irma P. Hall&apos;s sincerity. I enjoyed the score, the locale, the warm-lazy essence of Mississippi, and the mythological progression of events that is so common in the Cohens&apos; films. Most of all, I enjoyed the charm of this film more-so than its predecessor.\n\nOf course, in deference, the originators deserve their due praise, but this is certainly no simple remake--it&apos;s a retelling.

You were meant to feel uncomfortable with the decisions they made. It&apos;s not a movie about girl power. It&apos;s about these women reacting to the circumstances they were put in.\n\nThe great thing about it is that it is solely focused on the women and their stories.

He did not have a happy childhood, in fact some childhood memories for him are downright painful.  We have been married 11 years and I know very little about his childhood and what went on.  However, after (and during the second viewing), he began a waterfall of childhood memories that I had never heard before.  Of long summers of &quot;sandlot&quot; games with him and his cousins (they were known as &quot;the cousins&quot;) they could play baseball and football and kicked the butt of most of the teams in town, during the movie his memories spewed forth as if they had been bottled up and just needed to be set free. His friend actually did the &quot;lifeguard&quot; thing, pretended to drown to kiss her, and like the movie they were all banned from the pool.  They also had a &quot;scary guy&quot; in the old house that everyone was terrified of (in fact so did I as I recall).  He assures me that this movie is as faithful a retelling of a childhood in the 60s as he has ever seen, and he revels in it.  I think that is the greatest compliment that anyone can ever pay a movie and I am grateful to the director for uncorking the well of my husbands memories for me to share."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not going to tell you what the film is about because what was about for me it may not be for you and one of the many pleasures of the film is to find yourself there. Just let me say that after the Sahara, Vanilla Sky and Captain Corelli&apos;s Mandolin&apos;s adventures in Hollywood, I had discarded Penelope Cruz as an actress, completely. Well, &quot;Volver&quot; made me swallow my judgment. She is, quite simply, spectacular. A sort of Sophia Loren when Sophia worked with Vittorio De Sica. She is a mass of contradictions and not for a moment she tries to play for sympathy.Her emotion is contagious and makes us comprehend the incomprehensible. Carmen Maura makes a chilling, beautiful and unique entrance into this sublime Almodovar film based on his most scrumptious screenplay. The women stick together for each other&apos;s sake, they may even cross unspeakable boundaries for sheer compassion. The film uplifted me in a way that no other film has done in a long, long time.",

      "reviewBody": "Before I go on to praise the good points of THE GOOD SHEPHERD, I should mention at the start that the film badly needed some judicious editing. There are many scenes that go on for too long a time and are badly in need of some artful editing to get the point across just as well.\n\nAside from length, everything else about the film is on the plus side--the handsome cinematography, the vast amount of settings, the background score that adds to the drama, and the performances of the entire cast which are uniformly good. I&apos;m not a great admirer of ANGELINA JOLIE as an actress, but here I think she demonstrated skill at suggesting the loneliness, frustrations and jealousies of a woman whose life has to remain outside the boundaries of her husband&apos;s job with the CIA. Through a series of detailed vignettes, the murky world of an agent&apos;s life of deception within the government is sharply observed.\n\nMore of a character study of Edward Wilson (played in stolid, very serious fashion by MATT DAMON) than a straightforward spy yarn, it manages to hold the interest even though it uses the flashback method of storytelling that is apt to confuse a viewer if it isn&apos;t done well. But here again, there is a flaw--it covers a span of twenty or more years but the aging of the central character is never quite convincing enough. Damon never looks that much older than his grown son--whereas a few gray hairs might have helped considerably. As his grown son, EDDIE REDMAYNE does reasonably well as the man seeking his father&apos;s approval.\n\nAs for the supporting players in this story about one man&apos;s experiences in the newly developing CIA, JOHN TURTURRO does an outstanding job as a tough inquisitor and MICHAEL GAMBON is outstanding as a security risk with homosexual tendencies. ALEC BALDWIN has little to do but is intense enough as one of the agency&apos;s top men and others in the cast maintain credibility all the way through.\n\nThe story itself is rather problematic in that nothing is what it seems and not all the information is readily given to the viewer in a way that makes sense. This is partly the fault of the script and partly the fault of director Robert De Niro who also assumes a small role effectively.\n\nBut still, despite the handicap of being too long (and a bit too involved at certain points), it makes for fascinating viewing and is the kind of film you dare not divert your attention from for a moment. If you do, you are liable to miss an essential plot point.\n\nSumming up: Highly recommended for anyone with a keen interest in espionage dramas.",

      "reviewBody": "Witness&quot; works on 3 levels – as a thriller , drama and romance. The thriller elements of the movie appear at the beginning and the ending of the movie, while the middle of the film is basically a drama with a love story in it. It&apos;s an interesting combination and while it might not work for those who like pure thrillers or dramas it certainly worked for me. One has to remember that &quot;Witness&quot; is first a electrifying and poignant love story , then the thriller. A romantic thriller.\n\nIt&apos;s a movie worth watching just for the fact that is first and one of the few films to focus on Amish culture. As a kid I would laugh at their philosophy of life . The more and more I&apos;m getting older the more I&apos;m thinking they are right. The Amish way of life has many virtues - they have a deep faith in God , pacifism , sense of community.\n\n&quot;Witness&quot; is a story about cultural clash between two completely different worlds. Both cultures are forced to come together. Each one had to search out the moralities, prejudices and actions of the other. The film is thankfully devoid of easy moralizing.\n\nIt&apos;s an interesting thing that Sylvester Stallone (&quot;Rocky&quot;) and Jack Nicholson (&quot;One flew over the cuckoo nest&quot;) were considered for the role of John Book . While I do believe that they would handle the role very well , I&apos;m happy that Harrison Ford (&quot;Raiders of the lost ark&quot;) got the part in the end. Harrison Ford gives his finest performance in &quot;Witness&quot; , the only one which got him an Oscar nomination. Hord walks away from his hero persona (Indiana Jones , Han Solo). His John Book isn&apos;t stereotypical cynical and strong cop. His tough enough to be convincing as a city cop , but it&apos;s more about his sense of duty and dignity. It&apos;s interesting how the film uses Ford&apos;s real-life carpenter&apos;s talent. Kelly McGillis (&quot;Top gun&quot;) also gives a great and underrated performance , the best in her career. Her Rachel is very sensible and lonely woman , who finds soul mate in Book. Both Ford and McGillis have a wonderful chemistry together . The say much more by the things they don&apos;t say (for example the bating scene , the dance scene). The romantic plot reaches it&apos;s climax with one of the best on-screen kisses in the history of film. This brief-scene is powerful , sincere and moving. The love story here is beautiful and tragic. \n\nDanny Glover(&quot;Lethal weapon&quot;) does a nice job as the bad guy. Who could forget Lukas Haas (&quot;Inception&quot;) as the Amish kid. His cheerful , colorful face is something that can&apos;t go unseen. Watch out for Viggo Mortensen (&quot;The Lord of the rings &quot; trilogy) in his debut as an Amish. \n\nPeter Weir gives a brilliant direction . This is a simple story wit heart . Every dramatic moment is powerful and every small scene is important. Weir isn&apos;t a action/thriller director , yet he gives us great Hitchcockian set pieces such as the scene in the toilet and the final confrontation in style of &quot;High noon&quot; (silo death). \n\nThe screenplay quite rightfully won the Oscar. The film&apos;s script by Earl W. Wallace, William Kelley and Pamela Wallace has become a frequent model for budding screenwriters, often used to display clear structure in a screenplay. It is a film about adults, whose lives have dignity and whose choices matter to them just like it&apos;s a story about cops.\n\nThe soundtrack by Maurice Jarre is good , but I think it would have sounded much better with real orchestra instead of synthesizer. John Searle&apos;s cinematography is gorgeous – the scene of raising the barn is cinematic lyricism.\n\nHighly recommended. I give it 8/10.",

It looks good, has a nice soundtrack, has a (I think) terrific script, good pacing, a fun story and above-decent direction from Mike Nichols. As for favourite scenes, there are some great scenes, but who can forget the dinner scene? The whole film is worth watching just for that scene for so many reasons. And the acting I had no problem with whatsoever. Robin Williams underplays but still delivers the laughs solidly, while Gene Hackman proves he is great as a comic actor. Dianne Wiest, Calista Flockhart and Hank Azaria also give terrific turns, however it is Nathan Lane&apos;s hilarious turn as Albert that steals the show. All in all, this is very good and very funny and charming. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Given his entire filmography is concerned with themes linked to man&apos;s identity and the complexities of human sexuality, David Cronenberg is, on paper at least, the ideal director for A Dangerous Method, a movie dealing with the birth of psychoanalysis. Then again, the film is also a bit of an odd fit for him, since the script by Christopher Hampton (Dangerous Liaisons) doesn&apos;t really lend itself to the outbursts of graphic violence that permeate the Canadian auteur&apos;s body of work. The result, first witnessed at the Venice Film Festival (after the film had allegedly been rejected by Cronenberg&apos;s fest of choice, Cannes), is an interesting but somewhat hollow entry in the director&apos;s admirable career.\n\nOstensibly about the professional relationship between Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) and Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender), A Dangerous Method is in reality more concerned with the bond between Jung and Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), a young woman sent to his clinic in Zurich since her mental condition is an ideal subject for his research. Sabina, it turns out, is incredibly well-read, and soon progresses from patient to assistant, much to the amusement of Freud, who corresponds regularly with Jung about their mutual scientific interests and also meets the young woman on a few occasions. The relationship between the three evolves in even stranger ways as time passes, with Sabina taking an unexpected place in Jung&apos;s heart...\n\nWith its combination of psychoanalysis and sex, the story - perhaps familiar to European film buffs thanks to Roberto Faenza&apos;s Italian-language take on the same subject - has all the right characteristics to be vintage Cronenberg (hints of which are offered in the opening and closing credits via Howard Shore&apos;s music). And yet there&apos;s something missing: whereas the reconstruction of Vienna in the early 20th century is impeccable, the director appears to be less interested in the actual development of story and character, with a rather detached approach that suggests he&apos;s almost working on autopilot. That having said, part of the blame can be laid on Hampton, whose screenplay only glosses over key details of the story, leaving us with a quite simplified, &quot;safe&quot; version of events (the sex is unusually tame and unchallenging for a Cronenberg film).\n\nThe performances are a mixed bag as well: Knightley, stuck with the showy role, is unbearably OTT in the first 30 minutes, shouting and shaking endlessly before she eventually tones down the mania and focuses on finding the character, complete with a solid Russian accent. At the other end of the spectrum is Mortensen, pitch-perfect from the start but criminally underused, especially considering his past associations with Cronenberg. And then there&apos;s Fassbender, quietly intense and generally up to the task, were it not for his decision to speak RP English when he and Mortensen, who adopts a German accent, are supposed to be from the same country (this is even more perplexing if one thinks of Fassbender&apos;s flawless mastery of German).\n\nA Dangerous Method is thus a textbook case of a film that, while not disappointing in the strict sense of the word, comes off as a minor effort in a generally spotless filmography. But even on an off-day, Cronenberg deserves to be seen at least once. Just don&apos;t expect another History of Violence...\n\n6,5/10",

The message of romantic love being timeless and one that can cross many generations was very well appreciated and felt. The scenery of Italy in the film is gorgeous. There are breathtaking shots that make you want to hop on a plane after the film is over and go there yourself.\n\nIt was also truly refreshing to watch a film that I don&apos;t believe contained a single cuss word or sexual innuendo. (We need more of these movies). You could see this movie with your teens or your grandmother without the slightest bit of concern about being embarrassed of what might show up on the big screen. You walked out of the theatre feeling happy and remembering your own love story -- or hoping for your own love story to come.\n\nDon&apos;t miss this one if you get a chance to see it. You will not be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "Where the Wild Things Are, one of the most beloved children&apos;s books, comes to the big screen in one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. Spike Jonze, the man responsible for Being John Malcovich, Adaptation, and several Beastie Boys music videos including &quot;Sabotage&quot;, brings the tale to life. I must admit, I have been anxiously awaiting this film for several months, something I don&apos;t like to do too often as it sets up for a potential major let down.\n\nWell, that didn&apos;t happen this time.\n\nWe follow Max (Max Records), a boy who is lonely and misunderstood. His sister doesn&apos;t pay attention to him, his mother is busy with work and her boyfriend, and he has worries at school. All he wants is attention and to belong. One night, he finally breaks and runs away. He makes his way to the woods and to the waters edge. There he finds a small boat and set out on the open sea, leaving everything behind him.\n\nHe comes across an island and goes ashore. There he finds a group of monsters in turmoil. Max seizes his opportunity and confronts the group. He tells them that he is a great king and help them solve their problems.\n\nI don&apos;t want to give too much of the story away because I feel like telling it would ruin some of the magic. This is one of the most visually pleasing films I have seen in a long time. Jonze filmed in Australia. We are given vivid landscapes of lush forests, arid deserts, and beautiful shorelines, culminating in an almost Lord of the Rings like experience. These spectacular settings would rarely be beaten in magnificence in another film, but here they come second to the unbelievable special effects used for the monsters.\n\nThere are seven monsters on the island. Carol, Ira, Judith, KW, Douglas, Alexander, and The Bull. They all have unique features and are of massive size. Jonze could have gone two ways here. He could have completely made them all CG or he could have gone Jim Henson and turned them into Muppets. Instead, he carved a third path and combined the other two options. Max is able to interact extremely well with the gigantic puppet/suits, but the faces are edited with computer graphics, giving them startlingly realistic features and expressions. Making these monsters any different way would have been disastrous.\n\nAnother key aspect of the monsters is giving them a voice. Jonze chose excellent voice actors with James Gandolfini, Forrest Whitaker, Catherine O&apos;Hara, Lauren Ambrose, Paul Dano, and Chris Cooper. They each have their own personality that compliments their physical and emotional characteristics.\n\nAside from the monsters, I was very impressed with Max. He is asked to do a very demanding thing: be a kid. That sounds easy, but it is very easily messed up. I&apos;m interested in finding out how much freedom Jonze gave Records in certain scenes that called for him to go &quot;wild&quot;. I can imagine directing young actors is not the easiest thing to do, but sometimes you catch a break when you get a talented one.\n\nGiving life to these characters is a spectacular screenplay by Jonze and Dave Eggers (who wrote Away We Go). Their writing speaks to both kids and adults, using language that is meaningful and easy to understand. The things Max goes through every child feels growing up: loneliness, fear, belonging, etc.\n\nThere is so much to love about this movie. It speaks to the heart. But before you head out with the whole family, heed this warning. Some parts of this film might be too intense for younger audience members. Certain scene involving the monsters might be a bit too overwhelming. Yes, these monsters are friendly, but they are monsters, meaning they are large, intimidating, and somewhat scary.\n\nWhere the Wild Things Are will satisfy, entertain, and open your eyes. Spike Jonze poured everything he had into this film and the wait was well worth it. I hope you will fall under its spell just as I did.",

This movie just goes in depth on a day-in-the-life, of normal people working in a small restaurant. It shows when the day begins, all the way to the end of the shift. Another thing about this movie that made it so funny was a game that the men of the restaurant played. This game involves making somebody &quot;unwillingly&quot; look at their package down below. Well as you can see, the movie is hilarious and I definitely recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "This adaptation of Anna Karenina is a very flat adaptation of one of the greatest pieces of literature, but actually it is not only a failure as an adaptation but disappointing also on its own merits. It is not without its redeeming qualities of course, the costumes and sets are gorgeous and some of the best of the year, the music is beautifully composed, Jude Law is a superbly restrained and dignified Karenin and Matthew Macfadyen and Domhnall Gleeson are similarly excellent as Stiva and Levin respectively. Keira Knightley in the title role however didn&apos;t do it for me. She tries but comes across as too young and too selfish, and I also didn&apos;t care at all for her over-earnest mannerisms. The weak link of the cast is the woeful miscast that is Aaron Taylor-Johnson&apos;s Vronsky, often too moody and wooden as well as too effeminate and foppish, so much so it comes across as creepy. The script is very stilted and lacking in any kind of heart. There is a lot of melodrama as well but it comes across as forced, while the switching from play-within-a-play to film is confusing. The story similarly suffers from pedestrian pacing and the drama and characters are too thin to make us properly care and that is including Anna, whose attempts to overcome her suffering is entirely too trivialised here. Even bigger of a problem was Joe Wright&apos;s direction, I loved Pride and Prejudice and especially Atonement so I hoping a similar kind of directing job. But Wright often seems to be paying attention to himself too much, with the camera work too incongruous and surreal. Everything, from the gimmicky theatrical elements to the ball scene where the dancing is so robotic and where you don&apos;t have a clue what dance style it&apos;s supposed to be, plays too much of an overblown musical but without song and dance. In conclusion a disappointment even on its own, for me a beautiful bore is a very apt summing up as to how I felt about it. See the Greta Garbo and Vivien Leigh films instead. 4/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "The style of this movie and how the story unfolded makes me rank this an 8. As a fan of massive attack I was taken by how dark and edgy the texture of the movie became due to their soundtrack.\n\nIt&apos;s obvious that the production team of Luc Besson&apos;s has a larger budget to work with. And they are exploring ways to tell an action story. Transporter 1 was better than 2 because of the soundtrack. And here again the music compliments the emotional content.\n\nGranted, some of the characters and scenes did appear amateurish, but the pieces are being put together. If the production team keep going, they&apos;ll strike the right chord.\n\nAnd yes, Jet Li is beginning to evolve as an actor, which I suspected after watching Lethal Weapon 4 again. He&apos;s the best thing in that movie.\n\nHowever, this movie does require an appreciation for the medium and not just a need for escapism.",

      "name": "A coming of age story sprinkled with mystery elements and a fun road trip",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;What a treacherous thing to believe that a person is more than a person.&quot;\n\nThanks to the worldwide success of The Fault in Our Stars which was adapted from John Green&apos;s 2012 novel, the producers have decided to adapt some of his earlier work as well. Teaming up with the same screenwriters, Michael Weber and Scott Neustadter, casting Nat Wolff again (although this time as the lead), and hiring a new director, Jake Schreier (Robot and Frank), they had everything in place and ready to adapt Green&apos;s 2008 novel, Paper Towns, with the hopes of banking on the author&apos;s current fanbase. Although Paper Towns is similarly aimed towards a teen audience, it is very different from The Fault in Our Stars. It&apos;s a coming of age story that includes some mystery elements and ends up turning into a road trip movie. So despite following certain generic conventions in the teen genre it does manage to mix things up a bit and that was something I enjoyed. Everything else about Paper Towns including its characters are pretty familiar. \n\nThe film begins as a typical boy becomes infatuated with girl story, but it soon develops into much more than that. In Paper Towns this boy is Quentin (Nat Wolff) and the girl next door he falls for is Margo (Cara Delevinge). They shared a friendly past, the two hung out together as kids, but when they became older Margo&apos;s adventurous and wild behavior didn&apos;t go along with Quentin&apos;s much risk free and calm demeanor. During their senior year of High School, Margo was on her way to being the prom queen, while he was just the kids that went unnoticed. His two best friends, Radar (Justice Smith) and Ben (Austin Abrams), were aware of his obsession over her, but he never acted upon it. One night, Margo climbs through his window using her ninja skills as she used to when they were kids, and asks him to join her on one last mission. Apparently her boyfriend has been cheating on her with her best friend and she wants to get some payback. She asks him to drive her around on his mother&apos;s minivan and after the successful mission Quentin admits never having felt so much fun before. The next day, hopeful to resume his new found friendship with Margo he discovers that she has gone missing, but she has left some clues behind for him. With the help of Radar and Ben the three begin to try to solve the mystery of Margo&apos;s disappearance. Lacey (Halston Sage), one of Margo&apos;s closest friends, also decides to join the kids in trying to find her since they seem to be the only ones worried about her. \n\nMichael Weber and Scott Neustadter are definitely the two screenwriters you want to hire for adapting teen based novels. This is perhaps their weakest effort, but it still stands above most other teen rom-coms. 500 Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now were both very well written screenplays with interesting characters and relationships, while The Fault in Our Stars banked on the the strong chemistry between Woodley and Elgort. Wolff in that film delivered most of the comedic scenes, but here he downplays his character and lets Abrams deliver most of the funny quirky scenes. Delevinge embodies her wild character pretty well, but considering she is missing throughout most of the movie she doesn&apos;t get much screen time. That is what makes Paper Towns such a rare teen romance because the girl is missing throughout most of the story and the focus is on Quentin&apos;s quest to find her. It&apos;s more about idealizing the other person and discovering that in reality they are simply a person. The mystery and the road trip is what makes this film stand out from other films in the genre and it makes the ride all that more enjoyable, but when compared to other coming of age films it probably ranks in the middle. The film shares some similarities with The Girl Next Door, which was a film I enjoyed a lot more probably because I was younger when I saw it. Paper Towns is a film for teens and if you&apos;re not in that target audience you might find it a bit difficult to enjoy. There is one scene in the movie that reminded me of this when during a cameo all the teen girls in the audience sighed at the sight of him. \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

Someone said at one point they found themselves rooting for him. I never did, but that&apos;s because at my age, it&apos;s hard to fool me after all the phonies I&apos;ve met.\n\nSome people will be disappointed because we didn&apos;t get to see all the horror he visited on women, but it was a refreshing change of emphasis here.\n\nTo see the young women salivating over him in the courtroom, cheering him on, was both shocking and expected. Real footage was used. I remember women doing that over the Menendez brothers.\n\nPart of it is the old takeoff on a Geraldo Show - &quot;Men in Prison and the Women Who Love Them,&quot; a phenomenon that happens time and time again. With Bundy, because he was particularly good-looking, it was an even stronger reaction.\n\nZac Efron is a favorite of mine -he resembles my favorite classic film star, Tyrone Power, and I thought he captured the charm and personality of a whack job really well. Lily Collins is terrific as his girlfriend. Both of these actors are growing into exceptional performers.\n\nIn the end &quot;Extremely Wicked&quot; makes a sad statement. Good looks. Confidence, and charm will bring you a long way in this world. We&apos;ve seen it too often. It&apos;s time to start looking at people&apos;s souls. The external is, after all, only that.",

      "reviewBody": "Alpha Dog starts off as what seems like a movie all about a group of friends who life their idea of the American dream: doing drugs, having sex, and hanging out with each other not a care in the world. However, when their leader, Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch), decides to kidnap the brother (Anton Yelchin) of a man (Ben Foster) who owes him drug money, their perfect world begins to shatter as they realize that their mindless prank has become a situation that could get them stuck in jail for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe acting is pretty good considering the cast is mostly young men with little to no experience. First, you have Anton Yelchin, whom the plot centers around. He is the young man trying to grow up, and finds a real sense of comfort in his captors, as weird as it sounds. He does a great job building a likable, yet flawed character. The film definitely displays likable characters, but the audience has to remember that these characters are not good people. Ben Foster has always been around in my eyes, and he delivers his most intense role yet as the scary and sadistic Jake Mazursky. Very good job. Emile Hirsch is steadily developing into a good leading man after nice turns in Lords of Dogtown and The Girl Next Door. He&apos;s the leader of the group, and he has a certain presence despite his small size that reminds the viewer who&apos;s in command. Sharon Stone continues to defy my expectations of her after watching her in Bobby and this film. Very intense and powerful performance, which is very heartfelt at the end of the film. However, none of these performances stack up close to that of GASP Justin Timberlake. Timberlake really stood out to me in the film as Frankie, Johnny&apos;s best friend. He develops a strong friendship with Yelchin&apos;s character, and Timberlake really steals the show the whole time. His character is the most believable and likable of the bunch. Bruce Willis and Shawn Hatosy are also good in limited screen time (I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen Willis have this much hair in a long time).\n\nNick Cassavetes does a good job as director, giving us the exact opposite of his most famous work to date, The Notebook. He delivers the gritty and realistic feel of 1999 Southern California and gets great performances out of actors who you don&apos;t really expect it from. The film definitely was better than I expected because of Justin Timberlake. I thought he would make the film worse but he made it better. It has some sex scenes and nudity, not to mention a lot of language, so Alpha Dog isn&apos;t really appropriate for anyone under 16 or 17. With a good ensemble cast, a good script, good direction, and a heart wrenching climax, Alpha Dog is a good movie to watch.\n\n8/10 --spy",

      "reviewBody": "Money Monster (2016) \n\n** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nLee Gates (George Clooney) is a hot shot financial TV personality who offers up advice on what stocks to buy and which ones to sell. His director (Julia Roberts) is on her last show when they&apos;ve scored an interview with a big CEO but when he backs out they don&apos;t realize how worst the day is going to get. Soon Kyle Budwell (Jack O&apos;Connell) bursts into their studio and on live television he takes over the show carrying a gun and a bomb.\n\nMONEY MONSTER comes from director Jodie Foster and I must admit that I went into it with incredibly high expectations. Whether people like it or not Clooney had done many great movies and delivered many great performances over the past decade so I thought with him and Foster together we&apos;d get a hard-hitting drama that would take down the ugly side of Wall Street. Well, the movie was entertaining while you watched it but afterwards I couldn&apos;t help but feel extremely disappointed because when you get down to it the film was pretty shallow.\n\nThere&apos;s a great film hidden somewhere in here but it seems that they had to simple everything down so that your average viewer wouldn&apos;t get lost. I can only imagine what this could have been if someone like the late Sidney Lumet had been able to make it and the screenplay was allowed to be much more hard hitting and really go after the bad guys. This film starts off on a highly unlikely plot device (getting into the studio so easily) and by the final act it completely falls apart with its rather stupid plot twists.\n\nWith that said, the movie is still slightly entertaining to a point. Foster does a good job in her directing duties but there&apos;s no question that a new screenplay was needed. Both Clooney and Roberts work extremely well together and both give fine performances. Clooney does a good job at playing the charm but as the drama builds he also manages to sell that. O&apos;Connell is also very good in his role of the man who finds himself in a desperate place so he reaches for a rather dumb idea.\n\nMONEY MONSTER has its heart in the right place but it just seems like one of those movies that doesn&apos;t want to be too serious or too finger pointing and instead of any hard hitting drama and questions we&apos;re just left with a rather mindless action film with an unlikely plot. It&apos;s really too bad because with the talent involved this should have been so much better."

This, right here, is and still remains the definitive Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. This got the vision laid out by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird most accurately: A dark, edgy, tongue-in- cheek parody to Frank Martin, Daredevil, Cerebus and New Mutants. Sure, you still had some of the cartoon elements thrown in for good measure (the colored masks, the surfer lingo), but compare this one to the other movies and this one followed the closest to the original comic book series, which was written for adults. The violence has been toned down significantly, as has the cursing, but it&apos;s there, on a lower level. As a kid, I was confused about why this was so dark and almost scary. Later, reading the underrated comic books, I learned this was what TMNT was originally envisioned as. Eventually, toy sales and Saturday morning TV won over the comic book, but here, for one brief movie, the turtles, as they were meant to be seen by their original creators, got their time in the sun. The writing isn&apos;t terrific and the acting not award winning, but still a fun movie to watch from time to time.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; is a &quot;splatter Western,&quot; directed by horror vet Sam Raimi (whose latest, as of this writing, is &quot;Spider-Man,&quot; but who cut his teeth on the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; trilogy).  It&apos;s set in the oh-so-ironically named lawless town of Redemption, a haven of grotesques that gives us an idea what the wild West would&apos;ve looked like if had been painted, not by Frederic Remington, but by Heironymus Bosch.  \n\nIn a surfeit of Biblical nomenclature, the town&apos;s mayor/owner/capo is named Herod (Gene Hackman at his oiliest, complete with bad hair).  Into town there rides a mysterious stranger, not Clint Eastwood this time but Sharon Stone.  I&apos;m not the world&apos;s biggest Stone fan, but this movie and &quot;Total Recall&quot; indicate that she has her uses in kick-butt action roles that make no demands on her limited thespianic skills.  As gunslinger Ellen, she&apos;s doubly armed--with a six-shooter, and with an axe to grind; even her &quot;inner child&quot; packs a gun.  She enters Herod&apos;s to-the-death fast-draw tournament, a no-win, no-exit, potentially no-survivors affair, with an agenda on her mind other than just winning the prize money.  \n\nThis is an overripe, over-wrought movie, but it mostly works.  Raimi all but erases the slim wall between the horror and Western genres:  Redemption is another Transylvanian village of simple peasants lorded over by by an evil baron, and the atmosphere--palpably oppressive and claustrophobic--could be cut with a knife.  Leonardo di Caprio and veteran character actors Lance Henriksen and Roberts Blossom effectively round out the cast, and the action scenes--exaggerated, mythic, often darkly humorous--deliver.  If you&apos;re more of a horror fan than a Western fan, this may be the Western for you."

      "reviewBody": "Well I can safely say I did not expect that film to be that good. It&apos;s absolutely outstanding. Amazing acting, brilliant storyline and the characters are so good. It&apos;s genuinely got the whole package.\n\nFirst 20 minutes or so I was a bit 50/50 on what was happening. There was 2 storylines and no real direction for either. Then it slowly starts falling into place and it gets better and better and better. And that&apos;s the only real negative I have to offer on this film. Maybe another negative is that I personally would have liked a little more depth on the 2 police officers. You are offered very little on them and it doesn&apos;t particularly take anything away from this movie, just would have liked to have known more. Like why is he so hellbent on wanting to catch these etc\n\nBut that&apos;s honestly nit picking because this really is a great film. The idea of the past/present storylines then merging was done absolutely brilliantly and best of all his character arc was simply superb. And to top it off it gives off a great message about people being institutionalised and what can happen to low offenders.\n\nFor a film I genuinely never heard of before, this genuinely blew me away. The only reason I haven&apos;t gone higher on ratings is that I have given films like the the departed and shutter island 9/10 and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s on that sort of level. But I&apos;d go 8.5/10 on this. Please give this a watch if you haven&apos;t already.",

That John Woo stuff just rubs me the wrong way and I find it so pretentiously distracting! ugh.\n\nBut beyond that... if you want an entertaining &quot;don&apos;t need to think about it flick&quot;, The Losers generously provides.

Hugh grant may have been in his usual role of self depreciating charming English Gent who is living on his past pop star glory but the dialogue and one liners gave his role substance. He more than gave justice to them by his superb timing. Drew Barrimore also fell into the part as a woman who comes to feed the plants and ends up feeding ideas to him for a song in which he cant complete. The acting was spot on, the one liners witty but I think it was the music added joy to the film. As he said in the film don&apos;t quote me on this but something like &quot; there is nothing like a good song for lifting your spirits in a second.&quot; I left this film feeling happy not only for the characters but in myself.!",

Cool dance scene though, and Freddie Prinze Jr. is bearable Rachel Leigh Cook is likable (I personally thought she was pretty good in it) and notably talented actors like Kevin Pollak, Kieran Culkin, and Anna Paquin give the movie some supporting foundation.

But this movie is actually quite good. You see, it&apos;s not some ridiculous, rah-rah military movie; it sides with the Gorgonites (the soldiers&apos; adversaries), showing how - whether or not they win or lose - they always remain supportive of each other.\n\nAs for the cast members, this is a Joe Dante movie, so Dick Miller and Robert Picardo get supporting roles. In this case, they play a delivery man and clean room technician, respectively. Phil Hartman is probably the funniest cast member, playing the ultimate suburban consumer (he wants to remove his neighbor&apos;s tree to make room for a satellite dish). All in all, this is definitely a movie worth seeing. As far as I remember, Joe Dante always does a good job.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s interesting how this movie seems to be a watershed for mma. Mixed martial arts really are making the transition from underground, extreme bleeding-edge expressions of combat sport to a mainstream and accepted pastime, and that shows in the commentary about this film. Those who have a clue about mma aren&apos;t saying the same things as those who don&apos;t.\n\nI have no patience for critics, anyway. They&apos;re worse than academics, really, and nothing they say can be trusted. You want to know if a movie sucked? Listen to the people.\n\nThis movie didn&apos;t suck. Okay, it wasn&apos;t Cool Hand Luke, but is that really what you were expecting when you saw the advance poster? It went to great lengths to make a Classical reference from the Iliad significant thematically, and how often does a &quot;teensploitation&quot; flick do that? It even employed a little finesse in some of the on-screen relationships, and in ways that seemed to hold a little verisimilitude, even. If the filmmakers had made Jake Tyler a gay youth fighting for free speech in the school newspapers, the critics would have loved it. All they saw was scary teen violence, so theywell, less than loved it.\n\nTruth is that the movie isn&apos;t really glorifying violence; it&apos;s glorifying the quotidian, although it does seem to consider violence an acceptable means to an end. If you like mixed martial arts and you&apos;re not too delicate to watch stylized violence, rent it when it comes out. If you&apos;d really rather watch 27 Dresses (you know who you are) tell your boyfriend it&apos;s chick flick time.",

      "reviewBody": "While Ian Fleming created a great character in 007, time is wilting away the logic to a lot of the plots to the early films in this series. While this one still has touches of the Cold War Theme, the plot actually holds up better over time than some of the other films. In fact, this film does very well with the location shots being scenic including the Eifel Tower &amp; Golden Gate Bridge in the same film.\n\nEven though Flemming&apos;s material is long gone by this time the plot in this film actually holds together quite well. Actually, in a way the plot borrows on the plot of Goldfinger replacing Gold with sand. This does hold the film together quite well. The biggest problem with this film is Tanya Roberts, on my list the second worst Bond girl. Trouble is there is nothing good to balance her here &amp; since her poor performance dominates the film, we are stuck with her here.\n\n(In case your wondering, the worst Bond Girl of the entire series is Lynn-Holly Johnson. In FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, Lynn proved she can&apos;t act, &amp; couldn&apos;t even be a believable skater even though in real life she is one. Carol Bouquet balances her off because she is one of the best Bond women ever, because without her, Lynn would have killed the series off for Moore sooner.) Christopher Walken is good as the heavy in this. Grace Jones does a good turn as &quot;Mayday&quot; also. \n\nRoberts is the reason this ended Roger Moore&apos;s reign as 007. Maybe this is a good thing, but I wish they could re-shoot it with another better actress (not Johnson) because this film is good. The scenery is good, and the rest of the cast brings this off well. The stunts in this one are top notch too. This film grows on you when you watch it. There are times when Moore&apos;s advanced age shows up plainly though.",

Very similar to his latter film Blue Velvet, two young lovers&apos; affection is spoiled by an endless parade of perverted psychos who never seem to give up. The cast is as Lynchian as it gets (Although Kyle MacLachland is missing), with Laura Dern, Diane Ladd and Sherilyn Fenn. Willem Dafoe is hideous enough as the top villian (If you can&apos;t get Dennis Hopper or Christopher Walken), and Cage and Dern also performs neat. The films contains every kind of perversion and violence you can think of so you better be prepared!"

      "reviewBody": "Stylishly directed, jam-packed with chases and keeping the fun aspect alive for the most part if not all the way, Ambulance moves into top gear relatively quick and never takes the foot off the pedal once it gets going but the road it takes to reach its destination ends up being longer than what the gas in the tank can handle, thus resulting in a ride that&apos;s running on fumes way before the end is in sight.\n\nDirected by Michael Bay, the premise is simple, setup is quick &amp; thrills are endless even if much of the narrative elements seem underdeveloped. Bay utilises his usual unabashed over-the-top approach that provide his standard blockbuster fares an explosive, extravagant flavour and he amplifies the nonstop action some more with kinetic camerawork, chaotic vibe, frenetic editing and wicked character interplay.\n\nThe energy &amp; passion is evident in execution and the use of drones to film the chase sequences is undoubtedly inspiring but this would&apos;ve been an even better action-thriller if it was trimmed to a tight &amp; tense 90 mins ride. Jake Gyllenhaal, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II &amp; Eiza González remain in sync with the craziness on display. And while the interest &amp; momentum isn&apos;t lost, one does start to feel its 136 mins runtime in the remaining half.\n\nOverall, Ambulance is amusing, entertaining &amp; preposterous in all the ways a Michael Bay film is expected to be but it is also a whole lot of fast fun &amp; furious frivolity that manages to get plenty of mileage out of its barebone premise. The lack of restraint isn&apos;t an issue since it is one of the fine qualities of a Bayhem production but its overlong length does leave you feeling more exhausted than exhilarated in the end. In short, a gleeful &amp; enjoyable delight."

But a piece of mail from her sister who is in Colombia with a map to a rather large emerald, the Hitchcockian McGuffin of the film leads her on a high road to adventure the kind of thing she writes about. \n\nHer adventure in Colombia includes taking the wrong bus, being chased by a free wheeling army colonel, falling in the hands of drug dealers, pursued by bottom feeding crook Danny DeVito and finally partnering with the kind of adventure hero she writes about in Michael Douglas.\n\nDouglas and Turner would prove so popular that they did two other pictures in the 80s. The film itself got an Oscar nod for Editing.\n\nSome others in this gifted cast are Mary Ellen Trainor as her sister, Holland Taylor as Turner&apos;s editor, Alfonso Arau who is a drug dealer fan of her work, and Manuel Ojeda as the army colonel obsessed with that big green jewel.\n\nRomancing The Stone is a lushly photographed and vigorous satire on all those old action/adventure films.

      "reviewBody": "Being a Millennial, I can attest to our generation that it was a great time to be alive with &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot; being some of our favorite tween-age blow-up-knock-down action movies to go see with our friends in the theater 3 times in the same day, with campy yet lovable characters like Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Those were the days. I still enjoy watching those flicks from time to time - not just for the nostalgia. They are still quite entertaining in their own right.\n\nNow we have &quot;Moonfall&quot; some 25 years later. Cut from the same construction paper, but more like pieces of old scripts from Roland Emmerich&apos;s late &apos;90s writing room shredder taped together in hopes the characters and dialog would be usable in telling the grandiose destructo-type story instead of just talking props. Speaking of which, I give props to Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, and John Bradley (who actually had a solid character to go with his style) for trying, but it simply wasn&apos;t enough.\n\nI&apos;ve listened to commentaries and interviews with Emmerich and I personally think he doesn&apos;t have good instincts on how to put a balanced action film together since the mid 2000s (with the ID4 sequel, if you watch the deleted scenes cut what would&apos;ve been the best and most meaningful scenes of the entire movie) with the aim of just going big and loud, using any means whatsoever. It works...until it doesn&apos;t. Action fatigue sets in frequently in this and many of his recent past movies. It&apos;s alarming when I am physically incapable of caring less about the world ending than watching these characters attempt to get from beginning to end - in fact, there was no palpable peril despite the entire earth getting properly f&apos;ed up, we only see it in overhead shots of floods and earthquakes and meteorites (I think COVID may have had something to do with not being able to have scenes with dozens of extras on the ground clamoring over each other like in all other action flicks from the days of yore).\n\nHowever, the concept was intriguing and in my opinion, pretty great. It reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke&apos;s &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; but with the Moon instead of a floating cylinder in space. I really did enjoy watching the last 20-30 mins or so play out after an hour and a half of random skipping around characters trying to hatch the plan to get us to that point while trying to make the audience like and/or care. If the script had half the heart and good campiness of something like &quot;Independence Day&quot;, it definitely could have kicked my rating up a little.\n\nWait for streaming.",

The former feels like she was born to play the obnoxious overachiever while the latter embodies a disastrous midlife crisis that&apos;s just pure cringe (the guy is off-the-wall sleazy).\n\nMost of the humor is in the dialogue, but there are plenty of laughs in the comical freeze frames and aly editing. I didn&apos;t know what to make of this movie back in &apos;99, but this time around was thoroughly caught up in the dark humor. &quot;Election&quot; is sharp, witty and depraved in the most entertaining way.\n\nI can&apos;t speak highly enough of Witherspoon here; she is hysterical.",

Taking place on the same night as the original (October 31, 1978), Michael Myers has survived bullet wounds, and is out for more carnage! And of course, he makes another attempt to do away with Laurie Strode (the Jamie Lee Curtis character).\n\nThis sequel is a little more gruesome than the first Halloween movie. Part of the reason has to do with some of the methods Michael Myers uses to kill some of his victims: He drowns one victim in scalding water and he uses an IV to drain out the blood of another. In addition, there&apos;s a scene where a kid is admitted to the hospital because he is bleeding orally, which resulted from an obvious Halloween prank. (Ugh!)\n\nHere&apos;s an interesting piece of trivia: The Practice/Ally McBeal producer Jeffrey Kramer appears in this film. Look for him as the coroner examining a charred corpse."

      "reviewBody": "One would suspect that this film would offer the audience at least a fun experience and a decent amount of humor, but That Awkward Moment fails to deliver in every way. Not only does the film have a very predictable storyline and clichéd characters, it is also poorly paced and lacks any sort of momentum. The writing is weak and provides very few humorous moments, with the only encouraging aspect being the performance of Miles Teller, whose comedic talent does shine through. Overall, however, the three leading men lack any sort of chemistry, which results in disappointing delivery and causes the characters to be uninteresting. That Awkward Moment therefore fails to produce characters that are relatable on a emotional level, despite that being the film&apos;s main aim.",

      "name": "Strangely flat and lifeless. Depp should stay away from vanity projects",
      "reviewBody": "Johnny Depp&apos;s vanity project The Rum Diary - &apos;vanity project&apos; for that, at the end of the day is all it is - is based on a novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson Depp is said to have found among Thompson&apos;s belongings after the writer&apos;s suicide. The novel, completed in 1960 wasn&apos;t published until 1998 and, well, you have to ask yourself why. If the film of the novel is anything to go by I suspect it was simply because it wasn&apos;t very good. But as I have never read it, I can&apos;t tell you either way.\n\nMediocre novels have been turned into great films by great scriptwriters and directors. Unfortunately on this offering Bruce Robinson isn&apos;t one. Or if he is, he this is one occasion when he hasn&apos;t pulled it off. (Robinson made his name with his semi-autobiographical film Withnail &amp; I, and I have to admit that didn&apos;t do too much for me either.) Depp has previously dabbled in Thompson&apos;s work with Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. That didn&apos;t come off either, which suggests to me Depp has something of a blind spot where Thompson is concerned. And this is Robinson&apos;s first film as director in 19 years. That, too, should tell us something, and possibly something not particularly complimentary.\n\nThe film itself is oddly old-fashioned, in storyline, cinematography, direction and production. In the hands of another director Thompson&apos;s rather slight story might well have been turned to gold. Here it remains base metal. Almost everything about it, from the soundtrack to the dialogue, from the &apos;plot&apos; to the humour - it has been billed as a comedy - is flat and lifeless and, well, mediocre. This kind of schtick was churned out weekly by journeymen writers and directors until the digital age changed what the punter wanted to see. Depp, it has to be said (and this is a personal view) always has an attractive screen presence even when the film he&apos;s starring in is third-rate (and I have seen him in some real clunkers - Blow comes to mind).\n\nAmber Heard has virtually no role and I simply did not buy the romance between her character and Depp&apos;s. Michael Rispoli, Giovanni Ribisi, Aaron Eckhart and Richard Jenkins (who was excellent as the penny-counting hit-man&apos;s paymaster in Killing Them Softly) turn in workaday performances and do the best of a bad job given what little they had to work with. Situations which, I&apos;m sure, were intended to raise a laugh do nothing of the kind. I really did want to turn off halfway through but held out in case it somehow went from second to third gear. But it didn&apos;t.\n\nSorry, Johnny, perhaps you should get better advice and listen to others rather than your own gut.",

      "reviewBody": "I was hugely surprised at just how good the first film was and was tentatively cautious when this sequel was green-lighted that perhaps it might cheapen Michael Bond&apos;s beloved family friendly creation.\n\nHowever, fear not, for this sequel is absolutely terrific on all levels. Firstly it is as funny and witty and as brilliantly animated as the first film. The excellent cast from the first film is also enhanced by a superb turn from Hugh Grant, who hasn&apos;t been as good as he is here in a long time. In fact it is quite clear to the viewer that Grant is thoroughly enjoying himself by playing against type and sending himself up as a faded egotistical actor and total cad who sets Paddington up to be the fall guy (or should that be Bear?) for a dastardly deed. There is a touch of the pantomime villain to his performance, but it works splendidly and it fits his character perfectly.\n\nAll the wit and heart of the first film is still evident here and in some ways, built upon. Brendan Gleeson is also excellent as an old lag and prison cook who loses his angry nature when he succumbs to Paddington&apos;s charms and talents in the kitchen. There are also loads of great jokes too, some pitched at younger children and some deliberately aimed at the more adult viewer.\n\nAll in all this is a worthy sequel and a great memorial to Paddingtons creator, Michael Bond, who died whilst this sequel was still being filmed. It is full of laughs, thrills, action sequences, great characters, some wonderful animation (one scene is an obvious nod to the 2D paper cut-outs of the human characters in the 1970s children&apos;s TV show) and you would have to have a hard heart indeed to not burst into tears at the wonderful ending. Also, don&apos;t leave the film until you watch Hugh Grant gloriously send himself up with a musical song and dance act as the end credits roll. \n\nThoroughly recommended to anybody who wants to see 100 minutes of family friendly fun that isn&apos;t either sickly sweet or too dark for youngsters and still thoroughly watchable to adults too. Great fun and a worthy sequel to one of the best British films in recent years.",

      "reviewBody": "The Wind Rises is a fictionalized biography / character study of Jiro Hirikoshi and his story of becoming an Aviation Engineer. This movie had a great impact on me after seeing it in the theatre and I thought about what I had seen for the one hour drive home afterwards. In terms of pacing and how the movie focuses on the main character I was reminded of David Lean movies in its maturity and emotional grit. There were also times when watching that I thought to myself I have never seen hand drawn animation this good ever and will probably never see animation this good ever again. The character designs are beautiful. The backgrounds and color pallete are beautiful. The animation is breathtaking. But the story is just as beautiful as the artwork. The movie is about one mans journey to make beautiful airplanes but is also equally tragic in later scenes of the movie in the evolving love story and especially the last scene in the movie.\n\nThis movie does not explain at any time through dialogue what the character is feeling but instead it shows you and the subtle and at times powerful emotions which are the glue of what holds his story together. Some people may wonder why Miyazaki took creative risks with the real life story of Jiro Hirikoshi. The real life Jiro never married to a woman with Tuberculosis. Did he really fantasize about building airplanes? Was he really followed by a Soviet Spy? I think the way the character fantasizes about airplanes even when not dreaming is an honest depiction of how creative people like Hayao Miyazaki think.\n\nAlong with Porco Rosso this is probably Hayao Miyazaki&apos;s most personal movie. If you study Hayao Miyazaki&apos;s movies and read about his career like I have it becomes obvious that this movie is as much about Jiro Hirikoshi as it is about Hayao Miyazaki.\n\nI recommend anyone who has ever been creative to go see the Wind Rises.\n\nHayao Miyazaki&apos;s Most Beautiful film.",

      "reviewBody": "There has been a lot of talk that &quot;Broken Flowers&quot; is Jim Jarmusch&apos;s most commercially accessible film to date. One can almost hear Jarmusch muttering something reactionary like &quot;commercial? That&apos;s just a label.&quot; It&apos;s a label that some Jarmusch fans might associate with &quot;selling out&quot;. But selling out does not apply to Jim Jarmusch. He still has complete control of his work and is still the only American filmmaker who owns his own negatives. If &quot;Broken Flowers&quot; does break into the mainstream, it is nothing overly deliberate. Jarmusch makes familiar films that seem intimate in their tone. He toys with old themes while still leaving his films open to interpretation. \n\n&quot;Broken Flowers&quot; is a travelogue and like most Jarmusch films, the story is more concerned with the journey but not so much about the destination. Bill Murray plays Don Johnston, a man who we know little about. We know he&apos;s single and we know he&apos;s had some flame&apos;s in the past. The last one just walked out on him. When Don receives an anonymous letter from one of these old flames, he learns that he has a twenty year old son who might be looking for him.&quot; Don thinks this is a joke but takes the advice from a friend to unfold the mystery by tracking down his past flings. He flies somewhere to a generic American place, rents a car and begins his investigation. Each ex has an individual personality but most of them share something similar. They are content and have moved on from the past. One of the ex&apos;s we meet works in real estate and decides it would be a good idea for her to get into the water business because &quot;one day in the near future it will be more valuable then oil.&quot; The atmosphere is awkward and rather then care whether this woman is responsible for the anonymous letter, we just feel like getting out of there. The film&apos;s journey is absurd in many ways because we are never sure what the real point is. What is Don going to do if he does find his son? This where Bill Murray&apos;s credit as an actor shines through. We see from his small facial gestures that he is empty, and sad. There is a sense of longing as if life took a wrong turn somewhere and it is only now that he is realizing it. The ending of &quot;Broken Flowers&quot; is what really makes the film special. Don&apos;t expect too much or too little. Just see it. Its inspiring, hopeful and better then any other movie this year. The film also has a great soundtrack by Ethiopian musician, Mulatu Astatke. And we see in the credits that Jarmusch dedicated the film to French filmmaker Jean Eustache. Jean Eustache made a phenomenal film in the 1960&apos;s titled, &quot;The Mother and The Whore&quot;. He had an influence on John Cassavetes and likewise both had an influence on Jim Jarmusch.",

      "name": "Really fun dumb thriller",
      "reviewBody": "Cellular is a tightly paced thriller rife with a lot of dumb conveniences that just work in the execution of it all, making it very easy to get invested in. It&apos;s 94 minutes of escalating problems that keeps everything on its toes and has the right amount of characters in the mix so it can juggle a lot of different elements to maintain a high energy. It&apos;s a testament to screenwriter Chris Morgan&apos;s talents for writing satisfyingly dumb movies.\n\nChris Evans comfortably rises to the task and remains likeable throughout as he tries his best to save the day, eschewing the early cynicism quickly. Kim Basinger gives the best performance by spending a lot of time in a panicked state without losing her urgency and William H. Macy is the unexpected MVP. Jason Statham gets to play the villain in a nice change of pace even if the role is so generic it could literally be anyone else.\n\nDavid R. Ellis&apos; direction has plenty of early 2000s stylings and brings a lot of dynamism to proceedings in a way that stands out more now. There&apos;s a couple of intense car chases, clever switch ups and tense shootouts that ensure this is always a blast. The humour is less successful but it&apos;s still mostly well implemented and the score by John Ottman has all the required bombast to really sell the high stakes.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is about an elderly female music teacher and her husband, whose life gets torn apart by her stroke.\n\n&quot;Amour&quot; is a powerful portrayal of two individuals coping with vascular dementia. We see Mrs Laurent transforming from the graceful lady to a person completely unrecognisable at the end. The husband loves her and cares for her patiently and demanding nothing in return. It is the ultimate love that people long for. The performances of them are superb, especially Mrs Laurent. I was so surprised and impressed that she could even play lower facial nerve palsy (speaking only with one side of the mouth).\n\nIt is a superb film, with amazing performances and an unnerving story. However, I could not get into the film. Maybe it is because of the barren nature of the film. The minimalistic nature of the sets and soundtracks echoes the fading of Mrs Laurent. Or maybe it is just too raw and too threatening to think that this could be our future, that my unconscious mind rejects the content of the film."

He is great at creating interesting relationships between heroes and villains, and this film is a good example.\n\nJohn Travolta is terrific.  Christian Slater breaks typecast by playing a nice, sane soldier doing his duty.  The love interest isn&apos;t an idiotic supermodel playing a nuclear scientist or something, but a park ranger, also doing her duty.  She is cute, earthy, and actually believable.\n\nIf you want a film that will repeat every aspect of every other military adventure film you have ever seen, you will be disappointed.  If dialog bores you, skip this film.  If you like action movies filmed entirely in parking garages and spooky allies, then you will not appreciate the settings in this film in America&apos;s majestic West.",

The plot looks quite interesting as it tells the story of jealous, backstabbing models. Then, the story is interspersed between many visually stunning but purposeless scenes. The ending of the film becomes really bizarre, I got so lost and just could not believe what I was watching. I don&apos;t even know what the second half of the film is about, except that it wants to be very provocative. If the film could be consistently like the first half, I would actually have liked it."

      "reviewBody": "The film&apos;s plot is just how it is presented, so I will just focus on where the film fell short despite all the ingredients for success.\n\nI saw the trailer for this and was hoping for a good, not great, summer comedy. The quality of writing in this genre can be difficult to predict based on trailers because we see two minutes of footage trying to bring us to the theater, which often leaves the best jokes spoiled before the first minute. The main reason I chose to watch 30 Minutes or Less was because of Jesse Eisenburg. Coming off of his solid performance in The Social Network and his previous roles in comedy, surely he is in a position to wait for a good script.\n\nThere is a good cast here of actors who have had supporting roles or just a brief scene in big comedies over the past few years (Aziz Ansari and Nick Swardson in particular), who outside the comedy circuit aren&apos;t recognizable names yet. Danny McBride is getting perfect at playing this kind of character (the drug dealer in Observe and Report comes to mind) who projects the pure alpha male ego and aggression of someone of authority - all while misusing every quote, saying and fact considered to be common knowledge.\n\nI just erased a long analysis of my gripes, which aren&apos;t necessary to explain in such detail. The script was just flawed for comedy in my eyes and no one could save it. Mainly, the movie went back and forth between crazy but theoretically possible and not trying at all to seem believable. The characters are sometimes exaggerated kinds of people that exist and those who cannot, and with whom no one could relate to. Good comedies require more than lots of good jokes and actors. It all must come together in some way that works on the level presented, because context is what humor plays off. The best jokes of the film could be put essentially anywhere in any film and work the same.",

All one dimensional hillbillies. The acting? Awful.\n\nThe plot? Yeah right. This movie is great because you can&apos;t take\n\nyour eyes away. What cheesy line comes next? When&apos;s the next\n\nfight? And Who&apos;s the hot blonde? A guilty pleasure through and\n\nthrough but it is fun sitting around with a bunch of guys watching\n\nthis and laughing your ass off.

      "reviewBody": "Great subject but, strangely, unengaging movie.\n\nThe story of Muhammad Ali, one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, boxers who has ever lived. Shows from his first title bout (as Cassius Clay) until the conclusion of the &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; versus George Foreman. Covers his conversion to Islam, his relationships, his being drafted into the Army and his refusal to go, his subsequent legal issues and a myriad of other details.\n\nInteresting, from an historical perspective, but feels flat and unengaging as a human drama. On paper it should work - the movie is directed by Michael Mann, of Heat, Collateral, Public Enemies, The Last of the Mohicans and Miami Vice fame. However, he is more an action-drama / thriller director and it shows, to a degree, in this movie. Characters aren&apos;t developed very well but the action scenes (in this case, the fight scenes) are great.\n\nPart of the problem is that Mann tries to cram as many events from Ali&apos;s life into the movie as possible. Even though the movie is fairly long at 2 1/2 hours, many of the lesser events are given a passing mention, with no real context. You often feel no connection to the event and they just feel like flashes across the screen.\n\nA better way to tackle the subject would have been to concentrate on the big themes and events of Ali&apos;s life, and leave out all the miscellaneous life. This, or make a mini-series rather than a movie. The man did and achieved so much, 2 1/2 hours is hardly enough time to encapsulate his life.\n\nOn the plus side, as mentioned before the fight scenes are great. Well staged, well shot and very tense.\n\nWill Smith got a Best Leading Actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Ali, but I am not sure he deserved it. Physically he is not imposing enough to be Ali. Furthermore, while he does a great job at capturing Ali&apos;s bravado and trash-talking, his verbal tone just doesn&apos;t seem right in normal speech. It&apos;s as if every line of dialogue is a speech, rather than just normal dialogue, and this can be quite irritating at times.\n\nGood supporting cast though. Jon Voight is almost unrecognizable as legendary sports presenter, and Ali&apos;s verbal sparring partner, Howard Cosell. He does a great job and got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts.\n\nGood work too from Jamie Foxx. The hidden gem is Mykelti Williamson who gives a great, over-the-top, often-hilarious performance as boxing promoter Don King.\n\nOverall, considering the subject, this movie is disappointing but there is enough there to keep you interested.",

      "reviewBody": "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps isn&apos;t the sharp, critical film that its makers want you to think of it as. The sequel to the supremely influential, endlessly quotable original from the 80&apos;s is a dull whimper about what triggered the present financial meltdown and though it&apos;s cut from the same cloth as the original, it possess all of the bark yet, sadly, none of the bite.\n\nGordon Gekko is a name that defined an era. Played by Michael Douglas twenty three years ago, he reverberated in the minds of viewers as a ruthless, amoral investor without a soul. Years later, the sequel finds him released after serving his prison sentence. Cut to seven years after his release, and its 2008, the dawn of the financial crisis. Gekko is now known as a speaker publicly vilifying the notion of greed in corporate America while simultaneously, and some would reckon quite ironically, publicizing his book inspiringly titled &quot;Is Greed Good&quot;. A loner who travels in subways, he is estranged from his daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan, androgynously unglamorous) who is engaged to a young trader named Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf). Jake bumps into Gekko at one of his speeches (the films finest scene) and the two form a mentor-protégé relationship that irks Winnie but allows Jake to benefit by plotting revenge from Bretton James (Josh Brolin, the films principle villain), suspected of being responsible for the suicide of Louis Zabel, a close friend and confidant of Jake.\n\nIf the film sounds like a mess of relationships, then it is. As muddled as Stone&apos;s own political activism it has no clarity on what its trying to say. From trying to rationalize the reasons behind the market crash to the impulsive nature of human behaviour, it doesn&apos;t get either right. Not helping are the actors that Stone assembles. It&apos;s a mystery to me why Shia LaBeouf is constantly being thrust down viewer throats in film after film by studios convinced he is the next best thing. He is not, and despite being dressed up in expensive designer garb, cannot pass off as being anything more convincing than a working intern. His relationship with Gekko has none of the enticing quality that Charlie Sheen&apos;s Bud Fox did and a cameo appearance by Sheen only underscores this disparity. Douglas himself has none of the limelight. He has some powerful lines, but feels largely sidelined by the revenge/relationship/murder subplots and behaves uncharacteristically, especially in the very last scene (these were probably added as an afterthought). After showing some promise of returning to his incendiary, often infuriating filmmaking style and point of view with his previous film W, director Stone seems to have gone back to being comfortable working with drab studio approved material.\n\nNot only was the original Wall Street a tremendously entertaining film, but one that was blessed with the critical foresight of its maker. The sequel partially entertains but does not have a new perspective. It is neither critical nor insightful and could have, with the same script and actors, been the work of a lesser director than Stone. The films themes are also impersonal - none of the characters suffer directly from the financial crisis the way they did in the original, they suffer from their own incompetent decision making, a sharp departure from how the original handled and fused stock trading with personal loss and gain.",

Well I&apos;d advise them to look beyond Hollywood and they&apos;ll find plenty of movies that are different and GOOD. Why opt for something crappy just because you want something else? Others seem to find layers in the film that to me were non-existent. &apos;Funny Games U.S.&apos; is pretentious garbage and the ONLY good things about it are Naomi Watts and child actor Devon Gearhart. Both deliver very natural performances and are the only people you care about on screen. Watts&apos;s name was the main thing that convinced me to watch this. Incredibly gifted actress that she is, I liked every single one of her films that I saw until now. What made her choose this film? Anyway, &apos;Funny Games U.S.&apos; is a pure waste of time."

      "reviewBody": "Runaway Bride is just a good romantic comedy. Yes, the director and the two big name stars are the same as the film&apos;s 1990 counterpart, but even though the two films have striking and almost offensive similarities, Runaway Bride has a good enough story that I refuse to believe that it relied on the success of its predecessor. \n\nJulia Roberts is Maggie Carpenter, a hardware store owner (a laughable profession surpassed only by Denise Richards as a nuclear weapons specialist in The World Is Not Enough. Yeah RIGHT!), and Richard Gere is a newspaper columnist (Ike Graham) who has been fired for printing a supposedly false column about a woman who consistently runs out on her marriages. When he travels to the tiny town where she lives to learn more about her life and possibly get his job back, he finds that there is more to her than just a newspaper column. \n\nBy the end of the film, there is such a huge media hype about Maggie&apos;s wedding that it&apos;s a wonder that Ike wasn&apos;t honored for his &apos;false&apos; column about her. Joan Cusack has never looked and acted better than she did in this movie, delivering a wonderful nasally performance that was strangely heartwarming. \n\nRunaway Bride had all kinds of wonderful scenes. I particularly liked the wedding rehearsal scene. The look on Christopher Meloni&apos;s face was priceless! There were so many good things about this film that I am able to overlook the superficial look of unoriginality. If you just look past the director and the two big names, the story itself is not at all like any other film. There will, of course, be the inevitable cynical comparisons to Pretty Woman, and these complaints are understandable, but people who condemn Runaway Bride as a rip-off of Pretty Woman or some sort of re-make are simply not looking at the film, but only at the names on the bill. This is a very good romantic comedy, and it should not be missed simply because of a superficial comparison to Pretty Woman.",

      "reviewBody": "With three of his novels being adapted into critically acclaimed films, Cormac McCarthy has opted to try his hand at screen writing, and the fruits of his labor can be seen in The Counselor. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film stars Michael Fassbender as a high-priced lawyer who decides to dabble in something a bit less than legal in order to make some extra cash.\n\nAgainst the advice of associates Reiner (Javier Bardem) and Westray (Brad Pitt), The Counselor (whose name is never mentioned) has somehow gotten himself involved in the drug trafficking business, although the film remains ambiguous about the specifics. Motivated by the love of a beautiful woman (Penelope Cruz) and the desire to maintain the lifestyle he&apos;s enjoyed for so long, he never takes into account the sort of consequences he may be subjected to, should things not go according to plan.\n\nAs the trailers for the film make abundantly clear, things do not, in fact, go according to plan - at least, that&apos;s what we&apos;re led to believe, since the details of The Counselor&apos;s involvement in said plan are never actually revealed. Despite being warned about this scenario from the very beginning, by nearly every other character in the film, The Counselor remains inexplicably shocked and stunned when things begin to unravel.\n\nRidley Scott&apos;s latest directorial effort is peppered with lengthy scenes that find The Counselor engaged in conversations with other characters as they try to impart kernels of wisdom, truth and philosophy. Unfortunately, first-time screenwriter McCarthy fails to realize that he&apos;s not writing a novel here. Despite the brilliance of his literary works, he doesn&apos;t take into account the fact that living, breathing people rarely speak in monologues, and there&apos;s scarcely an ounce of naturally delivered dialogue in any of these exchanges.\n\nIndeed, if you watch closely you can actually see the actors struggling to wrap their heads (and mouths) around these complex conversations that are surely meant to sound intelligent, but come across as anything but. It&apos;s hard to find fault with the talented cast, but when working with such messy material, it&apos;s difficult to be at the top of your game.\n\nDespite the script&apos;s shortcomings, The Counselor provides enough intrigue to keep things moving along for about 90 minutes or so. The problem, of course, is that the film grinds to a complete and utter halt with another half hour still left in the tank, and the final 30 minutes is some of the most excruciatingly boring cinema I&apos;ve seen this year. It&apos;s a frustrating and befuddling experience, and I left the theater wondering exactly what the hell had happened, both in front of the camera and behind it.\n\n-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com",

      "reviewBody": "As classroom dramas go this may well be one the finest I have ever seen. A compelling insight into Americas failing education system and the beleaguered teachers that inhabit it.\n\nThe story centres around Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher who spends three weeks at a high school where the students are as troubled as their teachers. Barthes, portrayed brilliantly by Adrien Brody, finds himself surrounded by individuals who have become jaded to the point of breaking. \n\nHis tale becomes even more complex when a chance encounter with a teenage prostitute, Erica, develops into an unconventional friendship. It&apos;s within this custodial dynamic that we see some of the films most poignant and heartbreaking moments, as well as some outstanding acting from Sami Gayle, who plays the vulnerable young girl that society has abandoned. \n\nThe film employs a three part cutaway technique with Henry Barthes providing a narrative in the form an interview, as well as flashbacks to his childhood - which allows us an insight into why he such a brooding and melancholic character. The flashbacks are often juxtaposed with scenes involving Barthes grandfather with whom he visits in hospital through out the film. The third cutaway is an animated chalkboard sequence which I felt conveyed a sense of culpability and lost innocence.\n\nThe film also boasts an extraordinary supporting cast; including James Caan, Marcia Gay Harden and a very brief appearance from Bryan Cranston, as well as a surprisingly fine turn from Lucy Liu- the schools doctor. The staffs sense of disillusionment and frustration, due to the students perpetual indifference to their own fate, is vented brilliantly by Liu in a scene that begs the question; &quot;where, and when, did it all go wrong?&quot; \n\nThough dealing with very bleak subjects and despite the characters ceaseless sense of defeat and abject loathing for their profession, there are still some heart warming moments in the film. And though it offers no suggestion as to how we can amend such failings in our education system, and that parenting has in so many avenues of society become bereft of any moral guidance and adequacy, it still left me reassured that there are those who are still prepared to undertake such a daunting and thankless task.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for an entertaining piece then I suggest you look elsewhere, but if you wish to see a brilliantly thought provoking film that raises more questions than it provides answers, and you&apos;re prepared for some uncomfortable moments, then you&apos;ll be rewarded with a film that is excellently written and directed and has some outstanding performances. A great film!",

His one weak area in this film was editing. There is no reason this movie couldn&apos;t have been half an hour shorter. Right off the bat, there were unnecessarily lingering camera shots and scenes that could have omitted. Off the top of my head, I&apos;m thinking of Spike himself sliding under a woman&apos;s skirt and mugging the camera. That scene not only failed to further the story but instead made the audience stand up and say, &quot;Hey, that&apos;s Spike looking at us!&quot; Lee&apos;s biggest editing mistake was based on his desire to tell the story of Malcolm X AND tell the story of the African-American experience. That&apos;s more than enough for several movies so why cram it all under one title? After a clear scene illustrating X&apos;s life, Lee would move to a large dance hall to illustrate the richness of the African-American experience. A quick shot of the dance hall would have been sufficient. Instead the far away shots were maintained for too long and when the focus moved back to specific characters it moved to the character played by Lee himself. Why? I don&apos;t know. It certainly didn&apos;t help us to understand X any better. The ending with children saying &quot;I am Malcolm X&quot; also went on too long and should have been part of a separate feature. The cameos were distracting. The movie could have been tighter, shorter, and better except that Spike Lee wanted to put everything, including the kitchen sink, into it.\n\nThat being said, it is a great movie and I&apos;m glad I invested the three and a half hours to watch it.",

The story and the pacing are uneven here, with the film getting off to a slightly slow start and feeling rushed in other places, though you do have to admire the energy there is. There are plenty of fun parts with the second half far more compelling than the first and the film rarely has a dull moment, but structurally it is on the thin side and content-wise it feels overstuffed. However, if you want lots of colour, catchy music, fun and good characters and voice acting, Rio 2 very like its predecessor doesn&apos;t disappoint. The animation is amazing with lots of vibrant detail especially in the backgrounds and nothing looks hurried or static. The colours are even more brighter and colourful than the first film too. The music has that Brazilian flavour and the songs are incredibly catchy. Don&apos;t Go Away is a very touching song, but the highlights are the pizazz-personified Poisonous Love and the hilarious rap version of I Will Survive(thought I&apos;d never say this, can&apos;t stand rap on the most part). While the film does feel overstuffed, the content is actually really good, dialogue-wise it&apos;s smartly written and has a fair amount of heart while the gags provide plenty of laughs with sharp timing, the best being the soccer match, the jungle auditions and any scene(the Romeo and Juliet part in particular) with Gabi and Nigel. The characters are still engaging, Blu and Jewel are likable lead characters though they had more to do in the first one and Nigel has that menacing streak but is a riot. There are some great new characters as well, with Gabi as good a character as and in some cases even better the original ones. The voice acting adds to that, Jemaine Clement and Kristen Chenoweth are both phenomenal helped by that they have the film&apos;s best moments, though Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, Andy Garcia and everybody else acquit themselves more than fine too. To conclude, a good sequel to a great original, enjoyed it a lot and when it comes to animated sequels there is definitely much worse(ie. Secret of NIMH 2). 7/10 Bethany Cox",

That is one way to read it, but it would be putting meaning in there that probably was never intended.\n\nThis is quite simply someone with mental issues going after another person. It has a bit of a morality tale in there, scaring men off of cheating. But there is not much in it about gender. It simple works better as a psychotic woman rather than a man, because a psychotic man with a knife is pretty mundane.",

I had no expectations going into the film so was astounded that I had missed this movie at all. It&apos;s a gripping father and son tale, and it is also an underdog story. I even shed a tear at the finale of this wonderful tale. This movie appeals to all ages. The only reason I give it a 9 out of 10 is that it slows down a little in the middle, but it comes back strong in the end. The acting was great, the story was magnificent, and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film. GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Rent it, buy it, watch it, LOVE IT! I know I did!",

And it&apos;s cool to see what blockbuster director Peter Jackson enjoys and did back in the day.\n\nThis film is really quite disgusting, however, it should not be taken seriously!

It made me think again about everything I&apos;ve always believed, and challenged me to think beyond the obvious. \n\nAlthough I haven&apos;t read the book, clearly this is an original story by John Irving, and more sentimental than I would expect from him. \n\nNote: Not appropriate for children under 14, many friends of mine have said it should have been rated R."

Leading lady Cecilia Roth is sensational as the mourning mother and the rest of the cast isn&apos;t any worse.The supporting roles by Penelope Cruz,Marise Paredes and especially Antonia San Juan are great.San Juan is a real time transvestite which makes it even more realistic. Almodovar caused quite a commotion with this provocative film although it never goes over the line(at least not in my taste)but you should not be old fashioned or truly religious because then it will offend you.\n\nThe humor that is put in the film makes it an even better experience.The mixture of intense drama and comedy is perfect.Another brilliant addition is the great soundtrack.The mixture between harmonic classical pieces and jazzy compositions is magnificent.\n\nI can&apos;t wait to see more of Almodovar&apos;s work. 9/10 (currently number 39 in my all time top 100 list)",

I felt very moved and intrigued both by the premise and the complications to move the story along.\n\nBig but: The lead character, Calvin, is not believable as a &quot;genius novelist&quot; nor even as a pretty good one. Why? He has no idea how to make Ruby, whom he completely controls, subtle and complex the way any good novelist would his characters.\n\nHe paints her happy and sad, joyful and childishly clinging with such broad brush strokes he is an incompetent &quot;inventor&quot; of a character/person, let alone his dream girl. If you or I created an automaton, WE might swing back and forth to the extremes while trying to adjust his/her behavior. Calvin should be an expert not a tyro at subtle shades of behavior. Granted, if he got her just right, we would have no crisis to force the story to a resolution.\n\nAnd the resolution is Hollywood sugar. In Europe or Israel, the hero would be left with the sad results of his failure. (He stares out to sea on a deserted beach to ponder what happened and his bleak future?) Here, the filmmakers insist we leave the theater feeling good about Calvin and Ruby.",

It&apos;s a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.\n\nThe concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn&apos;t be saved due to it&apos;s terrible execution. &quot;Madame Web&quot; simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.\n\nThere is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn&apos;t redeem the fact that the movie is bad.\n\nSo yeah...&quot;Madame Web&quot; is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony&apos;s Spider-Less universe. It&apos;s like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget.

With it&apos;s very complex story, this one will even leave some adults scratching their head after they see it. That&apos;s because there are many interpretations for this movie. Which make it a somewhat difficult experience.\n\nStill a good one, but difficult to wrap your mind around it ... The story mind you, never get&apos;s out of hand or get&apos;s out of hand (in the sense, that it does make ... sense, in the end). If you&apos;re ready for a mind trip, this sure will be a great one to take/experience!",

    "summary": "Reviewers say 'Jawan' offers strong performances, especially from Shahrukh Khan, and thrilling action scenes. It tackles social issues like corruption and justice, drawing inspiration from 'Money Heist'. However, it is criticized for its derivative plot, pacing problems, and lack of originality. The second half is seen as weaker, with a convoluted story and underdeveloped characters. The music and songs receive mixed feedback. Despite flaws, many commend its fusion of Bollywood and South Indian cinema styles.",

The fights were engaging, little humor everywhere created very good atmosphere.\n\nAfter watching Pathaan where they had a very dull climax, I wasn&apos;t hyped a lot for this movie, hell barely saw the trailer but entering the cinema my views changed. Flying start, story was somewhat new but also had a lot of inspiration from previous series like Money Heist.\n\nSomeone who never hates on South Indian style action, this movie provides just that but with a high budget which you can see throughout the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Kabir Khan triumphs with a yet another winner with &apos;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&apos;. Khan delivers a film thats heartwarming, emotional &amp; extremely entertaining. And Salman is exceptional, delivering his finest performance to date in the title role. \n\n&apos;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&apos; Synopsis: A young mute girl from Pakistan loses herself in India with no way to head back. A devoted man with a magnanimous spirit undertakes the task to get her back to her motherland and unite her with her family.\n\n&apos;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&apos; is a heartwarming tale about love &amp; unity. Though a subtle father-daughter story at heart, the film is also an effective commentary on the India-Pakistan conflict/relationship, that exists even today. The narrative beautifully makes space for humour, strong emotions &amp; also poignant drama. \n\nWhile the first-hour, set in India warms up, with defining its characters &amp; shifting between songs, its the second-hour that takes &apos;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&apos; to the epitome. The story shifts to Pakistan &amp; the series of events that follow with its endearing protagonist &amp; the child, are undeniably engaging &amp; moving. And the climax, though slightly melodramatic, that too leaves an impact. \n\nKhan, V. Vijayendra Prasad, Parveez Shaikh &amp; Asad Hussai&apos;s Screenplay is excellent. It very believably blends many emotions &amp; also courageously comments on the long-lasting topic of India-Pakistan. But its done effectively. Barring the slightly under-whelming climax, the Writing is consistently engaging otherwise. Khan&apos;s Direction is top-notch. He has handled the film with skill. Aseem Mishra&apos;s Cinematography captures the Stunning Locales of Kashmir, superbly. Editing is mostly crisp, although the film runs for over a 155-minutes. Music by Various Artists is lovely. Art &amp; Costume Design are satisfactory. \n\nPerformance-Wise: Salman is at his best here. As Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi Bhaijaan, the Superstar enacts the god-loving, clean-hearted soul, with excellence. He&apos;s restrained, affecting &amp; absolutely lovable, proving once again that he&apos;s much more than a box-offer thunder. He&apos;s the soul of &apos;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&apos;. Child Artiste Harshaali Malhotra is adorable. Her on-screen chemistry with Salman, melts your heart. Kareena Kapoor Khan is charming in a brief, yet substantial role. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is top-notch, yet again! He brings the house down with his brilliant comic-timing &amp; walks away with some of the film&apos;s best moments, as well. Om Puri shines in a cameo. Sharat Saxena is good. Others lend fair support.\n\nOn the whole, &apos;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&apos; has its heart &amp; soul at the right place. It wins you over completely, with its heart touching story. Strongly Recommended!",

His gang is killed and he is burned to a cinder when stealing two million dollars from a ruthless gangster Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry) who is also running for political office. He is running against smarmy upstart Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell) who is corrupt just like his father Tom Mulligan (Robert Duvall) who is stepping down from politics due to ill health.\n\nJamal and his brother Jatemme Manning (Daniel Kaluuya) put pressure on Harry&apos;s widow Veronica (Viola Davis) to liquidate all her assets and pay them back.\n\nHarry has left behind a notebook with plans for his next job. Veronica teams up with the other widows from her late husband&apos;s gang to pull off the heist and pay off the Mannings. The Mannings are after the notebook as well.\n\nSteve McQueen has gone for a muscular reworking set in Chicago but it also becomes flabby with too many right on messages ranging from political corruption, female exploitation to a racist cop needlessly killing a young black man. The political angle was overkill and got in the way of the main story, at times making the widows secondary characters in their own movie.\n\nHaving seen the original series of Widows when it was broadcast. It was a trailblazer, a heist film featuring women and written by a woman with a big plot twist. The remake maintains the twist but is nowhere as good as the original show.",

I plan on watching it again with the director&apos;s commentary and then again in chronological order.\n\nI rented this movie because of my fascination of Christopher Nolan&apos;s more recent movie Memento. Following has some similarities; this movie was probably the blueprint for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar.\n\nShooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. The story and dialogue is really good. The performance of the actors is believable.\n\nChristopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget. I look forward to his next release Insomnia, a big budget movie with my favourite actor Al Pacino.",

      "reviewBody": "THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES (Walter Salles - Argentina/Chile/France/Germany/UK/USA 2004).\n\nFrom the director who unleashed the Oscar-nominated CENTRAL DO BRASIL (1998) on the world and is now torturing audiences around the world with Paris JE T&apos;AIME (a joint-project with some other world-weary humanist directors), a film unlikely to increase Paris&apos; appeal. The film seems conveniently marketed for the anti-globalist soul-searching urbanites in Europe. It will probably keep them quiet for a while, since &apos;having seen this film&apos; undoubtedly cleansed many souls.\n\nThe film&apos;s first hour is spent in the extreme southern corners of the continent, in Patagonia, which plays more like a National Geographic episode with some laughably awful dramatics in between. Some time is spent in central Chile and by the 57 minute we arrive in Peru. They use a shot of exactly the same mountain in exactly the same angle (prabably very consciously done) as in AGUIRRE: DER ZORN GOTTES by Werner Herzog, near the ruins of Machu Picchu. This was one of the worst parts of the film, where our infallible heroes engage in some embarrassing chit chat, and - en passant - blame colonialism, Catholicism and modern capitalism for all misery, while talking to some local Incan descendants about how they&apos;re gonna put an end to poverty in the world.\n\nDirector Walter Salles has an indestructible believe in the goodness of mankind. I do not share this view, but such a perspective shouldn&apos;t be a barrier upfront for making a decent film. Salles, however, shows our hero as a completely one-note morally unambiguous robot. He is like a God to him. He seems to lack any questioning about his morals or world view. His view is already established at a young age and now the world has to adapt to his insights, and to this film, which does nothing but play lip-service to these, which results in even more suffering for the audience. All political views aside, the film doesn&apos;t offer the slightest assault of the senses, with two incredibly uninteresting characters. The film is largely made to tell the story of Che Guevara, or perhaps show us the diversity of South-American culture and its people, but the film&apos;s observations are alarmingly clichéd, contrived and repetitive.\n\nCamera Obscura --- 0/10"

    "summary": "Reviewers say 'The Brutalist' is a visually stunning film with ambitious themes of immigration and artistic integrity. Adrien Brody's performance is highly praised, though the slow pacing and emotionally detached storytelling receive criticism. The use of AI in accents and set design sparks debate. Themes of antisemitism and the immigrant experience are highlighted, along with the symbolic use of brutalist architecture. Performances by Brody, Pearce, and Jones are commended, but the film's epic scale and narrative execution are divisive.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Brutalist,&quot; much like the architectural style it&apos;s named after, is imposing, cold, and ultimately, quite boring. This film, which chronicles the decades-spanning career of an ambitious architect, aims for epic grandeur but instead delivers a bloated and convoluted narrative that collapses under its own weight.\n\nWhile the film boasts a striking visual style, meticulously recreating period details and crafting impressive architectural set pieces, this commitment to aesthetic flourishes comes at the expense of a compelling story. We are presented with a series of loosely connected vignettes, each more ponderous than the last, detailing the triumphs and tribulations of a man more cipher than character.\n\nThe film&apos;s central problem is its length. Clocking in far too long, &quot;Brutalist&quot; feels like a never-ending tour of a building you&apos;ve already seen every corner of. The complicated, multi-stranded plot, only adds to the confusion, leaving the audience struggling to piece together a narrative that feels unnecessarily fragmented.\n\nUltimately, &quot;Brutalist&quot; is a classic case of style over substance. It&apos;s a film that clearly prioritizes visual spectacle over emotional resonance, leaving the viewer feeling impressed but ultimately detached. It&apos;s a beautifully constructed edifice with nothing inside, a testament to the fact that even the most impressive facade can&apos;t mask a hollow core. This film is less a moving story and more an endurance test, a stark reminder that bigger isn&apos;t always better, and that sometimes, less is truly more. Save your time and admire a well-designed building instead."

I&apos;ve tried reading some of Clive Cussler&apos;s books, but not exactly my style, but both movies based on his material (Sahara and Raise the Titanic) are decent enough movies with this one being the better of the two (and apart from the news article regarding the Titanic during the opening credits you wouldn&apos;t know it was connected). Dirk Pitt is portrayed wildly different in both movies with this one being more action and humor oriented.\n\nMovie is easy enough to find and watch for free on streaming services so if you have a Roku just do a search for it. If it isn&apos;t available when you do search for it, sit tight, it will make another round of availability soon enough. Definitely worth it if you&apos;re looking for an action/adventure style buddy movie with humor.",

      "reviewBody": "`Candyman&apos; is a very frightening and yet intriguing and compelling movie that plays upon and cleverly manipulates old urban legends and myths of folklore and brings to life some of your worst nightmares and horrors. As far as scary movies go it falls into a category of its own in terms of its depth and excellence\n\nOne of the main strengths of this movie is that the script and the character performances are so powerful and credible that it doesn&apos;t feel the need to inject unnecessary horror/graphic/violent scenes into it to sensationalize it. Sure, there is an extensive amount of blood and gore in the movie but it nevertheless fits in with the plot and isn&apos;t added in just to give the film an unnecessary `horror&apos; feel. The chilling and terrifying aspects of this movie come from the dialogue, the sequence of events and the emotions and personas revealed in the characters. The plot and the script is enough to leave you mesmerized throughout the whole movie and to remain on the edge of your seat with the anticipation of what is going to happen next. The producers and scriptwriters must receive top marks for the wonderful way in which they enriched the whole movie by relying on the script and the acting instead of adding cheap gimmicks into it to make it more frightening. In addition to that the lighting and the scenery around the whole movie makes it even more frightening\n\nI have always thought Virginia Madsen to be a highly talented, qualified and excellent actress whose wonderful acting and gifted performances have been consistently overlooked when allocating movie roles. For me `Candyman&apos; confirmed this thesis. Her portrayal of Helen Lyle is truly one of the most excellent portrayals of a character I have seen recently. She gives her character so much depth, dimension and genuine emotions. Tony Todd also emerges from this film as a very talented and wonderful actor. The amount of depth, dimension and persona that he gives to the character of the `Candyman&apos; is amazing. Although the Candyman is in many ways a truly evil and frightening character, you also can&apos;t help but feel a great deal of sympathy for him at times and this too is a testament to Todd&apos;s acting. The supporting cast particularly Vanessa Williams and even the young kid who Helen interviews while in the neighbourhood-also deserve an honourable mention for giving their characters such a realistic edge.\n\nI would recommend this movie it is chilling, frightening, intriguing, compelling, sad and wonderful all in one. One of the best movies I have ever seen in this genre"

You&apos;ve had it a million times and it still tastes great!\n\nAnd to all the 1 star reviewers - you must seek help immediately because you clearly need a reality check. Do you check into an Economy Inn and expect the Ritz Carlton too?? What is wrong with you?! The movie is entertaining, quite funny, very light, and just overall fun. If you expected some life changing, never-seen-before comedy, then you are crazy."

Considering I&apos;m not fond of either of the actors in the two main roles, I really wanted to see this film. When I finally got around to watching it, I now understand why it struck a chord with me.\n\nWithout ever claiming to be a tribute to Mel Brooks, that&apos;s exactly what it ended up as. If you liked History of the World Part One you will like Year One as our two cave men progress up through the early years of human civilization and culture, encountering various biblical figures and getting themselves in and out of various tight spots.\n\nIt was really a fun little film that I think most all fans of Mel Brooks would appreciate. It is as much a nod to JudeoChristian history as it also pans it. It is a nod to Mel Brooks without being a complete copy cat of Mr. Brooks. It is meant to be a romp and not a serious film.\n\nPeople who brushed it off should give it a second chance and not try to over analyze or read to deep into it and just have a little fun. I gave it an 8, which is saying a lot from a person who doesn&apos;t like either lead.",

I watched this for the first time in 2024 and it stood the test of time. &quot;Man who catch fly with chopstick can accomplish anything&quot;. Classic.\n\nSure, a critics review might contain a more structural approach to rating, and it might crack down on scenes such as the completely random dropped cloth, or the ambiguity of Sato and Chozen&apos;s honor principle, and I would liked to have seen them both evolve as characters, but Karate Kid 2 is great entertainment and quite a cinematical experience.",

I found Thomas Horn&apos;s performance almost uncannily like my son&apos;s. The movie has a simple plot. Oskar lost his father in 9/11. He was incredibly devoted to his father. His Father Tom always found things for him to do that got him involved in one way or the other in the real world. His mother wonderfully played by Sandra Bullock stands at the sidelines and let&apos;s the father and son Bond. Tom creates a searching game. He gives Oskar a mission and provided the clues. After his father dies. Oskar finds a key in a blue vase,in his father&apos;s closet. He takes this to mean it&apos;s a quest from his Dad. Struggling with his loss he goes on this quest to find his Dad. What he finds and what he experiences will change his life and his mother&apos;s life forever. As well as the people he meets on his quest. Tom Hanks has basically a extended cameo but he turns in a startling job. Hanks does a emotional job that is refreshing and vibrant. As Tom Schell he wants his son to transcend the boundaries of his aspberger&apos;s. He want&apos;s Oskar to learn how to function in the real world by interacting with people. As a parent of a child with Aspberger&apos;s this movie was so hard to watch at times. Simply because I saw my own son reflected in the movie. I enjoyed this movie because it felt so true to life for me. Worth watching if you like this kind of story."

He is a hybrid of man and technology, and is trained to kill efficiently.\n\nThere is a lot of buzz around &quot;Hardcore Henry&quot; being the first film to be filmed in a first person perspective. To me, the film looks more like a video game, because Henry is moves so fast and is so good at killing. People around him just die so easily. Scenes move very quickly from one to another, and the location of the story moves very quickly as well. One second he is on the roof and then the next second he is in a car. I can hardly keep up with the pace and the story! Towards the end, I felt dizzy from all the constant motion, and I was lost by the plot. At least, it was cool to have watched Henry doing daredevil jumps from one floor to another as if he was walking on grass."

      "reviewBody": "Up until this film, probably the best film about Jackie Robinson was the one in which the star played himself. This wasn&apos;t a bad film, though it seemed very over-idealized. Finally, after all these years, Hollywood has finally put a nice budget into making a lovely tribute to this baseball great. However, and this isn&apos;t a complaint, it is NOT a film about the entire life of Robinson--just a tiny portion. Of course, it&apos;s clearly the most important part--his career in the minor leagues and his first year in major league baseball. It does not discuss how his career was unfortunately cut short by diabetes--as was his life. But the movie makers clearly couldn&apos;t do EVERYTHING--and they were wise to narrow the focus. But as for me, I&apos;d like to see a sequel--and what happened to Robinson AFTER the 1947 season. In fact, when the film ends, you see that Dodgers win the National League pennant--but you don&apos;t learn that they lost the World Series to the Yankees (that WOULD have been anticlimactic).\n\nSo what did I think of the film? Well, I thought it was terrific--and I really appreciated how the film tried to get the history correct (with a few tiny exceptions). Ben Chapman (the manager of the Phillies) really was a racist jerk. Robinson did, for a time, live in Sanford, Florida (that&apos;s a bit ironic). And, the film tried very hard to get the look right. I also appreciated seeing Harrison Ford try to stretch his range--uglying himself up and changing his voice so much to try to adequately portray Branch Rickey. All in all, a very, very inspiring and touching film--one even non-baseball players could love.",

      "reviewBody": "Okay let me start off by stating that this isn&apos;t the greatest horror movie or amazing by any means. But I think it&apos;s underrated or not given enough credit. For a film that is 15 years old it holds up pretty well except for the CGI and the plot isn&apos;t great. Dead silence is a film about the curse of Mary Shaw, where if you scream she&apos;ll kill you (I don&apos;t want to spoil much so I won&apos;t say to much) and she targets Jamie ashen, and Jamie must find out why she is targeting him by going back to his old home ravensfair to uncover the secret. The plots pretty simple and nothing crazy, but where this movie shines is it&apos;s atmosphere, Cinematography, acting, soundtrack and tense slow build scary moments. Now there still are jumpscares in this but there&apos;s also lots of slower intense moments and very disturbing parts which makes it way scarier to me rather than having constant loud jumpscares that are mainly scary because of the loud sound, and again this movie does have one or 2 but there&apos;s way more creepy moments that will have you at the edge of your seat or creeped out. The shots are also done very well and the transitions are awesome. The soundtrack is definitely memorable and fits the movie well. The acting is decent enough and I think the flashback scene in the theatre is one of my favourite scenes in the movie for its tone and the acting of judith Anna roberts, genuinely creepy scene. The film style/look is a bit dark and colourless which fits perfectly for such a dark movie like this. And the ending will definitely surprise you! Overall it&apos;s a pretty decent movie that is worth the watch if you haven&apos;t seen it already. It gets a 7/10 from me, I came in not expecting something good but I was surprised and creeped out. I can agree with people who do give it 6. It&apos;s understandable for those who thought the plot was boring. I think this movie could&apos;ve been better if it was 2-2.5 hours to expand on the characters and the story and backstory. I hope one day they revisit this series and make a sequel or remake that it deserves.",

There is so much filthy humor in this movie that is in no way suitable for children, but hey we adults need some idiocracy of our own every now and then and that is exactly what this movie brings to the table. Purely brilliant idiocracy. The best kind there is. It has a great cast and Danny McBride is hilarious as usual. Definitely worth watching. Be forewarned, it is DIRTY!!!"

Even Chicken Little&apos;s dad was terrible and didn&apos;t redeem himself. However, this movie isn&apos;t terrible. It wasn&apos;t exactly boring, with quite a few action packed scenes and character growth from Chicken Little and his friends.

      "reviewBody": "It is somewhat difficult for me to explain my viewing experience of this film, and in no way do I mean to sound condescending of uppity, so kindly bear with me... Usually, after years of &quot;experience&quot; with a certain hobby, one is able to differentiate objective criticism from lack of personal satisfaction. For me, The Boy is a perfect example, so I&apos;ll make sure to separate my personal opinions from what I perceive to be the makings of a fine Horror film.\n\nI&apos;ve always been a big fan of the Supernatural sub-genre, with a special liking to films portraying evil dolls (films like Dead Silence or Annabelle, NOT Chucky). After watching the trailer for The Boy several months ago, I&apos;ve been eagerly anticipating its release. As presented in the teasers, the story is original and well told (hats off to screenwriter Stacey Menear), and the jump-scares (while still cheap) are sufficiently few and well made to add the occasional scare without damaging the experience. Music and cinematography are great, as is the acting (especially supporting actors Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle as Mr. and Mrs. Hillshire).\n\nNow for my problem... the plot twist is smart, surprising and in no way predictable (although some of you might have guessed it from the start, I personally was impressed). It adds a stroke of genius creativity and originality to an otherwise all too known pattern of a film. I just didn&apos;t like it... it felt too original, like trying to reinvent the wheel when the wheel works just fine. Objectively - great twist, great ending! In my opinion? A let down.\n\nAll in all, the eerie sense of suspense and fear is maintained throughout the entire film, and I would definitely recommend it to other &quot;supernatural dolls&quot; fans. However, personally, I couldn&apos;t help but feeling it was ultimately a let-down, and I wouldn&apos;t watch it again.",

      "reviewBody": "With this adaptation of S. E. Hinton&apos;s debut novel &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, Francis Ford Coppola introduced a whole new generation of actors, who would go on to become some of Hollywood&apos;s biggest stars over the course of the next few years and decades. The story is a coming-off-age tale set in an unspecified American town during the early 1960s, where the dividing line between the north and south side of town, between the working-class &quot;greasers&quot; and the upper-class &quot;socs&quot;, defined the upbringing, youth years and prospects for the future for all the characters we get to meet. Focusing on the greasers - and more on the ties and comradery between them than on the greaser culture as such - The Outsiders is a tenderhearted, unobtrusive film full of semi-obvious observations and character-developments. As such, it feels like the school essay that the novel more or less started out as. Still, the film has a perception and understanding for these kids, their time and their surroundings that makes it resonant and believable. Artistically, this is by no means Coppola&apos;s best work, and all of these actors would go on to deliver better work later on in their careers, but their characters and their performances have stood the test of time quite well. Look for Coppola&apos;s pal Tom Waits in a cameo as a bouncer in a bar. C. Thomas Howell won the Young Artist Award for Best Young Motion Picture Actor for his performance as Ponyboy Curtis.",

      "reviewBody": "In this romantic black comedy, Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as Lee Holloway, the lady worker of the title. As you probably already know, this secretary doesn&apos;t just push pens and use paper clips, she has another, more exciting capacity as her boss&apos;s love object. The film actually isn&apos;t quite as naughty as many people think it thinks it is, but the truth is that the sadomasochistic area of the film isn&apos;t really all that important. The film isn&apos;t really about obscure sexual preferences, it&apos;s about finding someone whom you are comfortable with and the S&amp;M is just a means to an end. The sex aspect of the film does serve a purpose, however, in that it&apos;s that which makes the film a social satire of this culture of flirting in the office; a very over the top one, that is, and one that gives the film it&apos;s shock value; but to be honest, you don&apos;t really get to see that much bondage. The film is very original in it&apos;s portrayal of S&amp;M however, as it&apos;s a very taboo subject and for it to be portrayed in a sweet and upbeat manner like this is welcome and very different.\n\nAs mentioned, Maggie Gyllenhaal takes the title role and starring opposite her is James Spader as her boss. Gyllenhaal&apos;s character is sweet, inexperienced and bashful. She&apos;s very easy to like, but she can also be annoying at times. Spader&apos;s character is the complete opposite; despite being insecure, he comes across as being cold, calm and collected. He keeps his emotions hidden inside and reveals very little about himself, unlike Maggie&apos;s character who is happy to wear her emotions on her sleeve and doesn&apos;t seem to mind what other people think. Observe the way that the boss continues to tell her to put her shoes on because her feet stink etc; not exactly the most conscientious person to ever walk the earth. Despite being chalk and cheese, however, the two characters blend together in a way that is both believable and interesting, and this makes for some great chemistry between the two leads that is hard not to enjoy. The fact that they are chalk and cheese is a help and not a hindrance to the film as it serves in making it all the more interesting. My only quibble with the characterization is the ending, which although it brings the message out, seems tacked on and rather unrealisticbut it&apos;s not enough to spoil the film.\n\nOverall, Secretary is not a masterpiece, but it is a very good portrayal love, and one that is far superior to dull and dreary films such as &apos;Lost in Translation&apos;. It&apos;s entertaining for it&apos;s duration, there are several funny moments and the central message, which states that it&apos;s worth going to extremes for the one you love is a worthwhile one for any movie, even if it is someone lost under the premise of the movie. Recommended.",

The movie might make a case of that, if you want to look at it that way. It&apos;s Science Fiction alright, but it does have a moral core in it, that you&apos;ll either like or dismiss.\n\nWhatever the case, I&apos;m sure many like the general idea of the movie, and because it is a &quot;secret&quot;, this could actually be going on right now. But whatever you believe (or not), this will challenge some of your views, for better or worse. It might be very easy to see where this is going, but it&apos;s still a ride worth taking (especially if you&apos;re fond of the genre)",

      "reviewBody": "(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon.)\n\nThis movie really made me think about sexual differences and what it means to have a sex change or to want one, or to be trapped in a gender you don&apos;t want. It was very effective to have us see Hilary Swank (who plays Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon) with short hair and male facial expressions and gestures without giving us a glimpse of her as Teena. (Actually we did get a brief glimpse in a photo.) Swank looks like a boy, acts like a boy, in fact works hard to be a boy; indeed that is (sadly) part of what this movie is about, what it means to be a boy in middle America as opposed to being a girl. And then when we have the scene with the tampons and the breast wrapping and we see her legs, the effect is startling, an effect possibly lost on those who knew that the person playing Brandon was a woman. It was when I saw her legs and could tell at a glance that she was a woman with a woman&apos;s legs that I realized just how subtle, but unmistakable are the anatomical sexual differences, and how convincing Swank&apos;s portrayal was.\n\nI was reminded as I watched this of being a young person, of being a teenager and going through all the rituals and rites, unspoken, unplanned, without social sanction, that we all go through to prove our identity, because that is what Brandon was so eager to do, to prove his identity as a boy. I thought, ah such an advantage he has with the girls because he knows what they like and what they want. He can be smooth, and how pretty he looks. It was strange. I actually knew some guys in my youth who had such talent, and the girls did love them.\n\nThe direction by Kimberly Peirce is nicely paced and the forebodings of horror to come are sprinkled lightly throughout so that we don&apos;t really think about the resolution perhaps until the campfire scene in which John Lotter shows his self-inflicted scars and tosses the knife to Brandon. Then we know for sure, something bad is going to happen.\n\nHilary Swank is very convincing. Her performance is stunning, and she deserved the Academy Award she won for Best Actress. She is the type of tomboy/girl so beloved of the French cinema, tomboyish, but obvious a girl like, for example, Zouzou as seen in Chloe in the Afternoon (1972) or Élodie Bouchez in the The Dreamlife of Angels (1998), or many others. Indeed, one is even reminded of Juliette Binoche, who of course can play anything, or going way back, Leslie Caron in Gigi (1958). Chloe Signvey, who plays Lana Tisdel, the girl Brandon loves, whom I first saw in Palmetto (1998), where she stole a scene or two from Woody Allen and Elisabeth Shue, really comes off ironically as butch to Swank, yet manages a sexy, blue collar girl next door femininity. She also does a great job. Peter Sarsgaard is perfect as John Lotter, trailer trash car thief and homophobic redneck degenerate.\n\nVery disturbing is the ending. If you know the story, you know the ending. Just how true this was to the real life story it is based on is really irrelevant. I knew nothing about the story, but I know that film makers always take license to tell it the way they think it will play best, and so it&apos;s best to just experience the film as the film, independent of the real story, which, like all real stories, can never be totally told.\n\nObviously this is not for the kiddies and comes as close to an &quot;X&quot; rating as any &quot;R&quot; movie you&apos;ll ever see. It will make most viewers uncomfortable, but it is the kind of story that needs to be told.",

The dialogue is PACKED with references to classical music artists/works/history/etc. Not to mention there are constant little allusions to different plot threads which make up Tar&apos;s whole story.\n\nHowever, this dies down gradually and the movie becomes much more focused and simple. Blanchett is incredible, but not in a showy way at all. Her conducting moments were awesome. The story is political and relevant, and handled very well and balanced-like.\n\nThere is a surprisingly creepy vibe to the film, that borders on something almost like a horror movie at times. It&apos;s quite unnerving.\n\nOne of the best movies i&apos;ve seen all year! Probably Todd Field&apos;s best work yet.",

      "reviewBody": "The Last House on the Left is directed by Dennis Iliadis and adapted to screenplay by Adam Alleca and Carl Ellsworth from the story by Wes Craven (co-producer here). A remake of Craven&apos;s 1972 film of the same name (itself influenced by Ingmar Bergman&apos;s The Virgin Spring), it stars Tony Goldwyn, Monica Potter, Garret Dillahunt, Sara Paxton, Spencer Treat Clark and Martha MacIsaac. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Sharone Meir.\n\nDuring a family vacation, teenagers Mari (Paxton) and Paige (MacIsaac) are viciously set about by a gang led by recent prison escapee Krug (Dillahunt). When bad weather forces Krug&apos;s car to career off the road, the gang, unbeknownst to them, seek refuge in the vacation home of Mari&apos;s parents. When the parents realise what their new lodgers have done, they begin to enact bloody retribution.\n\nIt&apos;s pointless going on about remakes of old horror films, they are here to stay and we continue to watch them in the hope that they will strike a chord with us. With The Last House on the Left, remaking it, to me at least, is understandable given the 72 film is not exactly a great classic itself. True enough to say it has that grainy grunginess that was so befitting the decade&apos;s horror movies, marking it out as an unsettling experience without really living up to its &quot;terrifying&quot; reputation. In fact if you put both movies together they still wouldn&apos;t have enough class in them to give Bergman&apos;s movie a run for its money.\n\nSo the remake then, all glossy and big budgeted, with name actors in the principal roles, it is by definition routinely packaged for the modern day audience. However, that doesn&apos;t take away from the fact that what unfolds on that screen is challenging us, it really does do its job. The pertinent question exists, are you capable of such violence having had violence inflicted on your loved ones previously? What would you do in the same situation that Mari&apos;s parents find themselves in?\n\nWe have been privy to what was meted out to poor Mari and Paige, and the impact is most distressing. There is good cause to argue that Iliadis and his production team go too far in grabbing our attention in readiness for the &quot;revenge&quot; factor later on. Certainly I myself was uncomfortable watching it, as I was with the I Spit on Your Grave remake, but it&apos;s about getting a prescribed response, however close to the knuckle it is.\n\nIt&apos;s not a film anyone can feel comfortable about recommending, surely? But I know it put me through a gamut of emotions, even making me feel bad about myself the next day. That is quite often the power of cinema, and clearly the banner that Craven and Iliadis held aloft during the publicity tours for The Last House on the Left. Today I give the film an uneasy 7/10, it&apos;s uncompromising and unapologetically violent, but also laced with flaws. On another day I may find myself rating it considerably lower",

      "reviewBody": "I haven&apos;t seen many films that really, truly made me rethink a long-held position or opinion on a thorny issue, but &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; is one of them.\n\nI read Sr. Helen Prejean&apos;s book, upon which this film was based, when it first came out in 1993.  At that time I was utterly supportive of capital punishment -- to quote the script, I felt anyone who committed crimes horrible enough to land them on Death Row was an &quot;expendable human being, suckin&apos; up tax dollars.&quot;  I also had personal experience with the issue when an entire family whom I knew in my childhood were slaughtered by a man who is now on Death Row for his crimes.\n\nAs you might imagine, I was disgusted with Sr. Helen&apos;s book.  I thought that trotting to death row and holding the hand of some scumbag who&apos;d killed innocent people was about the lowest thing anyone could do, and as a Catholic I was offended by the seeming hypocrisy of it.\n\nBecause I had disliked the book, I never saw the film until about two weeks ago, when I bought a remaindered copy of it in a video store.  I have watched it four times since then, mostly because I am trying to work out my feelings on it.  I am still a supporter of capital punishment, but it&apos;s going to be less easy for me to ignore the fact that (to quote again), &quot;There&apos;s nobody with money on Death Row&quot; -- and quite a few more blacks, now that I think of it, AND the fact that, like Matthew Poncelet&apos;s character, the men who are being executed are human beings who have feelings and fears. It&apos;s easy to jeer at Matthew on the day before his execution, fretting nervously about whether the lethal injection will &quot;hurt,&quot; like a little boy at the doctor&apos;s office for a penicillin shot, since his victims&apos; last moments certainly &quot;hurt.&quot; What isn&apos;t easy is to realize that while the victims of these inmates didn&apos;t know they were about to die until it was too late, the inmates themselves have what seems like a blessing at first, but upon deeper examination is the greatest curse:  knowing the exact hour and day they will die, and having to face it day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute.\n\nI&apos;m sorry if this review offends people who are sincere death penalty supporters.  I still consider myself to be one, but my thinking has been reformed somewhat and I&apos;m more ready to listen to the opponents and try to make compromises; maybe that&apos;s what this issue needs more than anything.  I will say finally that ONE part of this film did offend me as a Catholic: the symbolic &quot;crucifixion&quot; of Poncelet during the &quot;last words&quot; scene.  That was the one place where Robbins strayed from his even-handed approach to the issue -- the only one I could find.\n\nIn all, this was a fine film that made me rethink an explosive issue, and I recommend it highly to anyone debating the pros and cons."

      "reviewBody": "Steve Coogan has said that Philomena is his reaction against cynicism - his attempt to make an honest and fundamentally sincere film. The biggest compliment that can be paid to him is that, in these goals, he has succeeded.\n\nIt tells the story of Philomena Lee (Judi Dench, who is as brilliant as ever), an elderly Irish woman whose child was taken away from her 50 years ago by an austere Catholic convent. Martin Sixsmith (Coogan) is the cynical, know-it-all journalist turned government spin doctor, recently sacked, who is on the look out for a story. After a chance encounter at a party, Sixsmith reluctantly takes up the &apos;human interest&apos; story of Philomena&apos;s search for her son, Anthony.\n\nThe key to Philomena is the relationship between the titular character and Sixsmith. And it works. It really works, in fact. His cynicism, bordering on arrogance, is matched perfectly by her simple and completely sincere belief in common human decency. It could easily have been overly sentimental, but Judi Dench in particular does a remarkable job of keeping it grounded. \n\nThere&apos;s some very dark stuff here, and it&apos;s a testament to the script that the film does not become overwhelmed by it. The Magdalene laundries were awful places, yet this story is not about revenge. I was almost cheering when, at the end, Sixsmith gives one particularly odious nun a piece of his mind. But moments later Philomena accosts him and gives me a slap on the wrist. She does not want revenge or angry confrontation. She just wants the truth. It&apos;s a remarkable act of forgiveness, and one that, like Sixsmith, I could not agree with. But then, I&apos;m just another cynical and bitter atheist. I have to say, this film made me angry at myself for being one. And yet it also made me pleased I wasn&apos;t a Catholic. Go figure. \n\nPhilomena is an incredible and heartfelt story. It&apos;s desperately sad, yet never overly sentimental. There&apos;s some genuinely funny moments, mainly emanating from the contrast between the wide-eyed and refreshing simplicity of Philomena&apos;s world view and the weary wryness of Sixsmith. If you get a chance, see it.",

This is a very worthy remake, and almost on par in my opinion, and I thought I&apos;d never say that after seeing far too many pointless ones along the odd truly great one. The story is not quite as convincing here, it does have some great scenes that also some that don&apos;t quite work like the dance scene which was not very well filmed and didn&apos;t enhance the story as much as the chess scene of the original. However, visually it is very stylish, with striking locations, crisp photography and editing and great fashions. The direction as expected from John McTiernan is very convincing, the screenplay is taut and the soundtrack is memorable. Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo are fine leads, and their chemistry is somewhat steamier than the original&apos;s, and there is also some great support from Denis Leary and Faye Dunnaway herself. Overall, a more than worthy remake, loose of course but very stylish and classy. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "I am not going to get into details regarding how true an account this is or not. I have read a lot that seems to indicate he was guilty and others that he was innocent, both accounts seeing to contradict themselves. I guess we may never really know, but as someone who believes that racism infects a lot of society including organisations like Sporting bodies and the police I can well believe that being black would not guarantee a fair trial. However I also find it hard to believe that Mr Carter was as peaceful a person as depicted in this film. But this is down to the way the film was written and directed and in no way detracts from a truly remarkable piece of acting by Mr Denzel Washington. It seems in every part he plays, you believe that he IS that character and this film was no exception. In the boxing scenes or the prison scenes and in every scene you believe that you are watching Rubin &apos;The Hurricane&apos; Carter. A truly outstanding performance."

You must see it!&quot;-semantics (tho&apos; she IS right, for once!).\n\nThe story unfolds flawlessly, and we are taken along a journey that, I believe, most of us will come to recognize at some time. A compassionate, existentialist journey where we make amends för our past when approaching ourt inevitable demise.\n\nActing is without faults, cinematography likewise (occasionally quite brilliant!), and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the story.\n\nA warm movie. Not excessively sentimental.",

Ali Larter rejoins Milla along with Iain Glen to bring a ridicules plot to an end, hopefully. I couldn&apos;t stand the single camera action sequences, I felt like the camera was doing all the fighting and not the characters. Unlike the original where slow motion camera angles made the franchise famous, this one was made on the cheap. The franchise did become the single most successful horror movie series in history but this flick was less horror and more how did this whole storyline get started. You may skip this one but if you want t know the ending maybe check it out.",

      "reviewBody": "Steve Jobs isn&apos;t a nice guy... he uses people like they are toilet paper... and he is a taker. It&apos;s a great set-up for a slammin&apos; movie. Unfortunitely, this movie seems incomplete and without heart. More accurately, most of the scenes seem incomplete, disjointed and pointless. It all adds up to nothing.\n\nProblem #1) You don&apos;t care for Jobs and you leave the theater not knowing Jobs. There are few emotional moments in the movie - except when you want to spit on him. Fire this person unnecessarily; deny that loyal employee well-earned benefit; use your wealth to destabilize the company... it all describes someone you are glad you don&apos;t know personally or professionally.\n\nProblem #2) The movie is paced slower than my Aunt Minnie in a walker. I&apos;ve seen paint dry faster.\n\nProblem #3) The acting... maybe I should say the affectations. Kutcher over-emphasized Jobs odd gate and stance as if it meant something. But why distract us with an antalgic back, hyper-extension of the knees, increased lordosis and anterior propulsion? It distracted from the story and took me out of the movie every time.\n\nProblem #4) The editing was horrible. Scenes would start and finish randomly - with no emotional content. Many scenes had no relationship to the structure of the movie - taking valuable time and adding little to nothing; disjointed would be too nice of a word.\n\nProblem #5) The strange arc of the story-line ended before it began in earnest. The writing didn&apos;t explain how the apple II was able to sustain the many, many years of subsequent failures. Do corporations really build stockholders via &quot;image&quot;, not performance? Metaphysically, I know that untalented a-holes who use, abuse and throw people away deserve to suffer. But we didn&apos;t see suffering. We see a fabulously wealthy person, whose emotional system was M.I.A, slide through life on the efforts of others.\n\nThere is no teaching moment in this movie. There is no emotional content. There are no memorable lines or moments. This isn&apos;t a movie; it feels more like revenge, cold and pointless.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the truly great films of 2010, &quot;A Prophet&quot; is an unforgettable account of a young man&apos;s experiences in a French prison.\n\nMalik El Djebena is only 19 when he&apos;s sentenced to six years in prison for a crime he claims he didn&apos;t commit. Though an Arab, Malik becomes the cat&apos;s-paw for an aging Corsican mob boss named Cesar Luciani whose influence in the prison has begun to wane as more and more Muslims are brought in to swell the prisoner ranks. Eventually, the ever-resourceful Malik finds a way to straddle the lines separating the various factions in the prison, while at the same time partnering with his buddy to run a hashish operation when he&apos;s out on his frequent 24-hour leaves.\n\nThe beauty of &quot;A Prophet&quot; is that we really get the sense that, had he been dealt a halfway decent hand in life, Malik might have actually been a kind, caring person, instead of the lost soul that he&apos;s become. But the lack of any parental influence in his life, his illiteracy, and now his consignment to prison life have left him with few viable options other than to become involved in mayhem and crime. He&apos;s horrified by the fact that, as a kind of loyalty test early on, Luciani forces him to murder in cold blood a man he doesn&apos;t know and might even like under other circumstances. And there are heartbreaking moments throughout where we sense the goodness in Malik&apos;s tortured soul. His appreciation of simple kindnesses, his attempts at learning to read, his childlike wonder as he looks out of a plane window for the first time, his tenderness with a buddy&apos;s newborn son - all go a long way towards mitigating some of the truly despicable acts of violence and murder he&apos;s called upon to do. The brilliant screenplay wisely refuses to judge Malik; it simply presents the options and parameters that have been given to him by fate, society, nature, what have you - and watches as he maneuvers through, in and around them in order to survive.\n\nHarsh and brutal as this film can be at times - for it never shies away from portraying what life is like in a prison setting - it is in those more lyrical moments, the ones in which we are allowed to see into the heart of this young man, that &quot;A Prophet&quot; achieves true masterpiece status.\n\nTahar Rahim rises to the challenge in a brilliantly understated, award-worthy performance as Malik, capturing our sympathy and concern throughout. Niels Arestrup is also outstanding as the brutal and demanding Luciani, as is Adel Bencherif as Malik&apos;s one friend from prison who serves as both a positive and a negative influence on the young man.\n\nDirected with unerring conviction and power by Jacques Audiard, &quot;A Prophet&quot; is a cinematic work of art - and a movie not to be missed.",

Unlike so many of his contemporaries from the Eighties, he&apos;s proved to have staying power and will no doubt continue to do so. \n\nAll The Right Moves established Cruise as a dramatic actor, but Risky Business is a fun comedy about a hormone driven teenager who when the folks go away from his Chicago suburban home and he&apos;s left to play, he gets himself in all kinds of problems. First dialing up call girl, Rebecca DeMornay and then not having enough coin of the realm to pay her. Then getting mom&apos;s treasured glass egg stolen. And then getting the family car driven into Lake Michigan.\n\nBut Cruise and DeMornay, who is having trouble with her pimp Joe Pantoliano, hit on the brilliant idea that there&apos;s a market out there for his group of eager overachievers. And Tom&apos;s house becomes quite the swinging brothel.\n\nRisky Business turns out to be pretty funny business. Best scene in the film involves Tom with Princeton interviewer Richard Mazur. You&apos;ve got to love the way this boy gets into the Ivy League. Second best scene involves Tom and the family car as it plunges into the lake and then gets hoisted out.\n\nTom&apos;s definitely proved to have staying power in show business. I can see his character in Risky Business growing up to be Jerry Maguire.",

      "reviewBody": "John Dolittle was a worrying child  his father always caught him pretending to talk to animals and eventually had to get him to stop it.  As an adult, his gift is long forgotten until he hits a dog with his car and hears it talk to him.  When he realises that he is not going crazy and he can talk to them he is suddenly inundated with animals to treat, his family is falling apart and his business partners think their whole business is at risk.\n\nEddie Murphy basically rebuild his career around a couple of big comedy remakes which relied on humour and effects.  Here the humour consists of good lines and the effects the animatronic animals.  The plot is the weakest point of the film and, although it has a basic story, it never really involves or becomes important.  Supporting the film then is some funny lines (rather than consistent jokes) from the animal support cast  whether it be main characters (Rodney the hamster) or quick one-liners (`I am Kyser Soze&apos;).\n\nThe effects are surprisingly ropey  they look good but they don&apos;t move naturally and the cuts between the real animals and the puppets are very clear.  The support cast basically carry the movie and save it from being pretty dire stuff.  Rock, Brooks, MacDonald, Leguizamo, Shandling etc all do good work and their dialogue basically consists of one-liners rather than anything else.  Beside this the adult cast look like straight men.  Murphy is quite dull and even the likes of Platt and Boyle (who usually do OK in small roles) have little to do.\n\nOverall this is fun to watch simply because of the support cast and the regular sharp lines of dialogue from the animals.  However, look for any more than that and you&apos;ll be disappointed."

      "name": "A decent debut from director Grant Singer that strives to be this year&apos;s Gone Baby Gone or Prisoners that while intriguing feels like it&apos;s missing something",
      "reviewBody": "Set in the town of Scarborough, Detective Tom Nichols (Benecio del Toro) and his partner Dan Cleary (Ato Essandoh) investigate the murder of real-estate broker Summer Elswick (Matilda Lutz). As the two run down possible suspects including Summer&apos;s boyfriend Will Grady (Justin Timberlake), her ex-husband Sam Gifford (Karl Glusman), and a man with a grudge against the Gradys named Eli Phillips (Michael Pitt), the case goes from a simple murder to something of larger scale implications.\n\nReptile is the feature film debut of music video director Grant Singer who also co-wrote the script alongside Benjamin Brewer and the film&apos;s star and executive producer Benicio Del Toro. Singer and Brewer wrote the initial draft of the film in 2018 where it was acquired by Black Label Media who&apos;d previously worked with Del Toro on the Sicario films and upon showing it to him he became a huge proponent of the project. With a gritty noir story, an all star cast, and an Autumn adjacent release date you can tell Netflix wants this to be their equivalent of Gone Baby Gone or Prisoners as that dark horse crime thriller that scores some Oscar nominations, and while it doesn&apos;t reach those heights unfortunately it&apos;s an ultimately decent detective thriller with a strong sense of style and some committed performances.\n\nDespite being the debut feature of Grant Singer, he shows a strong grasp on filmmaking from a stylistic and technical sense with the film given some solid shots that capture the environments in which Nichols investigates. With a predominantly suburban setting that often uses the states of various homes like McMansion Grady is trying to sell having signs of vermin infestation or a neglected swimming pool with stagnant water, you get the sense Singer is trying to capture that underlying sense of rot within these seemingly idyllic homes. While Tom Nichols isn&apos;t given the greatest depth as a protagonist, del Toro who serves as a co-writer on the film does add some humanity to the role especially in regards to his relationship with his wife Judy played by Alicia Silverstone who takes what could&apos;ve been an underwritten character and makes her more of a confidant who actually assists Tom on several occasions and the two have some solid chemistry together. Where the movie faulters for me unfortunately is in the mystery aspect of the film especially in how it establishes its array of suspects only for us to switch gears at the one hour mark where we begin another decidedly different investigation. The writing in the film while fine most of the time is perfectly fine (if not exceptional) but it does lead to some groanworthy dialogue exchanges and a fake-out dream sequence that I didn&apos;t really care for.\n\nFor those who like dramatic procedural thrillers of this kind you will find some good elements to appreciate here especially in how it relates to the acting and visuals on display. The movie itself as a mystery I&apos;m sorry to say fell somewhat flat for me despite seemingly having all the right pieces in play. A slight stumble out the gate for Grant Singer, but one that shows promise if given refinement.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Halloween Kills&apos; is the definition of a sequel for the sake of making a sequel (or more accurately the sake of making money). It not only adds nothing to the story, it destroys some of the good things from the 2018 version. I&apos;ve been looking forward to this movie for a long time with the COVID delays, and I sadly have to say it was not worth the wait at all.\n\nThe characters in this movie were atrocious. Firstly, they destroyed &apos;Laurie Strode&apos;. Not only does she do absolutely nothing in this movie, she is rude to kind nurses and assaults a doctor. Yup, that&apos;ll get us on her side. But that wasn&apos;t even the worst of it. The side characters they created for this film were embarrassing. There is a scene where a character just stares at &apos;Michael Myers&apos;, says something to the effect of, &quot;Michael, you&apos;ve come home&quot;, and then just stands there and waits to be killed. That&apos;s the worst example of it, but this is very much a rinse and repeat thing throughout the film.\n\nThe pacing of the film is all over the place too. There&apos;s a very strange and uninteresting opening scene. Then we get a couple of admittedly great scenes with the firefighters and in a house with a couple. At this point I was having a good time. &apos;Michael&apos; was ferocious and in no mood to mess around. Then we hit a wall and frankly never recovered. Even at the end when the film should be building up to the big conclusion, it feels like it&apos;s stuck in first gear.\n\nAlso there&apos;s a subplot involving a mental patient that is just unpleasant. It&apos;s not scary, it&apos;s not clever, it&apos;s just depressing and unnecessary (and quite insulting to the audience that we are expected to buy it). I didn&apos;t find much to enjoy about this film sadly. It looks great and the start was decent. Otherwise though it&apos;s not one I can recommend. 4/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a huge fan of the movie Once. When I arrived at South By Southwest, and saw that John Carney had directed another movie, I have to say I was a bit skeptical that he could capture the magic of that movie again without the amazing music and raw performances of Glen Hansard.\n\nMy fears were unfounded.\n\nSING STREET is a heartfelt, funny and artful coming-of-age movie set in 1985 Dublin. I&apos;m close to an ideal audience member for this film, because I grew up in the 80s myself, a child of the MTV Generation. I count John Hughes&apos; films and the Cameron-Crowe scripted Fast Times At Ridgemont High among the most influential films of my childhood. They are the reason I became a screenwriter, and why I continue to write movies for a teen audience.\n\nSing Street truly hearkens back to those great teen movies of the 80s. The best stories about teenagers are rooted in pain and isolation, and this is no different - Connor &quot;Cosmo&quot; Lawler comes from an upper middle class family that has fallen on hard times. His parents have constant fights. His older brother Brendan is a college dropout and his sister, the &apos;smart one,&apos; pretty much keeps to herself. In order for the family to save money, Connor is transferred to the local Catholic boys school, where he&apos;s quickly made an outcast and an example by the authoritarian headmaster.\n\nYou could say that this is a movie about forming a band. And this genre of story - of artistic awakening - seems to be replayed quite often in British and Irish films like The Commitments, Billy Elliott, The Full Monty, and others. But those movies each had a unique wrinkle, and Sing Street does too. It&apos;s the beautifully told story of the way that the inspiration and inception of the best art is rarely an individual act of genius, but rather, the result of a series of interconnected acts of human desire and emotion.\n\nIt&apos;s the parents who sentence you to a horrible school; the girl who you long for that won&apos;t give you the time of day; the other guys who join your band because they&apos;re outcasts too... the brother who loves you too much, and is too angry at his own cowardice, to let you settle for less than your best.\n\nThere&apos;s also a lot of great humor in Sing Street about the fact that you have to try on the styles of your heroes before you find your own confidence. 40-something audiences will definitely get another level of enjoyment out of all the allusions to great 80s bands. The art direction and costumes are done wonderfully in that respect. But I think this movie will work wonderful for today&apos;s teenagers as well.\n\nThe movie is by turns funny, heart-wrenching, soaring and surprising. And the musical numbers, while not necessarily Oscar winning, like Once, is great. I&apos;m thrilled that a new generation of teenagers will get to experience the release of a movie that&apos;s on par with the films I love so much as a kid.",

I hadn&apos;t seen him in movies before but I&apos;m definitely a fan now. The story has a definite twist which kept me interested. If you can get past the violence and some nudity, I&apos;d really recommend it. Lot of action and suspense and a good story line. The theater was full when I went and the audience clapped for the movie at the end - which means most of them enjoyed it too.",

The film captures life, I mean the characters, and I&apos;m mostly referring to Wesley (Robbie Amell) and Bianca (Mae Whitman), are realistic, humanized. I got a weird sense that I was watching people I knew and not a stereotypical film version of them. The movie has that documentary feel to it and it&apos;s due to how the leads portrayed their characters and how easy it is to relate to them.\n\nThe only real disappointment I have with the movie is that I thought it would be funnier. It&apos;s still a comedy but it&apos;s a little more serious than I expected. Watching the trailer I thought that I would laugh a hell of a lot more, specially when you look at the established comedic cast in it. Whitman and Amell do have good comedic timing and The DUFF is fairly funny but the quality of the jokes are not as high as I hopped they would be. \n\nThe story is intelligent, insightful, and kind of funny but it&apos;s still very predictable. The DUFF is on the edge of being great but it&apos;s not. \n\n@wornoutspines",

      "reviewBody": "Milton (Nicholas Cage), long hair bleached and greased back with vengeance, tosses his duffel bag into the back of newly-met stranger Piper&apos;s (Amber Heard) Dodge Charger. With her hands shoved into her daisy barely dukes, the uncertainty in her gaze is lost on, or possibly ignored by, Milton. As he opens the door to get in:\n\nPiper: &quot;I don&apos;t pick up hitchhikers, you know.&quot;\n\nMilton: &quot;I wasn&apos;t stickin&apos; out my thumb.&quot;\n\n*car door slam*\n\nThis early scene sums up exactly what you&apos;re getting yourself into with the Nicholas Cage driven movie, Drive Angry. You&apos;ve seen the trailers. You&apos;ve experienced Cage&apos;s knack to play unhinged, surrealistic characters. This 70&apos;s throwback to the pulp, metal on metal, grindhouse era of film doesn&apos;t ask you if you want a ride. You jump in without invitation and only know one thing: you&apos;d better strap in. And it&apos;s with this that Drive Angry does not disappoint.\n\nMilton, in his &apos;64 Riviera, has just escaped from imprisonment and is searching for a baby snatched from her mother by a devil-worshipping cult hellbent on a full moon sacrifice led by Jonah King (Billy Burke of The Twilight Saga), a southernly sadistic soothsayer. It seems Milton&apos;s own daughter was once stolen from him by the same cult and, well, he&apos;s experiencing a little road rage as he shoots his way through one lead to the next. Along the way, he joins up with Piper and her &apos;68 Charger who&apos;s pretty looks pack a pretty punch and isn&apos;t afraid to gun and run. All the while they are being chased across 6 state lines by trigger happy cops and The Accountant (William Fichtner of Prison Break), a seemingly supernatural hunter looking to return Milton to his warm, warm prison. Throw in a &apos;71 Chevelle, unapologetic bloodshed, and absolutely necessary explosions, and you have one darkly comedic, action fueled vehicle.\n\nDrive Angry embraces the fact that it is ridiculous by nature which makes it very enjoyable. The over the top dialogue, car chases, and 3D shootouts really add to making this a midnight moviegoer&apos;s film. Patrick Lussier and Todd Farmer (My Bloody Valentine 3D) aimed to keep the integral car sequences visceral and strayed away from CGI for a majority of the chases, though there is plenty of CGI elsewhere. Being an unabashed opponent to the influx of 3D in the cinema today, Drive Angry was filmed as a 3D film from the start and I actually liked it. Some shots were intentionally gimmicky which added to the humor, but the entire movie is a bit over the top and it flowed nicely.\n\nDrive Angry makes no assumptions that it is anything but a popcorn-spilling, laugh-out- loud, violently raw roller coaster on its way no where near an Oscar. And it&apos;s better for it. If you don&apos;t mind having an arm shot and projected at your face while Nic Cage loses touch with reality, Drive Angry will provide an entertaining distraction from the repetitive daily commute.\n\n3.5 seat belts out of 5\n\n-MovieFloss.com",

Even without Del Toros creature shop, the digital characters &amp; translations from the Hellboy comic were on point, interesting &amp; terrifying. The R rating, is probably the movies biggest flaw- excess swearing &amp; SUPER graphic violence seem unnecessary &amp; is probably a box office mistake for a paranormal action movie that kids would absolutely love. Except for the origin briefly retold, it seems like JUST another great Hellboy adventure more than a reboot, being so close to the first two movies that Del Toro &amp; Pearlman could EASILY come back with a sequel in a years&apos; time &amp; it not hurt whatsoever. While skeptical to begin with I completely warmed up to it in very short time- fun, gross, crazy &amp; very likable.",

      "name": "The American substitutes outlandish action for a vacuous yet restrained dramatic thriller.",
      "reviewBody": "It was only a matter of time before I watched this. A film hated by audiences for its misrepresenting marketing and rarely discussed amongst cinephiles due to its style over substance. The plot is vacuous no question, and struggles to fill up its runtime. However, as a character study, I believe Corbijn&apos;s minimalistic approach to be incredibly nuanced and tasteful. A contract killer on the run is temporarily residing in the Italian countryside where he has one final task to pull off for a client, to which he meets a woman he is romantically interested in.\n\nThe editing for the film cleverly lures viewers in, with one of two short shootouts being shown right at the start. This immediately sets a precedent for action, or perhaps stylish spy shenanigans. Once Clooney&apos;s silent but deadly protagonist finds his way stuck in the beautiful town of Castelvecchio, Corbijn slows the pace down to a grinding halt. Every action, destination or conversation is shown through Ruhe&apos;s gorgeous minimalistic cinematography. Ten minutes can be spent just following Clooney down a street, edited only to change camera positions. For some, this will be a major deterrent that will force many to turn off before reaching the halfway mark.\n\nHowever, upon reflection, Corbijn&apos;s deliberate slow pace makes sense. He attempts to thematically convey the loneliness of this contract killer, inevitably disposing of those who grow attached to him. One could argue that mainstream spy flicks like &apos;Casino Royale&apos; convey this through spectacular extravaganza, yet The American opts for an arthouse approach. Does it achieve the same results? In a way, yes. The biggest problem with this film is the lack of plot. It becomes overbearing at times that nothing is actually happening and is unable to evoke any characterisation or engrossing dialogue, but still remains intriguing thanks to the rural scenery and Clooney&apos;s nuanced performance.\n\nIt&apos;s peculiar, and a film that has lingered on my mind for some time now. It&apos;s unfortunately too empty to be a flawed masterpiece, leading me to look at my watch on various occasions, but certainly doesn&apos;t deserve the resentment that it has received. Technically meticulous yet unable to escape the all too common &quot;style over substance&quot; trait.",

      "reviewBody": "James Whale&apos;s 1931 adaptation of Mary Shelley&apos;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was one of the earliest films to chronicle man&apos;s quest (via science and nature, and in notably strict defiance of God) to literally create life by transgressing human reproduction; granted, the result was the hideous, hulking visage of Boris Karloff, but one couldn&apos;t help but be in awe of the sheer gumption of Victor Frankenstein and his accomplices. Roman Polanski evolved this idea (via adaptation of Ira Levin&apos;s novel) in &quot;Rosemary&apos;s Baby,&quot; which took the notion of creating something truly awful (the son of Satan) and using it as a metaphor for a woman&apos;s self-destruction and paranoia during pregnancy. Larry Cohen&apos;s &quot;It&apos;s Alive&quot; took contemporary paranoias of a carcinogen-engulfed atmosphere and nuclear proliferation and applied it to his own murderous, bloodthirsty infant. And rounding out this prolific bunch is David Lynch&apos;s &quot;Eraserhead,&quot; a hauntingly surreal horror film that not only presents parenthood with fearful uncertainty, but treats acts of sexuality and procreation with a metaphorically clinical (but never explicit) disgust.\n\nVincenzo Natali&apos;s &quot;Splice&quot; falls somewhere within this noteworthy pantheon of mad science, moral/ethical conundrums, and icky special effects. Many have already drawn comparisons (both positive and negative) to the early, mutation-informed works of Canadian auteur David Cronenberg, but Natali is just as interested in exploring the questions under the surface as he is showing an astutely creative visual eye. For a while, the film plays like something closer to an art-house feature (especially given the presence of character actors like Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley) with intriguing ideas and a solid FX budget. There are missteps along the way, but for the most part, this is a solid little sleeper.\n\nClive (Brody) and Elsa (Polley) are young scientists who have made a breakthrough in artificial life: two blob-like creatures (one male, one female) with the ability to manufacture an artificial protein for the purpose of nourishing livestock. In typical, business-first fashion, their corporate overlords marvel at the notion of mass-manufacturing it, and promptly reject Elsa&apos;s proposition of human experimentation (to cure genetic disorders). Driven by curiosity, the duo wind up creating Dren (Delphine Chaneac), a creature whose accelerated life cycle prompts the creepily maternal Elsa to keep her as part of a more personal &quot;experiment.&quot; &quot;Splice&quot; contains subtle, well-played allusions to bad childhoods, long-term psychoses, and the shifting roles of parents in the eyes of children (Clive starts off as vehemently oppositional; later, he becomes a reluctant accomplice who ultimately develops a bizarre affection for the creation), not to mention the tension between parents amid the child-rearing process; watching this trio interact supplies most of the film&apos;s compelling, hypnotic moments. This deliberate pace and focus on character may prove off-putting to horror fans sold on the ADHD weirdness of the trailer, but those with open minds will find much to gorge themselves on.\n\nDespite all the admirably creative spins on familiar concepts, Natali (or perhaps the producers, action aficionado Joel Silver being one) run out of fresh material by the climax, which takes chase clichés and overdone monster effects down a road that exists solely to patch up some character arcs and drum up excitement in a blandly conventional way. That being said, the first 3/4 of &quot;Splice&quot; is such a surprisingly effective slow burn of suspense and dread (culled from universal hopes and fears), played out by actors who know the fine line between camp and creep, that its later machinations are pretty easy to forgive.\n\n6.5 out of 10",

It helps when the movie is directed by Ridley Scott, based on a noel by Peter Mayle and has a supporting cast of Albert Finney, Tom Hollander and the drop dead gorgeous and under-rated actress Marion Cotillard. The essence of the plot is a man deciding what he wants from life, and the enjoyment of the movie is watching him reach that decision. Contains occasional swearing (to be honest I&apos;m a Londoner, so I never notice it) and has no nudity, so I&apos;d call this a family movie. Two thumbs up from me.",

      "reviewBody": "Part of me was interested in seeing &apos;The Grinch&apos;, being a fan of the original Dr Seuss story and especially the 1966 animated version with Boris Karloff voicing Grinch (do like the Jim Carrey version better than most) and being someone who likes Benedict Cumberbatch and a lot of what he&apos;s done. Was nervous though too because the trailer did not look good, the reviews are mixed to not great and did question whether it was necessary.\n\nDr Seuss adaptations have been very hit and miss. The animated short television specials have fared significantly better than the feature films, Dr Seuss&apos; work lends itself better to adaptations of a short length and the television specials were not only great adaptations and true in detail and spirit but great on their own. Of the feature films, the best one is by far &apos;Horton Hears a Who&apos; with the worst being the live action &apos;The Cat in the Hat&apos; (to me among the worst films ever made). Illumination has also been variable, loved the first two &apos;Despicable Me&apos; films while not caring for &apos;Minions&apos;.\n\nSaw &apos;The Grinch&apos; anyway as someone trying to see and review as many 2018 films as possible and loving the story and Christmas films, also to see how Cumberbatch would fare as Grinch. Seeing it, it is nowhere near as good as the 1966 version and is neither a Christmas cracker or a bah humbug. It is also neither among the best or worst films of the year, somewhere in the middle for me.\n\nThere are definitely great things here. The animation cannot be faulted, so much gorgeous and meticulous attention to detail and rich vibrant colours that really immerses one into the world of Whoville. Some of the soundtrack has a festive and infectious feel. There are funny and emotional moments, the former with the funny and adorable (plus more interesting) Max and the latter with the Cindy Lou subplot, that and the character herself being the sweet and charming heart of the film.\n\nIt is not a film without soul, having a warm glow more than once and some spirited elaborate set pieces, it does well with sticking to the spirit of the story and with the back and forth between Mount Crumpet and Whoville. It is not too long and has a lively pace generally. As said, Max and Cindy Lou are the best characters. Mostly the voice acting is good, with Cameron Seely being the clear standout.\n\nHaving said all of this, &apos;The Grinch&apos; could have been better. It does offer very little new or fresh, trying to be faithful to the source material while not moving enough beyond that that it all feels too safe. It could have done with more humour and heart generally, could have done without the repetitive and tired screaming goat gag and outside of the Cindy Lou subplot soul is missing.\n\nFound myself mixed on the pretty unrecognisable Cumberbatch. He does well providing a curmudgeonly touch and has moments of grinchy- meanness, plaudits too for not making Grinch too scary or resorting to excessive mugging. Do feel though that he was not mean or Grinchy-enough and he would have fared much better using his own voice for the character which would have fitted better. Had a big issue with the annoying, intrusive and over-explanatory narration that was not always necessary and with a rather out of place Pharrell Williams. Other parts of the soundtrack grated and too reminiscent of commercial music neither catchy or to my taste that didn&apos;t gel with the setting or the rest of the film. Too many of the supporting characters are forgettable and one-dimensional.\n\nOverall, better than what the critics have generally said but was rather mixed on a film with a lot of great merits but feels too safe and one does question the point of it. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "We all know how legendary The Doors were and still are, and sooner or later someone was going to make a film about them. Might as well be Oliver Stone. Given the subject matter, Stone was able to go off the deep end with his imagery here to the point of making one have an epileptic seizure OR think they just dropped some acid. Either way, it&apos;s great to watch in my book.\n\nThe film is flawed in that it&apos;s not titled correctly. It&apos;s not about The Doors, it&apos;s about Jim Morrison and basically just the wild and crazy side of him. That&apos;s ok I guess, Morrison was The Doors. Many have criticized Stone for not depicting Jim in the proper light, but given how many people knew him it had to be an almost impossible task to please everyone as everyone knew him differently. I think we all can attest to this through the friendships we have with our friends. Some know us as one way, and some know us as another. I respect Stone for trying and feel sorry for him about the flak people have given him as I know he is a very talented director. I think his intentions were spawned out of true admiration and that he made this film for himself and to pay tribute, and not to win any awards. More of this can be found on the Special Edition DVD from Stone himself.\n\n Even if one does not enjoy the trippy qualities of the film such as I do, or any part for that matter, one could not avoid admitting how well Val Kilmer portrays Morrison. It&apos;s simply amazing and is one of the best performances that I can bring to mind, and is the best example of how to literally become someone else, bar none. He doesn&apos;t act like he&apos;s Jim Morrison, he becomes Jim Morrison. He is Jim Morrison. This is no doubt helped by the uncanny facial similarities the two have. Not only that, most of the singing that&apos;s in the film was done by Kilmer himself and even a few of the original band members admitted that they honestly could not tell the difference between their two voices. Even if you hate Val Kilmer, this performance jumps in your face and screams for respect while trying to strangle you.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, some do not like the film for several reasons. One is that it makes Jim look like a monster and that it only glorifies his wild and uninhibited behavior. Two is that it&apos;s basically just one big acid trip into bits of history about the band. For one, Oliver Stone said it best....when you have to condense a person&apos;s life, a legend at that, into two measly hours you must take the highlights. Everyone lives longer than two hours, even Jim. We all know Jim was crazy, and with so many of the insane stories Stone heard while trying to piece together the script for this, a lot of what he heard was simply what you see. The wild and crazy side. As a result, what we&apos;re left with is not an accurate depiction of The Doors or of Jim Morrison. It is entertaining, yes, but it is not accurate. I think it could have been done perfectly, but it would have been excruciatingly difficult...and still not everyone would like it. And as far as the trippiness of the film, well that&apos;s Oliver Stone for you. We saw the same thing in Natural Born Killers a few years later. I personally like the style of it and felt that it was in place here but that&apos;s just my opinion. The &apos;60&apos;s, drugs, and rock and roll equals trippy.\n\nOverall a decent attempt at one of the most difficult subjects to cover, legends. And even though it&apos;s not entirely accurate and even though Morrison is one of my idols and he deserved a little better, I do enjoy the film greatly. The film should have been named Pandora&apos;s Box.",

      "reviewBody": "Honestly I had very low expectations for &quot;a complete unknown&quot;. Making a biopic about a person that&apos;s still alive, and such a specific and unique person as Bob Dylan had to have looked like nothing other than a caricature. But somehow Timothee transformed and became Dylan so organically and so effortlessly. The period of time when Dylan was in his early twenties, when the world was getting acquainted with him as well as he was with his own self was done well. I appreciated the humor in the script, our audience got in a few genuine laughs throughout the 2 hour run.\n\nMonica Barbaro playing Joan was a breath of fresh air! I hope she gets the praise she deserves for this and more opportunities in the future.\n\nElle Fanning was a slightly disappointing choice for a character based on Suze Rotolo who according to Bob was this breathtaking and striking woman. I didn&apos;t feel like Elle did her best work, she was too much Elle Fanning.\n\nHowever my favorite part must have been Edward Norton as Pete Seeger. I am unfamiliar with the real Pete Seeger so I cannot compare but Edward Norton did a fantastic job in the film.\n\nI will not likely see this film again, but walking out of the theater I had a nice aftertaste of the honor to legacy that Bob Dylan will leave (and already has) in this world. Timmy deserves an Oscar nomination and recognition for this role. I&apos;m very curious to compare this to the Bruce Springsteen biopic with Jeremy Allen White when it comes out.",

Unfortunately some people are bothered by the lead in the movie. But that&apos;s his job. And he did his job well. He was picked for a good reason. I would only be guessing why.

      "reviewBody": "In brief: &quot;A bit more cutesy than &quot;Kindergarten Cop,&quot; but more family-friendly, and Vin Diesel shows his versatility.&quot;\n\nI don&apos;t usually attend screenings for kids&apos; movies, but when I first found out about this film, I was very curious to see how Vin Diesel would do in a kid&apos;s film. I&apos;ve liked Vin Diesel ever since &quot;Pitch Black&quot;, and while some may dismiss him as a muscle-bound action workhorse, I&apos;ve long thought that there was more to him lurking behind that facade, and remembering the skepticism that greeted Arnold Schwarzenegger&apos;s attempts at comedyskepticism that was greeted with what I thought were successful turns in &quot;Twins&quot; and &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot;, I was curious to see how successfully Diesel would play against type.\n\nThe result is a family film more cutesy and farcical than &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot;, (the model my mind kept going back to for comparison), with an unfortunately greater focus on infant waste products, but greater conflict between Diesel and his young charges, which lends itself to more heartwarming moments of rapport-building. \n\nDiesel plays Lt. Shane Wolfe, a Navy SEAL assigned to protect the five children of a top scientist (Tate Donovan), and find a hidden computer program that may be secreted in his house while their mother (Faith Ford) and Wolfe&apos;s C.O. journey to Zurich to try and find the right code word for the scientist&apos;s safety deposit box. A simple assignment, it seems, except these kids have issues. Eldest son Seth is defiant, suffers bullying from fellow students and the school&apos;s V.P., and is negligent in his wrestling team responsibilities. Oldest daughter Zoe (&quot;American Dreams&quot;&apos;s Brittany Snow) is truant in her Driver&apos;s Ed class, and willfully disobedient. The problems of the youngest three, Lulu, Peter, and Tyler, seem simpler, but are no less mountainous for Wolfe, who first tries addressing these problems with the roughshod military discipline he&apos;s accustomed to, but soon finds himself changing tactics by listening to these kids&apos; problems, and helping them out more as a parent than a military bodyguard. Whereas Schwarzenegger&apos;s character was instantly ingratiated with the object of his protection in &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; by becoming friends and eventually boyfriend to his mom, and merely had to win his class&apos; attention, here Wolfe has the more difficult task of cutting through the layers of resentment in a pair of teenagers, taking care of an infant and two young children, and protecting them from assassins that come crashing through windows, which lends itself to both some genuinely warm moments when he opens up to Seth and Zoe, and some surprisingly interesting but funny action sequences that seem evocative of Jackie Chan, with a really nice setup-and-payoff when Wolfe realizes the secret to getting to the computer program.\n\nThis is obviously a film geared more for the kids, as evidenced by the kooky overacting, the silly Swiss stereotypes (which I didn&apos;t even realized existed), and the goofy actions on the part of the bad guys, such as the revelation, for example, that squirting a juice box into a bad guy&apos;s face is akin to spraying it with acid (and somehow keeps the bad guy from falling backward in response), but while that may be a let-down to the older folk, the parents will probably be pleased, since I recall some parents being upset with the more adult scenes in &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot;. \n\nThe bottom line is, bring the kids to see it, but if unless you&apos;re a die-hard Diesel fan, and want to see anything he does, it probably won&apos;t be your cup of tea if you&apos;re past grade school.",

      "reviewBody": "The British love a plucky loser. &quot;Eddie the Eagle&quot; tells the astonishing but true story of everyman plasterer Eddie Edwards who qualified for, and then competed in, the Calgary Olympics in 1988 (probably most famous for those other plucky losers – the Jamaican bobsleigh team of Disney&apos;s &quot;Cool Runnings&quot; fame). I have absolutely no idea how the traditionally more success-driven and competitive American audience will see it, but the packed English showing I attended all clearly loved this film as a feel-good classic.\n\nThe film starts with Eddie&apos;s childhood, struggling out of leg braces to try to pursue his Olympic dream with no success whatsoever. (Excellent performances here by brothers Tom and Jack Costello who set-up the tone for the film). His battle is not just against his lack of skill: whilst his mother (Jo Hartley) is quietly supportive, his father Terry (Keith Allen) is – not unreasonably it must be said – hugely frustrated at his son&apos;s fanciful ideas, wanting him to follow in the family plastering tradition with the same zeal. (The gulf in ambition is vast – Eddie: &quot;Didn&apos;t you have a dream when you were younger Dad?&quot;; Terry: &quot;Yes, plastering&quot;.)\n\nEventually Eddie finds a sport he is half decent in (by British standards!): downhill skiing, but is thwarted in following his Olympic dreams by smarmy and sneering Olympic selector Dustin Target, played by Tim McInnerny (from &quot;Black Adder&quot; and &quot;Notting Hill&quot; someone who has rather cornered the market on &apos;smarmy and sneering&apos;). It is then that he exploits ancient rules in the UK Olympic playbook to try to qualify in the discipline of ski-jumping: something no one has done since the 1920&apos;s. Linking up in Austria with an alcohol-infused coach and ex- jumper Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman), Eddie faces the terrors of the 40m and then 70m jumps to try to learn the sport (16 years too late).\n\nThis film has been long in gestation, with both Steve Coogan and Rupert Grint originally earmarked for the role. But Matthew Vaughn&apos;s involvement in the current project probably contributed to Taron Egerton getting the job following their work together on last year&apos;s &quot;Kingsman&quot;. And a great choice he is too. Almost unrecognizable from the sharp- suited Eggsy in &quot;Kingsman&quot; and gangster-sidekick Teddy in &quot;Legend&quot;, Egerton switches effortlessly between clueless goofball and steely determined sportsman. \n\nThe film&apos;s emotional heart though is with Hugh Jackman&apos;s side-story, battling with drink after throwing his own chance away with US-coach Warren Sharp (a nice cameo by Christopher Walken). Although going a little OTT at times (we see for example that he is no Meg Ryan!), Jackman provides a solid acting foundation that the rest of the cast can play off.\n\nRounding out the cast are solid performances from Jo Hartley (&quot;This is England&quot;) as Eddie&apos;s Mum, Mark Benton (&quot;Waterloo Road&quot;) as a BOA official, Rune Temte as a bear of a Norwegian coach and the ever-warming Jim Broadbent as a BBC commentator.\n\nAn &apos;attaboy&apos; should also go to the special effects crew headed up by Marty McLaughlin for making believe a man can fly. Whilst – you understand – not in any way doubting Jackman&apos;s ability to risk his pretty face on a 90m jump, the nighttime sequence of him doing that jump is really nicely executed (with cinematography by George Richmond).\n\nA quick browse at Wikipedia will make it clear that there has been a lot of license taken with this as a &quot;true story&quot;, and to be fair the prefix &quot;based on a..&quot; was used! And the film is not without irritations: Terry&apos;s negativity to his son&apos;s actions is about 25% overplayed in Simon Kelton&apos;s story, and the coach/protégé sub-plot has been overused in the past. The soundtrack (music) by Matthew Margeson is also rather grating particularly early on in the film: it is presumably going for &apos;period&apos; in its use of Hammond organ cheesiness, but that music was tiresome in the 80&apos;s too! Fortunately Margeson redeems himself with some kick-ass (no pun intended) classic 80&apos;s tracks neatly edited into the action.\n\nThese criticisms aside, I dare you to come out of this film without a silly grin on your face. I certainly did. Directed by Dexter Fletcher (&quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot;) it&apos;s not likely to win any Oscars, but in setting out to deliver what it said on the can it succeeded in all respects.\n\n(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version of this review.

      "reviewBody": "Every now and then, I read a review of a film which is so drastically different to my own reaction to it that I wonder if we have watched the same film. This is the case for almost EVERY review of &quot;Unfaithful&quot;. Aside from the occasional positive comment that I have read by other IMDB users, and the glowing review given by Margaret Pommeranz on the (Australian) &quot;Movie Show&quot; (four and a half stars, if I remember correctly), this film seems to have met with either negative or ambivalent reactions from everyone. And this surprises me immensely, because I was overwhelmed by it. I expected quite a good, slightly arty film with good performances (particularly from Diane Lane, who really impressed me in Coppola&apos;s &quot;The Cotton Club&quot;). What I got was a film which I think will be one of my favourites for many years to come.\n\nThe criticisms that I have read of &quot;Unfaithful&quot; don&apos;t confuse me because they disagree with me. I can accept that - no really, I can, although I don&apos;t see how anyone could miss the brilliant acting (one user comment said that any Hollywood actress could have done Diane Lane&apos;s performance - well, I DO look forward to the J.Lo remake in a few years), or the amazing photography, this being one of the most lush and seductive films I have seen in a long time. It&apos;s the way in which the reviewers have seemingly missed the entire point of the film, or fell asleep half-way through it.\n\nFirstly, I will concede that Connie&apos;s motivations were unclear (although I&apos;d call it subtlety, rather than poor scripting), but they weren&apos;t as unclear as many people would have you believe. Nor did Lyne simplify the relationship between Connie and Paul (someone called him Marcel - perhaps they DID watch another movie, or just couldn&apos;t spell his surname) - in fact, I would suggest that anyone who thought Connie was willing to sleep with the first guy she met would do well to rewatch this film and see the way that her mind works (or do you need a voice-over narration in addition to Lane&apos;s phenomenal performance?). In addition to this, I have read complaints about nudity (because apparently has no place in an erotic drama/thriller), technical problems (the reviewer who mentioned this loved the movie, but had issues with constant shots of the entire microphone, shots which he/she found very hard to ignore, but which I managed to miss completely) and the apparently &quot;cliched&quot; narrative. In response to the latter, I don&apos;t want to give anything away, but this film, although addressing a common topic (ie. adultery), is by no means a traditional Hollywood film, and certainly doesn&apos;t treat the topic in the same way that every other film has. Many may find the ending unfulfilling, but I can&apos;t comprehend the idea of it being cloying and unoriginal. And even if the narrative itself is conventional, the way in which it is handled by cast, director and technical crew (if you can forgive the microphone shots, I suppose) puts it so far above any of its counterparts as to warrant a much warmer reception than it seems to have been given.\n\nDiane Lane deserved the Oscar for this, without question. Unfortunately, her film came in a year when every single Best Actress nominee was of nearly equal quality. As you can see, I liked it - and wish that more people felt the same way about it. The only suggestion I can offer is that, if you have yet to see it, then don&apos;t go into it expecting a standard thriller - in fact, it can be quite slow-moving at times. But let it be what it is, because it does a damn good job at that.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Jackass the Movie&quot; defies just about every set law of film-making. It is rude, it is crude, and it is doggone hilarious. I can&apos;t really think of words to describe this film as none do so adequately. It is, of course, based upon the popular television show on MTV of the same name (except there&apos;s no &quot;the Movie&quot; on the end of it). Basically it is &quot;Candid Camera&quot; meets the X-Games meets drunkards. Its cast are a bunch of jackasses: Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Wee Man the Midget, Ryan Dunn, and Steve-O. They go around pulling various pranks, and sometimes - or most of the time - injuring themselves.\n\nThe humor is very selective - some will hate it and others (mainly stoned teens) will love it. Take, for instance, a gag where one of the men walks into a plumbing store and relieves himself into a display toilet. Things such as this have been insinuated before on a commercial I remember for Best Buy, but this movie shows everything - in detail - including the feces inside the toilet bowl.\n\nSound disgusting? Well it is. But some of the gags - for I can think of no other word to describe them - are just downright hilarious. For example, the co-creator of the TV series, Johnny Knoxville, borrows a car from a rental lot, takes it to a garage, has all the gears messed up and windows smashed, spray paints it, and then enters it into a car derby. He takes it back to the lot all smashed up and refuses to pay for the damage. He admits that he was drinking before it happened. He says they must help them pay for the damage to the vehicle. They point out that he signed a contract declaring that he would pay for all responsible damage, and he says, &quot;Yeah, but I had a little to drink when I signed that, too.&quot;\n\nThe cast and crew seem to have not grown past the age of 13 in terms of maturity. One of the best gags involves about four men on a golf course blasting air horns during tee-offs. One golfer gets so angered that he throws a golf club at them and starts to actually tee off at the men (who are hiding behind trees on the course).\n\nI&apos;ve never quite witnessed something like &quot;Jackass the Movie&quot; before. It is like a giant unedited TV show stretched out to a full 80 + minutes, and let me say that this is the first time in history I have seen a TV-show-based film that I thought was too short. (Movies like &quot;Night at the Roxbury&quot; seem to go on forever.) &quot;Jackass the Movie&quot; is lots of fun - it isn&apos;t deep or intellectual, but it&apos;s fun. \n\nThis film is definitely going to gross-out certain people, and enthuse the more wacky crowds out there. But it is one of the most &quot;technically&quot; entertaining films of the year. It isn&apos;t a masterpiece but it is very fun to watch. Maybe I&apos;m an immature sicko, but I liked this movie.\n\nBefore the film starts, there is a warning which reads something like &quot;the stunts performed herein are executed by trained professionals.&quot; Let me ask: How does one train to be a jackass? This film doesn&apos;t tell us, but it sure does show us what trained jackasses are like. And you know what? Being a jackass looks fun."

      "reviewBody": "Back in 1997, when I was still a carefree and stressless teenager, there suddenly came two volcano movies in one year. I enjoyed them both at the time, but all the critics and movie-going audiences unanimously claimed this &quot;Dante&apos;s Peak&quot; was much better than &quot;Volcano&quot;. They were right.\n\nNow that I re-watched them both again, shortly after one another, &quot;Dante&apos;s Peak&quot; is definitely the superior achievement, mainly thanks to the better and far more plausible script, but also the special effects are more splendid. What I also didn&apos;t realize in 1997, because I was too young and because I am European, is that &quot;Dante&apos;s Peak&quot; bears a lot resemblance with the factual events of the Mount St. Helens eruption as they occurred between end of March and mid-May 1980.\n\nNot only does director Roger Donaldson make use of the actual Mount St. Helens craters as filming locations, but there are also many parallels with the series of events as they took place in 1980. Similar to St. Helens, Dante&apos;s Peak is the name of a quiet and peaceful little town in Washington state, located at the bottom of a beautiful volcano that has been dormant for nearly 150 years, and believed to remain like that. One geologist/volcanologist also predicts the eruption and forewarns the local authorities, but hardly anybody takes him seriously. And, last but not least, here as well the human death toll unnecessarily increases because stubborn elderly people refuse to leave their mountaintop homes when the volcano erupts. By the way, if you enjoyed &quot;Dante&apos;s Peak&quot;, I warmly recommend seeking out the obscure 1981 disaster-movie &quot;St. Helens&quot; directed by Ernest Pintoff.",

Drishyam is a remake of the Malayalam movie by the same title. The movie is nestled in a Goan village, the kind where everyone knows one- another. The protagonist is a middle-class Goan Vijay Salgaonkar( Ajay Devgn) for whom his family&apos;s well being is paramount.\n\nAjay plays the role of a 5th class school-dropout who runs a local cable-service provider shop. He is a big movie-buff and spends most of his time at work looking at the motion pictures.  \n\nVijay has a cozy life with his wife Nandini(Shriya Saran) , elder daughter( Ishita Dutta, &apos;Poonam  from Ek Ghar Banaunga&apos;  &amp; Tanushree Dutta&apos;s sister) and younger daughter(Mrinal Jadhav).  The coziness of his family is shattered one night following an offhand chain of events.\n\nVijay&apos;s character development is myriad throughout the film and it compels you to think away from the extreme principles of black vs white,  right vs wrong, yin vs yang.  His strong will and steadfastness to protect his family at all costs forms the backbone of the story.\n\nThe unfateful night&apos;s chain of events leads to a massive police search headed by the stern and steely IPS Meera Deshmukh (Tabu).\n\nTabu&apos;s acting is top-notch in multiple interrogation  scenes throughout the movie with a distinct no-nonsense persona on display at all times.\n\nIshita Dutta is remarkable in her Bollywood debut with a wide palette of emotions. Mrinal Jadhav plays the role of the innocent and adorable younger daughter splendidly, generating a few interspersed audience laughs.\n\nRajat Kapoor has a knack for playing the upper-class, businessmen –roles and is casted perfectly as Tabu&apos;s husband. However his character is a bit monochromatic, probably due to the script.\n\nThe movie has multiple twists arousing the curiosity of the audience culminating into a superb climax.\n\nEven though the film is 2 hours and 43 minutes long, it binds the audience to their seats till the very last scene.\n\nI strongly recommend this film, especially to the thriller genre lovers.\n\nP.S. The film also teaches you why watching movies can impart you with paramount life-skills. So, definitely a connect with the movie buffs :)",

I could talk about the top-notch special effects of the time and the inclusion of Sean Connery and Dennis Quaid, who performed their roles of noble dragon and despairing knight incredibly well...I guess I just did...but I think there&apos;s something else about this film that needs mentioning.\n\nDragonheart is an incredibly uplifting film.  In a day when a lot of movies are chilling visions of the world around us, we need something to show us hope.  Dragonheart, with its tale of a knight who lost his faith and a dragon who was trying to restore his honor, paints a beautiful picture of kindness, friendship, love, and sacrifice that never fails to inspire me.  I am not a man given to displays of emotion, really...but the film makes me laugh and cry throughout everything.\n\nAnd the soundtrack certainly helps.  It is a textbook example of the proper use of a soundtrack to emphasize the plot and emotion.  The beautiful &quot;To the Stars&quot; remains one of my absolute favorite songs.  I can never listen to the soundtrack without seeing the movie happening again before my eyes.\n\nGet the movie.  And get the soundtrack.  You&apos;ll love them both.",

      "reviewBody": "TMNT 2: Out of the Shadows is a return to form for the turtles in a half shell, delivering a &quot;radical&quot; film full of energy, humor, and of course, pizza. This movie has a lot riding on it. Not only does director Dave Green have to right the wrongs of the first movie, but on top of that introduce new characters to the mix. First let&apos;s start with the positives. The actors playing the turtles shine again, playing off of each other brilliantly, making them all distinct and likable characters. Bebop and Rocksteady are great additions to the series,and feel pulled out right of the 80s cartoon. The CGI design and quality is noticeably improved, and the action sequences are well shot and fun to watch, especially one involving a Brazilian river and a tank. Megan Fox thankfully isn&apos;t given as much screen time as the first one and becomes a good side character that helps out when the script calls for it. And I have to mention the Kraang. They absolutely nailed it. Brad Garrett did a good job even though Pat Fraley is still my favorite. My only complaints are I wish the movie was longer, which would of helped give the film more room to breathe. I also felt Casey Jones and Shredder weren&apos;t used to their full potential. Despite this, I still found a ton of fun and respect towards the original 80s cartoon, and ask you to give this 2nd outing a chance, because nostalgia aside, this is, in my opinion, the first great TMNT movie.

This delightful throwback to the Tracy-Hepburn, Grant-Russell comedies of the 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s moves at a nice pace and is anchored by a razor sharp performance by Clooney, who has rarely been more appealing on screen. Clooney does everything right here and his performance alone makes this film worth seeing, but Zeta-Jones never allows herself to be overshadowed by him in one of her more venomous characterizations. Worthwhile bits are also contributed by Geoffrey Rush, Billy Bob Thornton, Richard Jenkins, and Edward Herrmann. One of the most underrated comedies ever made which is a definite must-see for Clooney fans.",

      "reviewBody": "The Ring was my favourite film of 2002, the best horror film I&apos;d seen in ages, and I subsequently saw and enjoyed (with the exception of Ring 0 - What the hell was that?) all the Japanese films as well.\n\nSo when I heard that the director of the original films was set to do the second &quot;remake&quot;, it was suitably excited. Imagine what he could do with a bigger budget and better technology? It is however, not even close to the first, and such improvements don&apos;t surface (same CGI, C-list Hallmark Channel cast). It does manage to keep you nervous throughout, but the proper scares are too infrequent and it appears to take itself too seriously. This is all too evident when the creepiest kid in cinema is admitted to hospital and The Ring 2 turns into a child abuse drama for around twenty minutes, leaving you wondering when it&apos;ll pick up a bit again.\n\nIt&apos;s also the kind of film that demands that you re-watch the first one before you go to see it; the opening makes no sense unless you&apos;ve seen &quot;Rings&quot; on the Collectors Edition DVD, and there&apos;s a ton of stuff that may have easily been forgotten if you saw the film three years ago.\n\nIt&apos;s alright; it&apos;s a horror sequel-remake thing, so you don&apos;t expect too much and you wont be disappointed, but you can&apos;t help but think it could have been done a bit better.",

      "reviewBody": "First off, I enjoyed the movie as a strict action/detective flick. Wahlberg is likeable in just about everything he does. Alan Arkin as Henry Cimoli was perfect. Iliza Schlesinger as Cissy was sexy (those breasts!) and comical. Her standup gets annoying so keeping her screen time to a minimum in this move was a good choice. Winston Duke didn&apos;t do much with the character of Hawk other than looking imposing because he was big, not because he oozed menace. Still, it was a fun action movie that moved along at a brisk pace and had lots of great action scenes.\n\nHowever, this version of Spenser has next to nothing to do with the book or TV series character other than his name. I&apos;m not sure I understand why they bothered calling it Spenser if they changed everything about the character. The series ended over 30 years ago so its not its not like it had great name recognition. They could have called it Joe Confidential and it would have had the same impact. Spenser was a renaissance man. He was streeet smart, suave, quoted literature, was a gourmet cook, had a moral code, was loyal to his girlfriend (Susan; a college professor) and was kicked off the force for being a smartass and not blindly following bad rules, and never went to jail. Hawk and he met as young boxers and went their separate ways, one into law enforcement and one into the criminal life. They crossed paths many times, but respected each other, even if it meant squaring off against each other. Its what made their relationship special. Its why I gave the movie a chance, to see if they explored their earlier life together. I guess it did that, but they went for the cheap character development in favor or more smash ups and fist fights. Wahlberg and Duke as roommates at Henry&apos;s place was just lame writing. There was so much fertile ground that could have been covered here and they blew it.\n\nAs I said in the first paragraph, it was an enjoyable movie, but it didn&apos;t do anything to distinguish it from every other action film that gets made these days. Spenser is a unique character with such a rich background and that was just ignored for more set pieces.",

It is sung very well in Spanish early in the course of the movie with no translation but is tone setting for the movie. Used again in the credits.\n\nAt just over 2 hours, this movie seemed to drag at some points and several scenes could have been edited down a wee bit. Don&apos;t need to see something for 30 seconds or 2 minutes when the point is made and understood in considerably less time.\n\nI don&apos;t see any academy nods for this one nor would I have expected any for this genre of movie but it was an enjoyable movie for an evening.\n\nMy wife and son were there and enjoyed it as well.",

Based on a true story, it paints a vivid picture not only of the Amazonian region which Percy Fawcett and his men set out to explore, but also of the Western society they came from, but in a fairly balanced way - this didn&apos;t feel like another case of &apos;weren&apos;t Western white people before 1980 all absolutely dreadful&apos; but rather a portrayal of a society with its own beliefs and attitudes (as all societies have) faced with the prospect of discovering another, much older, civilisation.\n\nThis wouldn&apos;t be a film for fans of action movies as such. Instead it offers a fascinating study of place, society and the often slow and hazardous process of discovery and its effect on the people - all of the people - involved.",

      "reviewBody": "Hostiles is a quite interesting western that convinces with stunning landscapes, intriguing characters and strong acting performances. The movie has a quite slow pace, so don&apos;t expect a vivid American or Italian western from the fifties and sixties. This movie is a drama above all, situated in a historically intriguing period between the American Civil War and the emergency of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe story revolves around Captain Joseph Blocker, who has lost many friends and brothers in arms in battles against Apaches and who openly despises them. He tracks them down pitilessly and tells himself that he is doing his duty while people around him start becoming depressed and disillusioned. One day, a colonel gives him a final order before his retirement,direct from the President. Joseph Blocker must escort a dying Cheyenne Chief, his personal arch enemy, as well as his family back to their tribal lands as a sign of reconciliation with the First Nations. The captain, who has always obeyed orders, is about to refuse but is menaced and forced to cooperate. He gathers a few faithful brothers in arms and must also cooperate with some inexperienced rookies around him to go on this dangerous trip. On the way from New Mexico to Montana, the unusual group faces numerous challenges as they face difficult weather conditions, a hostile Comanche party and racist landowners among others. They are joined by numerous other intriguing characters such as a mentally unstable woman who has lost her entire family to the Apaches and a former brother in arms of the captain who is about to be hanged. However, their biggest challenge is to fight their inner demons and overcome their differences in order to survive in hostile territory.\n\nThe movie finds the right balance between violent sequences that focus on the witnesses&apos; reactions rather than graphic elements and clever dialogues between the diversified cast of characters. The most fascinating character is Captain Joseph Blocker, who seems to be a pitiless racist at first sight but who turns out to be a man with a strong moral compass who goes through a coming-of-age on this fateful journey and ends up not only forgiving the Indians for killing his partners but even empathizing and sympathizing with them, ending up defending them beyond duty. His positive development exemplifies the difficult relationship between European settlers and America&apos;s First Nations and is ultimately a sign of forgiveness, hope and peace. This positive moral contrasts the quite sinsiter mood of the film with an elevated body count and sensitive topics such as depression, revenge and suicide as many characters shatter under the burden of the challenging order.\n\nHostiles is a film that needs some patience and time to unfold but ends up being particularly rewarding thanks to the strong moral behind the sinister mask. Christian Bale, one of the world&apos;s greatest actors, even delivers the best performance of his career as tough anti-hero with just as many flaws as strengths. Above all, Hostiles is a film that is profoundly human, in all its sickening darkness interrupted by some rays of light. The perfect ending exemplifies this mixture perfectly. Western and drama fans should experience this film at the cinema and fans of Christian Bale just can&apos;t get around this movie either. Hollywood should produce more westerns and less superhero movies.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is okay, it did not provide me much excitement. It is a noir-love story buried inside a heist movie inside an action film.\n\nHowever the movie is more interesting for everything that surrounds it rather than what happens in it. It is funny to see how similar it is to the Oceans&apos; movie. They share all the same ingredients, except for the brutal violence that is in this movie. But the rest is pretty much on point, the camera work, the music, the dialog, the characters, even the tone with the witty funny light hearted lines.\n\nThe actors are what elevates the film : the plot is very simple but it has this old-school-hustlers charm to it. The film has flashbacks and attempts to do non-linear storytelling, but it is not necessary, the characters actions drive the movie.\n\nGeorge Clooney is suave robber Jack Foley, a character that is suave and cool, but not too much. He is street-wise and self-aware, he is the thief with a heart of gold. He is smart but that does not prevent him to fail in almost any of his schemes. We root for him not only because he his cool but also because the odds are against him. A character so efficient so relatable, so compelling that it will be the basis for glamour-superstar Danny Ocean.\n\nJennifer Lopez is young try-hard Jennifer Lopez. It is endearing to see the freshness and naivete of her character. She is basically the female love interest and her role revolves around being obsessed with Clooney. Again the contrast modern Jlo is the most enjoyable.\n\nDon Cheadle plays the over-the-top villain. It works because is roughness and brutality play off against Clooney&apos;s smoothness.\n\nThe heist barely matters really, and that is where the film achieves balance. The universe is grounded and realistic (very violent and raw), but the characters effortlessly glide through it. I think that it gives the edge that was lacking in the Oceans&apos; and therefore made those movies rely more heavily on swagger and bravado rather than charm and wit. In Ocean&apos;s the world is effortless and cool and suave, the characters are cool and effortless and suave : it deflates the tension somewhat. In Oceans defence, it make the film more palatable for the mainstream. This film on the other hand cannot really escape its genre. It stays in the bounds of the action movie.\n\nThis movie really acts a stepping stone for Clooney : it is part Dusk Till Dawn with the gruesome crime story and part Ocean&apos;s Eleven with the light hearted heist with no stakes. The movies sexuality is also somewhat interesting. It is very difficult to watch in a post-me-too world. But in a strange way, it reinforce the overall sexual violence that the film portrays. All in all it is a reflection of its era. I believe it stands next to Heat, Reservoir Dogs and others as part of the 90s golden age of heist-movies. The lost art of a simpler time.\n\nAlso the best-scene of the film is when a van drives up a snow-covered alley. The mesmerizing way the tires plow through the fresh snow is something I don&apos;t recall having seen in film. (Was it special effects ? was it one take ? we may never know)",

      "reviewBody": "Director James Ponsoldt&apos;s The Circle depicts the story of a not-so-distant future, or perhaps an alternative present, in which one company dominates digital media, data gathering, and surveillance services. Based upon the four-year-old novel by author Dave Eggers, you&apos;ll notice some stark similarities between this motion picture narrative and the smash hit TV series Black Mirror. The biggest difference between the two is that The Circle is fast-faced and poorly written whereas Black Mirror is a slow-burning but well-written anthology series. In addition to the similarities between the aforementioned, there are certainly elements of The Truman Show in this movie as well. With a powerhouse cast, brilliant composer (Danny Elfman), and excellent editing, The Circle appears to have what a blockbuster needs; however, the hollow characters, poor character development, fractured subplots, and overall diegesis hold the film back from reaching the impact that it could have had. Having taken a digital media and privacy class in graduate school, and published a few articles, this is a film that I was looking forward to in order to analyze how the social commentary or commentary on the human condition regarding reasonable expectations of privacy and big data were integrated into the plot. Sadly, the screenplay was not strong or developed significantly enough to provide big data and privacy discussions.\n\nMae Holland (Emma Watson) hates her job at the water company, so she is incredibly excited when her friend Annie (Karen Gillan) lands Mae an interview at The Circle, the world&apos;s most powerful technology and social media company. Mae&apos;s fear of unfulfilled potential impresses the recruiters at The Circle and she lands the opportunity of a lifetime. After Mae puts herself into harm&apos;s way but rescued, thanks to The Circle&apos;s newest surveillance and data gathering system, she is encouraged by the company founder Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) to take a more active role in technology development by participating in an experiment that puts Mae&apos;s life on display for the world (in the vein of The Truman Show) to see. Once Mae turns on that camera, she has more &quot;friends&quot; than she ever imagined and becomes an instant online celebrity. Unfortunately, this decision will affect those closest to Mae and the negative ramifications will reach far beyond her inner circle and begin to impact humanity at large. Sometimes, people just don&apos;t want to be found or be &quot;social.&quot;\n\nFor all The Circle has going for it, the weak screenplay keeps it from being the blockbuster that it so desperately wants to be. A great movie typically begins with solid writing, and that is what&apos;s missing here. After five minutes (or so it seems) of opening title logos, perhaps that is indirect evidence that there were just too many hands in the pot, each trying to take the movie&apos;s narrative in a different direction. Much like Frozen plays off like two different movies crudely sewn together, The Circle appears to be one movie for the first two acts, but takes an unexpected and unfulfilling turn in the third. A couple of conspicuous unanswered questions come after Mae meets TrueYou designer and founder Ty (John Boyega). He designed the platform that launched The Circle. At one point he asks Mae to meet him in a secret tunnel (where all the servers are stored) and tells her that &quot;it&apos;s worse than I thought.&quot; Great opportunity to introduce intrigue, suspense, and more. The problem is that the audience is never told what Ty finds or what happens with what he found. You can remove that whole subplot and the movie remains the same. There are other subplots that are nicely introduced, but never carried out as well. Any or all of them can be removed and the film proceeds the same. Not good. If you can remove several subplots or unfulfilled turning points and the film&apos;s diegesis remain largely untouched, then you have poor writing. The third act in and of itself leaves audiences with a hurried ending that does little to provide closure to the narrative; however, it does support the film&apos;s circular logic and irony. Hardly satisfying.\n\nIn terms of the allegory here, The Circle is a Google-like company with Apple&apos;s technology. Eamon Bailey is a Steve Jobs type innovator with characteristics of Mark Zuckerberg and Google&apos;s Eric Schmidt. Thankfully, The Circle does not represent any one company, but rather combines all the most notable innovations and technological achievements of Google, Apple, Facebook, Instagram, and more into one globally dominating company. Antitrust issues are introduced early on, but again, that&apos;s never fully developed. The movie highlights many issues faced by private citizens, governments, and digital data driven companies today; therefore, it sets the foundation for a movie that could have been thought-provoking, but the writing hinders that ability. The irony in the movie is for every digital answer to streamlining services or bolstering conveniences, a little privacy is eroded each time. Pretty soon, if one shares enough information, the idea of privacy is extinct. Privacy was central to the plot, but it just wasn&apos;t handled in the most effective way. Concepts such as &quot;off the grid,&quot; self-proclaimed &quot;celebrity,&quot; and &quot;calls to action&quot; are displayed and discussed in the film, connecting this augmented reality to real-world issues each of us encounter or think about. One particularly interesting theme in the movie is deep friendship. Unfortunately, this was not fully fleshed as is the case with most of the movie; but still, it does get touched upon.\n\nIf you were hoping for another film like the brilliant Social Network, then you will undoubtedly be disappointed. Films such as The Circle should be memorable, but unfortunately this one is very much forgettable. Coincidentally, the movie itself is as hollow as the plot and characters.\n\nWritten by R.L.

There is quirkiness, sometimes it reminded me of Wes Anderson&apos;s movies, like &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel.&quot; The character played by Christian Bale, a disheveled doctor who lost an eye in the war, reminded us of Peter Faulk&apos;s 1970s TV series Columbo in his mannerisms and his quest to find out facts.\n\nWhile this is almost entirely a fictional story it is loosely based on something that was called &quot;The Business Plot.&quot; Roosevelt was newly elected and a group of businessmen didn&apos;t like the direction things were headed. So they hatched a plan to overthrow the President.\n\nBut very little of the running time is actually devoted to that, most of it has the three main characters, accused of murdering a woman by pushing her into the street to be run over by a delivery truck, working to prove their innocence and to focus in on the real bad actors.\n\nMy wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library, a totally interesting and entertaining take on the times."

      "reviewBody": "Fifty years ago, Toni Servillo wrote a novel. It was praised, won an award, and he came to Rome and got caught up in the party set. He earns a living as an interviewer. Occasionally he is asked why he never wrote another novel, and he offers various, patently untrue reasons. Now his first love, whom he has not seen in more than forty years, has died. He turns thoughtful. He remains amused by the circus of the party set, but shreds their pretensions with a few well chosen words. He is obviously suffering a spiritual crisis, but when he tries to seek advice from a cardinal who is said to be next in line for the Papacy, the man walks away.\n\nThe obvious move to compare this to is Fellini&apos;s 8½, but I see its roots in Samuel Pepys&apos; dictum that &quot;when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.&quot; Servillo is not tired of life, but he is tired of this life, and sees death coming for him. He is perfect in the role.\n\nWriter-director Paolo Sorrentino fills the screen with beautifully shot images: the overblown spectacle of the party set trying to amuse themselves, and the quiet beauty of the old Rome, its bridges, the shores, the Colisseum across the street from Servillo&apos;s apartment, the remembered image of his first love. It&apos;s a rich, beautiful, thoughtful, wistful movie.",

      "name": "a good film but lacks depth and historical context",
      "reviewBody": "Well-acted across the board, I loved the Patricia Clarkson-Robert Downey combo so much that I kind of wish they had their own movie. Stylish and effective cinematography- the darting to and fro, the perpetual smoke, the use of shadow and silhouette. All very well done. And the overall message of the film- that the media and the American public need to wake the *beep* up and pay attention- is one that I heartily commend.\n\nPart of my problem with the film stems from the fact that I am a history student with a keen interest in the time period. And Clooney does nothing to place his story in historical context. He&apos;s just taking pieces of a story and expecting the audience to fill in the rest. Like the loyalty oath piece. It really has nothing to do with the rest of the film. It is not explored further in any other scene. It is not really debated. Just one scene, designed to get the audience to recoil and say &quot;wasn&apos;t that horrible?&quot; Then it&apos;s not mentioned again. No reference to Stalin...hell, no reference to the Cold War, the atomic bomb, the Korean War, or even any aspect of the Red Scare other than McCarthy. There&apos;s one line about Alger Hiss near the end, but it provides little context or explication. The film makes it seem like McCarthy was a one-man wrecking crew instead of a particularly ruthless and ambitious politician taking advantage of a fear that was already widespread and deeply penetrating.\n\nAnd loyalty oaths still exist, by the way, and the truth is that for the most part we accept them. I had to sign a loyalty oath to be a public schoolteacher.\n\nAs for the idea that Clooney is trying to make commentary about how society has changed in the past 50 years, I agree that such is his intent. In this regard he is clearly inspired by Todd Haynes&apos; Far From Heaven, which his company produced and which he vigorously promoted. But Haynes does it much more elegantly. He shows his characters confounding their stereotypical roles; Clooney merely reinforces them. I wanted to see Patricia Clarkson&apos;s character do something other than fetch newspapers. I wanted to see a black character do something other than belt out jazz tunes that lay out the plot like something in an old musical. Otherwise, their presence smacks of tokenism, of the worst kind of liberal condescension. Also, Haynes&apos; film is a fiction commenting on the fictional representations and actual reality of a bygone era. Clooney&apos;s is, at least in its central scenes, practically a documentary. Having subplots whose primary purpose is smug contemporary commentary detracts from the versimilitude.\n\nThe scene near the end in the office between Langella and Strathairn is the thematic lynchpin of the film. However, this is where I think Clooney most clearly falls short. It seems to me that they address Murrow&apos;s earlier complicity in the Red Scare (re:Alger Hiss) surreptitiously by burying it in a set of defensive comments that are presented like a bunch of excuses for the network&apos;s moral cowardice. It&apos;s scripted in such a way that Murrow does not have to respond. As for the idea that corporations run the media for profit and that the nightly news is more distraction than edification ...well, that was a bold statement when Network came out 30 years ago, not so much now anything more than stating the obvious. I wanted more from this.\n\nI almost feel like Clooney was torn between making a documentary and making something truly scathing in the Network vein. As documentary the film is brought down by its lack of context, which is a shame because Strathairn&apos;s line readings are chillingly good. As social commentary the film simply doesn&apos;t say anything particularly perceptive, and at times it comes across as liberal bourgeois moralizing.",

      "reviewBody": "Finally.....\n\nThrough this autumn&apos;s movie mediocrity, comes a fresh, fun and deliciously wicked movie by acclaimed actor/director Griffin Dunne.  I must first point out that I did not read the book... and also that I am male (drawing attention to this fact since most of my male friends would not be caught DEAD in a male-bashing, chick flick dark comedy that reeks in the celebration of womankind!)\n\nSondra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are devilishly sexy as the spell-casting sisters doomed to be single for the rest of their natural life... and Stockard Channing and Diane Weist are also enchanting as their aunts that have raised them on chocolate cake and midnight margaritas!  Aidan Quinn rounds out the superb cast as a detective determined to find out the truth behind the disappearance of a wanted killer.\n\nWith a terrific soundtrack and an equally impressive musical score, Practical Magic will surprise and delight many a filmgoer who delves into the fantasy and fun of being bewitched!"

      "reviewBody": "Thank god for swades. Its been ever so often that as Indians we have lamblasted the mushy, one track nonsensical movies that were being churned out by bollywood and yearned for something slightly honest and celebral. And now it seems that the moment has arrived. Swades has finally reached the next level of Indian movie-making with the help of ashutosh, srk and rahman where the execution, the concept and the treatment of the film is at least (i can safely assume) close to world standards. There is no point comparing lagaan (the directors 1st movie) to this movie as his earlier venture was purely fiction with no semblance of realism in it. However this movie has so many ingredients of being a pathbreaker for Indian cinema that its almost scary. The feelings and expectations of an nri set aside, it tells the story of middle and upper class India losing touch with the harsh realities of the sufferings of the less fortunate ones all around us (and the fact that we can do very little to change the ongoing scenario is even more glaring and painful). Besides this the movie also deals with the desires and priorities of humans inspite of the trials and tribulations of daily living.\n\nThe maturity of the script, the actors and the score makes it a journey of epic proportions without it looking epic at all. The normalcy of the movie is something which might (and hopefully will) change the way cinema is seen and made in India in the future. One can only hope.",

The film delves into class division, corporate greed, and societal collapse. It features a bleak, post-apocalyptic setting and focuses on human survival and morality. The zombies, while retaining their classic slow, shambling nature, exhibit increased intelligence and coordination. The film blends horror with social critique, though some reviewers feel the commentary is more overt and less subtle than in earlier films.",

      "name": "For me, it&apos;s definitely the worst of the Living Dead films and ruins Romero&apos;s otherwise solid track record in the zombie genre.",
      "reviewBody": "Rating: * 1/2 out of **** \n\nLand of the Dead has been long-awaited for a good two decades. Set presumably some time after Day of the Dead, the plot focuses on a human population that has managed to survive by barricading themselves within the &quot;remains&quot; of Pittsburgh by means of guards and electrified fences (as well as rivers that are bordering the city). The rich reside in a tower called Fiddler&apos;s Green but everyone else is forced to live in the streets, with only the false hope of being able to attain high-class status.\n\nOne guy dissatisfied with living in the streets, Cholo (John Leguizamo), doesn&apos;t take kindly to the mayor&apos;s (Dennis Hopper) refusal, especially having been his lackey for three years with the expectation of reward. So Cholo steals the armored vehicle Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy Fiddler&apos;s Green unless he gets his five million dollars (which is the amount needed to get high-class status, but did he really expect to be welcomed into Fiddler&apos;s Green with open arms after this incident?). Refusing to cooperate, the mayor hires Riley (Simon Baker) to bring Dead Reckoning back. Meanwhile, the undead are planning to invade the city thanks to the evolving zombie called Big Daddy, and given this couldn&apos;t happen at a worst possible time, you can guess what&apos;ll happen next.\n\nI&apos;m going to put it bluntly, this film is by far the worst of Romero&apos;s zombie movies, lacking in so many ways that I would still feel the same way even if I didn&apos;t have its predecessors to compare it with. But there are its predecessors, and having already seen three prior films in which characters must hold off scores of zombies at bay from inside some &quot;safe&quot; location before it&apos;s ultimately penetrated by the undead, let&apos;s just say seeing this a fourth time gets a little repetitive.\n\nThe film does have elements worth appreciating, the cinematography is excellent and easily the best of the series; I especially loved the stylish and creepy nighttime shot of zombies shuffling within a fog-shrouded forest. The movie is also the most action-packed of the series, so the non-stop gunfire keeps the movie watchable. The production values are also pretty good considering the budgetary limitations (some of the f/x still look pretty weak, though).\n\nOtherwise, LOTD is rushed, unfulfilling, and does little its predecessors haven&apos;t already accomplished. What new material it does aim for is poorly conceived, a shocker considering Romero&apos;s had twenty years to mull over this material. Take the city, for instance, it&apos;s never fully explained how the monetary system works or where the electricity is coming from. I was able to suspend my disbelief for the latter in Dawn of the Dead, but I&apos;m not willing to let Romero pull the same trick twice, especially when the inner workings of the city should have been further explored. \n\nThe movie&apos;s social commentary feels like a slapdash effort of contemporary issues tossed together without any real coherency, with characters acting in blatantly idiotic fashion for no other purpose than to continue serving the commentary. The original Dawn of the Dead&apos;s commentary on consumerism worked because it was a natural outgrowth of the way the characters&apos; believably behaved (if you had free reign to a mall, you likely wouldn&apos;t want to leave, would you?).\n\nYet here, Romero feels compelled to ensure that Hopper&apos;s character won&apos;t dare negotiate, even preferring to leave the city (to go where exactly?) and kill an associate rather than give up five million bucks. To keep the commentary going, Romero even has Hopper take all his cash with him, even though I had to wonder what it was good for. Considering his demands, the same problem also applies to Cholo. Are there other cities/outposts out there using the same currency as well? If so, why not at least mention it so we don&apos;t question the characters&apos; motivations, especially considering it&apos;s the basic framework that leads to so many deaths later in the film.\n\nThere are further instances of stupidity, such as Riley choosing not to warn anyone inside the city about Big Daddy. The soldiers protecting the city prove incompetent in almost every fashion, with one guard actually rappelling into a crowd of zombies. Later in the film, there&apos;s even a guy who wears headphones while he&apos;s outside the city, by himself, and not at all far from known zombie territory. This scene is also indicative of the countless jump scares Romero attempts, all of them obvious and hilariously overdone.\n\nAs for the zombies, there&apos;s the storyline involving Big Daddy, an undead gas station attendant who&apos;s inexplicably getting smarter. Much of the appeal of zombies is seeing them act out as mindless drones with no other motivation than to eat human flesh. That Big Daddy is able to think and seems to actually want revenge for his fallen zombie brethren completely mutes the sense of dread and terror that came with zombies acting on just pure instinct. \n\nMost astoundingly, Romero takes this a step further and actually wants us to sympathize with the zombies. I shouldn&apos;t be surprised by this development, as it&apos;s all been clearly leading up to this point since Bub&apos;s humanity in Day of the Dead and the constant &quot;they&apos;re us, we&apos;re them&quot; lines. Doesn&apos;t mean I have to like it, especially when the previous installments have made it clear being a zombie isn&apos;t something to cherish and the general fact that they like to eat people doesn&apos;t exactly make me want to side with them. For me, LOTD continues Romero&apos;s downward spiral, and I still haven&apos;t liked a movie of his since the 80s."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s quite unusual for a writer to adapt its own book to the screen, especially when it&apos;s a comic-book (well, Frank Miller&apos;s done it, but that&apos;s another story), and especially when it&apos;s an autobiographical comic book. That&apos;s the originality of this movie, which is the adaptation of a autobiographical graphic novel by its very author. &quot;Persepolis&quot; deals with the life, and especially the youth of Marjane Satrapi, in Iran, during the reign of the Shah and the Islamic revolution. But if the memories could be easily told alone in front of a blank paper, isn&apos;t it harder to be true and sincere when you are surrounded by a all animation crew ?\n\nThat&apos;s the great achievement of the movie : to be true to the comics and therefor, to the life of Marjane. The best parts of it are all about her personal relations, with her grandmother or her uncle. You really have the feeling that she relates all this events to praise their memories and who they were. On the other side, the political scenes and historical point of view that supposedly are the goal of the movie seem to me a little less good than the family or personal souvenirs. It may be true but it seems a little bit simple and even cliché sometimes (see for instance the history of the Shah for all audiences). The personal view on the repercussion of the Islamic repression is way better than this kind of big exposes. The death of a young man trying to escape the police after a party or the attitude of a man insulting her mother in a parking tells us more about the regime in Iran than the speech the movie sometimes (but not so often) gives us.\n\nSo, paradoxically, the more personal the movie gets, the truer it is. The all rapport the difficulties to left your country and to adapt to another world seems for instance very honest and touching. The childhood period, told in a comic strip style is both funny and melancholic. In the end, this movie is far from being a movie about Iran, but only tells an individual life, crying for freedom in a country were a woman can&apos;t reach it, but transfigured by personal memories and a strong animated point of view, that uses all the techniques and styles a comic-book adaptation could offer.",

They didn&apos;t, but I think that might have worked too.\n\nDiscussing the movie with my twenty-something son, I brought up the &quot;why remake a nearly perfect film&quot; question and his response was ... for a new generation. People his age were never going to see the 1961 version in the theater and most would never see a 60 year old movie at all. This movie allows a new generation (or two or three) to experience the magic on the big screen. Ultimately, the appeal of the movie lies in the music and the dance ... even more than the story. But the story is still powerful even after there have been so very many Romeo and Juliet adaptations.\n\nA fun movie to see on the big screen.",

It was a hard time to fit in, but a fun time, like most teenagers, I had these fantasies that this movie reflects on.  I can not believe they got Wes from the Road Warrior to do a part.  The scene where the computer animated women talks to Michael Halls parent is hilarious, but sick.  The stuff going out of the chimney, the MX missile, and the kitchen turning blue is funny.  Bill Paxion or chet is a classic wait and see what happens to him.  Anyways rent it live it and be it! 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve played football at every level and nearly every professional football league possible for the last 20 years of my life and trust me when I say this movie is a MUST SEE!! After watching &quot;Concussion&quot; with my son on Christmas day I had an epic awakening of common sense. The movie hit home so hard for me that I will no longer support the game of football. I will not play, coach, or watch it again until overall awareness and change is set in place for the affects of playing the game to be accounted for in some kind of way on a large scale. I have played this game for the last 20 years of my life and have physically felt the affects of it more and more each year. If you have played this game you know the &quot;SuperMan&quot; like culture that comes with it. How it is a sin to get hurt or say &quot;I have a headache&quot;. I will no longer turn a blind eye to the long term affects of ignoring the phrase. What the normal fan or anyone who hasn&apos;t played the game at a high level doesn&apos;t know is the stress and depression that comes with leaving the game. I&apos;d equate it to being the same as losing a spouse of 30+ years but add 100 blows to the head every day of each year. You already feel lost and meaningless but you also have years of brain damage which inflates the process. I grew up with a love for football because of its culture, all the great things it taught me, and the qualities it brought out of me and my &quot;brothers&quot;, my teammates. BUT all of that is not worth my life after football. The fact of the matter is we as a society have turned a blind eye to the long term affects of playing football and I refuse to be a part of the problem any longer. This movie is not as visually gripping as it could have been and it also doesn&apos;t expand anywhere near as far as it could have on the obvious occurrence of brain injuries throughout every level of the sport but it gets right to the point and it shines light on the facts. The sport isn&apos;t going anywhere safe until the NFL does and the NFL has not and probably will not because of money. If change in the sport is going to occur it has to start at the top. After watching this movie every parent has to question if they want their child to participate in this sport. For me and my children, it&apos;s a definite &quot;No-Brainer&quot;.",

This is strictly a comedy - there&apos;s no deep soul searching here, the analyst is also in it for comedy value.\n\nThe story is funny and lively, the soundtrack reminded us that not all 80&apos;s music was rubbish and the whole feel of the film is one that it must have been fun to make.  John Cusack is excellent as the hitman, he just seems to bring the character to life and play him in a jokey way without making fun of the film, Dan Akroyd gets the best role he&apos;s had in years as the hitman trying to get Cusack to join his union, while Minnie Driver is girly and fun - the whole cast are excellent in fact!\n\nThe film is not a classic by any means and many see it as a down side that it ignores any serious issues or that the film is set so far away from reality but for me this is part of the fun.  Sit down, don&apos;t take it seriously and just enjoy the ride!"

Personally, Natassia Malthe looked so much better than Jennifer Garner, plus she actually looked more like the Elektra character from the comics. The directing was also alright. Some scenes just seemed dead, others just to fill up time, though funnily it seemed to go by quickly. The final fight just came like that. I was there thinking &quot;dont tell me the climax is coming already&quot;, did the climax fight deliver? No, not really, but was still amusing to watch though. Overall this is an above average film except from those minor issues i addressed, and is a better movie than Catwoman, but, what isn&apos;t? 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the good ones. However it reflects as much the passion and skill of Hayao Miyazaki as his old age confusion. His latest &quot;last movie&quot; starts one way and ends (abruptly) another. It has elements from his own life, his previous work and some new ideas, but the gist of the film is reconciling with loss and moving forward, recognizing there isn&apos;t much one can do. A very old man mentality in a movie about a child entering a magical world filled with wonder and dream logic.\n\nThe animation was so beautiful, the story a bit disjointed, but quite captivating. It was the ending that kind of disappointed. This film has been a long time in the making (in 2019 it was 15% complete, allegedly, with Miyazaki directing a minute of the film a month) and it shows.\n\nThe Japanese title is &quot;How do you live?&quot;, the same as the Genzaburo Yoshino&apos;s instructional coming-of-age novel that Miyazaki&apos;s mother gifted him. In the film, the boy finds the book with a message from his dead mother, instructing him to read it, but it never goes anywhere. There are a lot of other hints and symbols that are quite opaque to non-Japanese, so I felt that I&apos;ve missed chunks of what the movie was supposed to convey.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting quality of the film is how easily it can be interpreted multiple ways, the ambiguity both confusing and thought provoking. As we experience dream and child logic we get a glimpse of the transmuted reality underneath. The grief, the loss, the benevolent yet oppressive culture, the futility and pain of war, the missing and missed parenting and so on.\n\nBottom line: is it a masterpiece or a slice of Miyazaki, jumbled beyond recognition? Both. I felt it might be a fitting farewell film, but also that I missed so many meanings from it. I liked it.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\n&quot;Big Eyes&quot; (2014) is more of good feel comedy drama then a serious biography drama as it&apos;s genre indicates. Yes, it is based on a very true story, but this is not a typical biopic by any means. It&apos;s a &quot;light&quot; and easy movie, with some great performances by both leads, tight pacing, very nice writing and directing. No wonder that it was mentioned in an Comedy or Musical categories at Golden Globes and not in motion picture drama.\n\nOverall, this is true very well made biography drama about some painters and frauds. Won&apos;t going to spoil anything, just going to say that i was very surprised by the ending when i find out that this actually happen, well, probably not word by word but the outcome did happen actually how it was portrait in the movie. This is a very fine picture from legendary director Tim Burton, and safe to say that this is his best movie in years simply by not being &quot;a Tim Burton&apos;s&quot; movie as we know them. This small budget picture (in terms of other&apos;s T.Burton&apos;s flicks) actually is much more lovely and intimate then his recent works. I will go even so far and say that i haven&apos;t enjoy his movie so much since 1999&apos;s &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Recently seeing a trailer for a remake of this iconic but somewhat forgotten 90&apos;s film made me realise the original was long overdue a rewatch.\n\nIt is more than just a sports film, it&apos;s a an evolution of the &apos;buddy&apos; movies and &apos;odd couple&apos; movies of 80&apos;s (think Lethal Weapon, Stir Crazy, Twins, Trading Places). So in effect it is about the relationship, and the chemistry between Snipes and Harrelson is excellent. You really feel for each character in their highs and especially lows throughout the movie, and wonder how they will scrape themselves out the next scam they create.\n\nThe games scenes are really well shot with slo-mo action of the actors doing some cool skills and plays on the court, making me wonder how long they trained at basketball to prepare for this film!? The comedy element does not get overlooked either and the banter between the two leads is especially fun and does not feel forced. Also worth a mention is the scene of the store hold up robbery which is a genuinely funny moment.\n\nOn the downside, It does feel a little dated now, from the court fashion to the scenes of the tough neighbourhoods and the assorted hustlers and gangs, you don&apos;t get the impression of any true danger to the interlopers. Also some of the stereotypes are quite cliched, but then the film is really based wholly on the one big stereotype of the title.\n\nOverall a good movie that is original and has a more genuinely fun interplay of characters than you might expect. A fun and somewhat underrated movie.\n\n7/10.",

The suspense and fear is better than Jurassic Park.\n\nReally cool Sci-fi tech featured, really awesome play on someone (Driver) struggling to survive a primitive world while also having highly advanced technology, but still facing challenges Top-notch cinematography, lighting, and CGI makes you feel very immersed into the world and situations\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe plot is extremely basic and predictable. Man faces a few obstacles that he overcomes, most of them the same situation, that&apos;s about it. There&apos;s only two characters basically, and the dialog between them is limited. This works for a bit, but there&apos;s not enough development of the characters, and it&apos;s easy to just not care about what happens to them one way or another.\n\nIt could have been much better if there was more objectives in the plot, more characters or build up, more on what happened before and after the situation on the planet.",

So, I feel qualified to tell you it is safe to see this movie as it is, without worrying about details like gravity. Do not allow unimaginative naysayers to keep you from enjoying this gem. I mean, we all can enjoy vampire and zombie movies, right? Is any movie any better than &quot;Let the Right One In&quot;? I saw this movie last night in Brookline Mass at a Q&amp;A preview, with director, writers, and an actor -- all combined in two lovely people. No one in our sophisticated audience that included a CETI scientist cared enough about the &quot;laws of physics&quot; problems to mention them in the question period. All we cared about were the endearing characters, the music both acoustic and visual, the plot developments, the shocking climaxes, the compelling emotional plausibility. \n\nThe movie is not about anything as terrestrial as gravity. In the world of this movie, something has happened to upset some kind of cosmic symmetry, and the other earth has appeared from a parallel universe. I do wish some character or other had dispelled the physics with &quot;I don&apos;t know why our orbits are not affected&quot;. But, the metaphor works as a way to discuss looking at oneself. It really does not matter. The acting is perfect, the camera-work perfectly beautiful, the plot deeply affecting with wonderful surprises.",

We are presented with some insight into how and why these things haunt Katie in her later life, but it still feels like it&apos;s missing something.

      "reviewBody": "The International (2009)\n\nWe can&apos;t expect every Tom Tykwer film to be as inventive or intense as Run Lola Run or The Princess and the Warrior, and The International feels almost like a breather, an intentional turn at a conventional film. It&apos;s an espionage and high stakes international drama with guns and deceit and a pair of very distinctly good good guys played by Clive Owen (brilliantly) and Naomi Watts (unconvincingly...probably just miscast). And overall it&apos;s completely enjoyable and slick, well paced, and beautifully filmed, of course.\n\nThe plot is one of those sprawling, behind-the-scenes conspiracy, third world, big money scenarios that must have shades of truth, or lots of truth, but gets simplified into a handful of bad guys and a parade of exotic locales (including the inevitable Third World warlord who is an intelligent and willing pawn in the whole game). What I mean is, the plot almost doesn&apos;t matter in the details, though it&apos;s interesting, and makes you think and worry a little about the world we live in. It&apos;s more how the heroes unfold the facts of the plot, against the odds, the clock ticking, that make the movie good. If you liked the Bourne movies (which are as a whole probably faster and more edgy) or Syriana (which is actually kind of similar in feel overall, Clooney substituted for Owen), this will really suit you.\n\nAnd there is a Tykwer twist now and then, a camera with unusual fluidity, or a scene that gets replayed and rethought. Of course, the hugely complicated shootout in the Guggenheim is a masterpiece of excessive and brilliant kinetic filming. For an amazing short video on the building of the sets for this shoot (yes, it wasn&apos;t at the real Gug), go to www.firstshowing.net and type guggenheim tykwer.\n\nIn all? The best of it is worth the worst of it. A tightly made and not overly preposterous dip into a well stocked pond.",

But its also a very, very funny film and most likely my favorite Chris Farley film (Black Sheep coming a close second).\n\n I should point out that i am English so i haven&apos;t seen any Saturday Night Live shows and only know Farley and Spade from their films and Spades stand up comedy. I think that if you want a film to watch that kills an hour and a half and keeps you laughing from start to finish then this is for you.\n\n It does have moments of slushy &quot;i love you&quot; in it but they are very few and far between and the slapstick comedy is well worth the wait. The story line is very basic, Farley must sell his late fathers brake pads to keep his business alive. But its the amount of situations that both Farley and Spade encounter along the way that make the film so funny and watchable.\n\n I can&apos;t say enough about this film to really sell it to anyone but it simply is a very, very funny film and ironicly if it has a message to leave the viewer with its how sad the loss of Farley is and how much great comedy was lost once he died.\n\nWatch this film\n\n Rotten Addict!"

      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t believe it took me so long to finally see this movie and I must admit I had never seen any work by Billy Bob Thornton. Without a doubt, Sling Blade is one of the finest pieces of work ever put on film. Billy Bob&apos;s performance as Karl Childers is absolutely riveting! I found myself completely fascinated by this character. The entire ensemble of characters are superbly cast. The child actor who plays Frank is talented beyond his years. This story unfolds in many layers, with friendship and love woven between bigotry and cruelty. It begins with a somewhat horrible description of the double murder of Karl&apos;s mother and her lover, but yet is tastefully done with words, no cheap views of blood and gore. It shows how the lack of parental love and understanding can form an individual, but also how the human heart can still have the capacity to be open, as in the relationship between Karl and Frank. You&apos;ll feel completely drawn into this little family with its pain and problems.\n\nThis is a masterpiece of superb acting, writing and directing! If you haven&apos;t seen it yet, please don&apos;t deny yourself the opportunity of viewing one of the most amazingly touching movies you will ever see. Even in the company of great performances by Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman, I think Sling Blade leaves Forrest Gump and Rain Man in the dust!",

      "name": "to call it a disappointment might almost be a compliment, but I dare you to see it",
      "reviewBody": "Note: This works MUCH better on a repeat viewing, practically a masterpiece, and one of the perfectly sad comedies ever made... though the last ten minutes is a slog (perhaps intentionally, as it&apos;s near the end of the tunnel... but it&apos;s still unbearable).\n\nOver the course of my teenage years I&apos;ve seen Being John Malkovich through Eternal Sunshine (those two the M-word, masterpieces, with Adaptation and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind near-great, and Human Nature a fun minor work), and he&apos;s always given something to chew on for the brain. He&apos;s an incredible wit, maybe too incredible, like something that could combust with the amount of ideas and ruminations and skill at defining what&apos;s important to us as people and what we want out of art. Synecdoche, New York could be seen as his life-summation of what concerns him as a writer. And to call it art is simple, because it is: it is, alongside the something like Inland Empire, the most challenging work to come out of American cinema. To say that either one is flawed may come as something as a given, but for Kaufman it&apos;s somewhat more troubling.\n\nThis is a big film of ideas, crucial, life-affirming (or life-damning) thoughts about love and death and loss and forgiveness and, essentially, the process of trying to recreate and recreate and recreate this. But at the same time the intellect to engage full-tilt by Kaufman the writer, the director couldn&apos;t engage me as a viewer emotionally - at least at first. This changed on a second viewing - I&apos;m reminded of Woody Allen&apos;s assertion on multiple viewings of 2001 that Kubrick was much ahead of him on what he was doing - but on a first impression I have to wonder, with everything going for Kaufman the satirist, the original, the sad dramatist, what the movie&apos;s audience really is. Like the play that is rehearsed for decades that Cotard never brings to his audience, what can one take away from Synecdoche, New York as far as connecting with the characters, or just Cotard?\n\nMaybe it reveals something about me just talking about this; indeed this is probably the film of the season, if not just the year (Dark Knight fanatics take note), that you will want to talk about after it ends. As far as puzzling works of art go it&apos;s great for a good argument, especially if one is familiar with how Kaufman&apos;s work has been leading up to this point. It&apos;s not exactly that the film is ever so confusing that one will want to walk out - there is a logic, in a sense, to the life imitating art imitating life imitating art etc etc aspect that makes sense. \n\nWhen Kaufman, as director, makes his film this time about as hopeful as Franz Kafka rewatching the Zapruder film on a loop, even the scenes and moments that *do* feel somewhat powerful emotionally (i.e. Hoffman seeing his daughter in a nudie-booth, or the final scene on the bed with Hoffman and Morton old and in bed with the house, once again, on fire) don&apos;t hit their mark - again, at least at first. It&apos;s almost as if seeing the film again it becomes deeper, more resonant; like any work of art at another point in one&apos;s life, it could change, and if one gives it the chance it does. \n\nCertainly the cast makes it worthwhile to watch: Hoffman is what he is, brilliant at transforming physically as age goes by as Caden Cotard, and at delivering subtle moments of humor amid his health-decay; ditto in her own right to Morton, who ranges from bubbly and lustful to anrgy and dejected (Michelle Williams, too, shows this range); even a bit part by Dianne Wiest is appreciated. They all help to give life to what is a big, somber meditation on (quoting Douglas Adams) Life, the Universe, and Everything.\n\nAnd yet, expressing my (initial) disappointment over the length (at 124 minutes it feels twice as long) or the music (did Kaufman order &quot;kill-myself-piano-tunes-you&apos;ll-love off of ebay for this?) or the personal problem of connecting emotionally with some of the characters as they (intentionally) don&apos;t really grow, shouldn&apos;t, I hope, diminish recommending Synecdoche, New York for anyone who wants something to challenge them, provoke thought and discourse, to engage and disrupt brainwave patterns. Perhaps there should be some disappointment; like life, and the art pulled out of it with pliers, it&apos;s not always a pretty sight, especially near the end. But it is a unique journey I was glad to take, and I hope every few years or so to come back to it, and see if it changes me, or if I&apos;ve changed, since seeing it last.",

      "reviewBody": "Days of Thunder&quot; is a classic racing film that has a lot to offer to fans of high-speed action and heartwarming drama. Directed by Tony Scott and starring Tom Cruise, the movie tells the story of Cole Trickle, a talented and ambitious NASCAR driver who dreams of becoming a champion. While the film may not reach the same heights as some of Cruise&apos;s other iconic roles, such as Maverick in &quot;Top Gun,&quot; it&apos;s still a highly entertaining and enjoyable movie.\n\nThe film is full of thrilling and action-packed racing scenes that captures the intensity and danger of NASCAR racing, with high-speed chases, crashes, and pit stops that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The sound design and cinematography are also impressive, with the revving engines, screeching tires, and dynamic camera angles adding to the excitement of the race.\n\nThe visuals are backed up by a great cast, Tom Cruise delivers a charismatic and engaging performance as Cole Trickle, capturing both the character&apos;s cockiness and his determination to win. Robert Duvall is also excellent as Harry Hogge, the grizzled crew chief who takes Trickle under his wing and helps him hone his skills. The chemistry between Cruise and Duvall is a highlight of the film, with their mentor-mentee relationship providing some of the most heartwarming moments.\n\nNicole Kidman as Dr. Claire Lewicki, the neurosurgeon who treats Trickle after a crash, and Michael Rooker as Rowdy Burns, Trickle&apos;s fierce rival on the racetrack. Randy Quaid also delivers a memorable performance as Tim Daland, the owner of Trickle&apos;s racing team.\n\nHowever the film can be somewhat formulaic and predictable. The plot follows a familiar sports movie template, with Trickle overcoming various obstacles and setbacks on his way to the championship. Some viewers may find the plot and character arcs to be somewhat cliched and lacking in originality.\n\nDespite its flaws, &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; is a highly enjoyable and entertaining movie that delivers plenty of thrills and heartwarming moments.\n\nWhile it may not be as iconic as some of Tom Cruise&apos;s other films, it still holds up as a fun and exciting racing movie. Whether you&apos;re a fan of NASCAR or just looking for an adrenaline-fueled action flick, &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; is definitely worth a watch. So grab some popcorn, buckle up, and get ready for a wild ride.",

    "summary": "Reviewers say 'Sisu' is an action-packed, gory film set in 1944 Finland, showcasing a prospector's relentless fight against Nazis for his gold. Praised for its cinematography, special effects, and brutal combat, it blends action, dark humor, and Finnish culture. However, some criticize the protagonist's unrealistic survival feats and lack of character depth. Despite mixed views on narrative and realism, it's generally seen as an entertaining, over-the-top action film.",

Film just went on like a German tank. Better than most recent James Bonds and closer to early Clint Eastwood westerns with silent scenes and unspoken moments. Just brilliant. The guy got beaten really bad but did not give up, even when the death is obvious, your determination &quot;Sisu&quot; will save the day.\n\nNot all movies are for everyone. So it is useless to complain, same as arguing of colors, is red better than green?\n\nTotally worth of watching and the trailer nails it pretty well.

This movie is for adults and kids and also brought me back to high school even though it was only a year ago! The music brings meaning to the story and without it the movie wouldn&apos;t be complete which is why it is called High School Musical! I hope everyone who sees it enjoyed it as much as I did!! If Disney keeps up at this rate all the new actors and actress, singers and everyone will be the new product of them! Look at Hillary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, Raven, and many others! This movie has a few soon to be rising stars in it! Good job Disney!!",

However, more than most movies, this one will probably have polarized views from audiences. If you appreciate films with characters studies, then you should love &quot;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&quot;. If you prefer action or something very much like the typical Hollywood fare, then this film is definitely NOT for you! \n\nThis movie is about a group of elderly Brits were are brought together by a common thread--they have great difficulty affording their twilight years and see an ad for the Marigold Hotel in India. They each realize that retirement or surgery would be MUCH cheaper there so they arrive in a completely foreign land--with traditions, culture and rules which are practically nothing like home. Some adapt very well to their new land, some definitely do not--but it&apos;s all an adventure and voyage of discovery where each learns more about themselves--as does the audience. Sometimes, the results are a bit formulaic and predictable but very often they are not--and that makes the film very likable. I also like that the older folks in the film are NOT the usual &apos;cute&apos; oldsters you see in films--they have sexual urges, difficulties, flaws and hidden longings. Exceptionally well acted and directed and a joy for this reviewer.",

After being on my feet for hours it was good to sit on my arse at twelve on the night and just switch off and enjoy a mindless bit of action. And that&apos;s exactly what &apos;Lockout&apos; offers. If you&apos;ve seen Luc Besson&apos;s Europacorp action flicks you know what to expect. I love all of them and this was no exception. Guy Pearce is the show stealer as Agent Snow, the John McClane of the space age. His wisecracks and mindless violence keep your attention. Maggie Grace is as good as ever as the damsel in distress and the supporting actors do a bang up job as well. Almost stealing the show from Pearce, but not quite, is Joseph Gilgun as the nutty Scot, sure to make you laugh once or twice, even if you&apos;re hating the film. The effects are well done, the action over-the-top and exciting and it&apos;s overall good late night entertainment. As with all these sorts of films, I&apos;m sure critics and serious Sci-fi nuts are going to hate. But as I always say, for people who can switch off and enjoy a bit of brainless fun, this is a must. Let the haters hate and the watchers watch.\n\n***/*****.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie felt like a true follow up to the original for the first 20 or 30 minutes and I was excited to see where it would go, but it pretty quickly fell apart and degenerated into an aimless and unfunny mess as the film went on, starting with the golf course scene with the 3 millennials, all the jokes were awful and the whole sequence was total cringe.\n\nIt&apos;s like they had a vague idea of what to do but then lost the plot (literally) as time went on, only to finally bring it back around again at the very end of the movie. So much of the cameos were painfully unfunny and poorly acted, they should&apos;ve done a lot more takes to make them work better and not feel so amateurish and lazy. I couldn&apos;t understand a damn thing Bad Bunny said. The pacing felt rushed and unnatural like so many modern Hollywood films, they&apos;ve lost that magic touch especially when it comes to comedy films.\n\nSandler&apos;s a great dude in real life and I&apos;ll give it to him that he does justice to all the original cast who passed away at the end, which is exactly what I expected from him. But most of the middle of the movie is terrible and ruins it, the whole &quot;super golfers&quot; plot was cartoonish and mostly unfunny. If the script had got some rewrites for better jokes, plot, pacing, etc. It could&apos;ve been one of the best legacy sequels, but alas we are left with this half baked mess.",

Whether it was the wrinkled uniforms, the painful dialogue, the over-the-top dramatics and exaggerated explosions (hey, it&apos;s Emmerich!)... it was clear the film was not made for people like me who know the details and the characters very well.\n\nThe rating depends greatly on the target audience. It&apos;s clear this film was made for a younger audience, and as such, it does a very good job of conveying the history quite accurately. It&apos;s a lot to take on with a 2:20 movie (complete with a 6-month summary of events leading up to the title battle) and it does a fine job of that.\n\nCorrect history of this great nation tragically just isn&apos;t taught anymore, so I heartily applaud any effort to do so. I just wonder if younger audiences have any desire to learn it. So if I&apos;m rating from that perspective, it jumps up a few points.\n\nI just wish a little more care with the details and script had been taken to leave the older audience satisfied from our knowledge level.",

The Rock, showing a softer side here, is likable and engaging and the film is sure to attract its target audience, but there&apos;s too much formula and too few laughs for it to really set itself apart from the standard genre.

Critics praise its ambitious themes, visual style, and haunting score by Thom Yorke. However, some find it overly long, convoluted, and lacking cohesion. The reimagining of the 1977 original is both celebrated and criticized. Modern dance and political contexts in 1970s Berlin are significant departures from the original.",

I think this is Jim Carrey&apos;s best performance and made me wonder what other surprises he has up his sleeve. The love that blooms in jail between Carrey&apos;s character and Phillip Morris - a sensational performance by Ewan MGregor - is so profoundly vivid that I was taken by their own strangely innocent affair and went with them all the way. I found myself tearing up and rooting by this two winning misfits. I will recommend you to push your own preconceptions out of the window and have a great time at the movies.",

      "reviewBody": "Anyone who has seen the trailer can expect to get exactly what the trailer depicts. A cop loses his beautiful daughter and sets out to solve the murder that others conclude was self explanatory as a shooting in an attempt to get revenge against a cop. Taking things at face value sometimes just don&apos;t cut it.\n\nGibson and Ray Winstone were so perfect for the roles they played. The tension from both kept me clinging to my seat and wiping my brow. Gibson probably had his best role in this movie. I have seen most of his movies starting with Lethal Weapon and I could not see one potential likeness of Martin Riggs in Edge of Darkness, except for the fact he played a cop. As Craven, he was truly believable as a dad on a mission to make things right. Winstone is someone I didn&apos;t recognize even though he has been in a ton of movies. But after this, I will know and respect him for the rest of my life. Trying to understand his role was a treat, but while doing that, I kept my distance for fear he might have caught me trying to get too close. His thick Brit accent and command of those around him was absolutely a great treat.\n\nDanny Huston is someone I came to enjoy since seeing him in 30 Days of Night as the lead Vampire. He did not disappoint but he could have had a meatier role. As far as I am concerned, he has been added to the list of great seasoned actors to look for anytime you expect to see quality acting.\n\nI mean no disrespect to any of the actors. Everyone did a great job, including some of those in smaller, yet relevant roles.\n\nEverything about the movie was believable and memorable. Some of the violence that you will need to endure will catch you off guard. There is no need to brace yourself because you will get caught off guard.\n\nExcellent emotional roller coaster getting an 8 and a great big &quot;welcome back&quot; hug for Mel.",

      "reviewBody": "Simply beautiful really is the only way to describe such a wondrous film, one which warms the heart, nourishes the soul, and brings a tear to the eye. This statement is neither hyperbolic nor exaggerated, one of many reasons I suggest you see this film.\n\nThe film opens in 1909 when Celie (Whoopi Goldberg in her feature film debut) as a young girl, as well as a victim of incest, impregnated by her father. Unattractive and unloved, separated from her beloved sister and children, Celie has no other option than to be wedded to an abusive, impoverished, and philandering husband named Albert (Danny Glover), a man who treats her no better than a slave. However, Celie&apos;s life forever changes when Albert returns home in accompaniment with his mistress Shug (Margaret Avery), a beautiful Blues singer.\n\nIn spite of the seemingly hopeless situation the film&apos;s plot provides Celie with, the Color Purple is not a tale of her despair, but rather her triumph, one which is immensely inspiring. Stellar in every aspect this film is, including Stephen Spielberg&apos;s highly credible direction, the acting, especially of the four most prominent stars: Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey (both quite impressive in their debuts), Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery, the plot, etc. As one of my most revered novels and films, I definitely recommend the Color Purple.\n\n Grade: A+"

A meeting is announced that will address the issues that such an event has raised.  At the meeting, the main speaker takes the floor, stares at his audience for a few long seconds, then shrugs his shoulders and mumbles &quot;S**t happens&quot;.  What?  You ask.  That&apos;s it? &quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;you can&apos;t expect me to provide YOU with the answers.  But I did take some nice photos&quot;.\n\nThat&apos;s &quot;Elephant&quot;.\n\nIt would be hard to tackle such a topic without sinking into &quot;Movie of the Week&quot; territory, so Van Sant avoids this by sitting down and not doing much of anything.  But artfully.\n\nWhy was this film made?  What does it tell us about the events?  That they happened.  What does he tell us about the victims?  Nothing, absolutely nothing.  We follow them around, interminably (I feel I knew the backs of their heads intimately, if nothing else) and it&apos;s a lot like reality tv -- dull: uninvolving, unrevealing and uneventful.  What does it tell us about the perpetrators?  Nothing we don&apos;t already know, haven&apos;t already read. Insights?  None.   It exists in its own universe, blank and unfeeling, a perfect circle, Art for Art&apos;s sake.\n\nAs far as it goes, there are some beautiful touches, here -- the overlapping time frames, the slowing down of the action to signify a small, private, joyful moment -- but Van Sant bottles out on taking them anywhere, afraid as he seems to be of taking a stand, making a statement or engaging, emotionally, in any way with anything here.\n\nAll in all, an Artsy and pointless exercise in navel-gazing, one that masquerades as something much deeper, and hopes its own silence and blankness will be taken for wisdom."

      "reviewBody": "The movie is about codes of conduct, with 2 main codes that are dying out or are dead.\n\nOne is the code of the Mafia the other is the Samurai.\n\nThe basic plot is this. One of the Mafia wiseguys must be killed as he is having an affair with the daughter of the Mafia Don.\n\nThe person they get to do it is an African American who lives by the code of the Samurai and goes by the name of Ghost Dog. To be honest, I have met many Japanafiles so this is not so unbelievable. \n\nBut the code of the Mafia means that if you kill a wiseguy then you must be killed or the Mafia person who hired him must be killed.\n\nJim Jarmusch makes movies where the characters close relations based on only very small things. The Mafia wiseguy saved Ghost Dogs life, so now he must be his retainer. He lives off the land (lives on a roof, steals the cars and equipment he needs to do a job). There is also a friendship between 2 people who don&apos;t speak the same language. It is the connection between people that is so important here. \n\nIf you saw Dead man and like it, then you will love Ghost Dog. It is funny, serious, dark, tragic and beautiful all at the same time. Dead man missed the mark with some similar themes (though the DVD of Dead man has some deleted scenes that would have made the movie much better and reflected better the idea of small connections being strong connections).\n\nI loved this movie, and I don&apos;t expect everyone else to. Art house movies have small audiences for this exact reason. I know a lot of people who avoided this movie because they thought it was cheesy. The answer is, yes it is, and most of the bad reviews reflect this same idea.\n\nAlso I love the sound track, with lots of Phat beats, and uses Hip Hop (African American culture) to reflect Japanese culture."

One day, his pig is stolen, and he sets out on a mission to find her, revealing a hidden past and putting him in touch with his estranged former life in the process.\n\nThis movie is not your typical Hollywood production. Instead, it&apos;s a slow-burning character study that explores themes of loss, grief, and redemption. Nicolas Cage delivers a subdued, nuanced performance, showing a depth and range that remind us of his acting abilities beyond his typically over-the-top roles. He portrays Rob as a man who has suffered a great deal, but who has not lost his humanity, compassion, or love for his pig.\n\nThe cinematography is stunning, capturing the beauty of the Pacific Northwest wilderness, and the soundtrack is haunting and atmospheric, adding to the film&apos;s melancholic and introspective mood. The supporting cast also delivers strong performances, particularly Alex Wolff as Amir, a young and ambitious chef who becomes entangled in Rob&apos;s quest.\n\n&quot;Pig&quot; is a quiet and contemplative film that rewards patient viewers with a moving and profound experience. It&apos;s not a film for everyone, but for those willing to engage with its themes and characters, it&apos;s a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant work of art.",

The stereotypical melodrama never quite appears on the screen fortunately and Ashton Kutcher gets a great come-back scene that hits a new level of mainstream quality for defying the ordinary, boring dramas of previous movies. The cinematography started well but didn&apos;t continue throughout the movie in its raw, daring, naturalistic form.

I was hooked from start to finish.\n\nThe story was surprisingly compelling, without being too complicated or over the top. The focus on the journey of businessman Henk Rogers and the Tetris inventor, Alexey Pajitnov, was just the right balance of drama and fun. And the way they captured the excitement and anticipation of bringing the game to the world was thrilling.\n\nThe acting in this movie was top tier. Taron Egerton delivered an incredible performance as Rogers, and I was impressed by how he brought so much depth to his character. The chemistry between him and the rest of the cast was palpable and made the story even more enjoyable.\n\nBut let&apos;s talk about those plot twists, they were pretty good! I won&apos;t give anything away, but there were a few surprises that kept me on the edge of my seat. And the way they resolved the conflicts was satisfying and left me feeling content.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves video games, underdog stories, or just wants a fun and engaging movie experience. The attention to detail in the pixelated graphics and the captivating story make it worth watching. So, if you&apos;re looking for a movie that will have you feeling all the emotions, go see &quot;Tetris&quot;!",

      "reviewBody": "Almost a ten for me. 53 year old male who prefers romantic comedy to action-adventure. This film had a wit and a appreciate of today&apos;s woman that made the film very slice of life for me. Beautiful scenes, hilarious wit and almost slapstick. This film is not for the prudish but is by no means obscene. Just great adult fare and Meryl Streep can now do anything. This year she has been Julia Child, Mamma Mia and now the Other Woman. I&apos;d want her back too. Bravo, Nancy, Bravo.\n\nI have never enjoyed Alec Baldwin, but he was light and funny in this film and the pairing really worked. Steve Martin&apos;s role was purposely a little flat but he did underplay things well.\n\nJohn Krasinski is a true scene-stealer. Like Streep, with just a knowing glance or a facial expression, he causes laughs and audiences will just enjoy him. \n\nBest romantic comedy since Something&apos;s Gotta Give. Baldwin is no Nicholson, but this was a better script and Streep has no match.",

The end kind of drags on a bit, like they weren&apos;t quite sure how to wrap it up. Ironically reminiscent of most current SNL skits; they just don&apos;t know when to quit. But for Sandler to exercise the restraint he did (as a comedian) was no small feat and I was thoroughly impressed by his skill as a serious actor (I couldn&apos;t believe how effortlessly he seemed to be able to emote with real tears). Good for him! It might be nice to see him try his hand at other serious roles. If you happen to see it on TV, don&apos;t pass it up.",

      "reviewBody": "Elizabeth Parsons has a rich husband and a young son. When she wakes up on their luxury yacht with blood everywhere and her husband nowhere to be found, she is suspected of his murder to get the life insurance. While serving 6 years, she discovers that her husband is very much alive. She learns that she can&apos;t be tried for his murder since she already has been, and begins to plan his death and how to get her husband back.\n\nDespite that fact that the whole film is summed up in the title I decided to watch it anyway. So really there is very little drama for much of the film as we all know what she&apos;s doing and where the film is going. The plot could have been lifted from any number of video thrillers - all it needed was a little nudity and it could have been an erotic thriller for late night TV! As it stood, the bigger budget, higher production values and bigger stars helped the film actually rise a little above the material and seem to be much glossier and impressive than it actually was. The stunts and effects worked well and the direction was of a higher calibre than you&apos;d see on the bottom shelf, but it is still a very ordinary thriller if you strip all the polish away.\n\nThe cast try hard but they have little to work with. An unnecessary role from Tommy Lee Jones helps keep the film&apos;s pace up by turning it into a cat and mouse chase of sorts, but mostly it is pretty dull. Judd is OK in the lead but doesn&apos;t do anything to justify her fee I reckon. Support from Mafia is so lame that it looks like she is almost falling asleep while giving her lines! The film relies on pace and tension which it mostly gets by flipping cars around for little reason and for putting Elizabeth in slightly (!) unlikely situations then getting her out of them. The legal interest in the plot actually falls to pieces when you think about it, but the film is clever enough never to take it&apos;s central idea further than a few lines of dialogue before rendering the argument null and void.\n\nOverall I was struck by just how ordinary and dull the whole film was. If I had seen this film as a low budget video thriller I still wouldn&apos;t have liked it but I may have accepted it for what it is. This film just exposed it&apos;s own weaknesses by virtue of pushing to be a product much grander than it&apos;s plot deserved."

I am a huge fan of the book, and if i had been expecting to see on the screen exactly what is in the book i would have been disappointed. However, the film has earnt the 10 stars respectively and should, in my opinion, receive an Oscar. I can tell already that the actress who plays Kate will go far in the film industry and i feel that Cameron Diaz has done herself proud, discarding her comedy label. Overall, a brilliant film with a strong message.",

      "reviewBody": "Never Been Kissed is not a perfect movie, but I wasn&apos;t expecting that. The story is predictable yet simple and the ending is hokey, but I still liked the film. Why did I? Firstly, Drew Barrymore. There may be people who don&apos;t like her, I do and I have since seeing her in Ever After(and that was a wonderful film). Here she does what she does best, which is cute and funny romance, the result is that we are treated to a fun and captivating performance. Secondly, David Arquette is a lot of fun as Barrymore&apos;s slightly odd older brother, and I also enjoyed Leelee Sobieski&apos;s minor turn here. Michael Vartan is charming in his own way as well. The script does have its humorous moments, the film does have a nice feel-good element to it, the direction is fine and the soundtrack is nice. Overall, an enjoyable movie, not a masterpiece, but just a nice bit of fluff. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

He isn&apos;t always like this, but Morgan Freeman does best in films where he&apos;s the likable hero-cop. He is definitely that in this film although his character, Alex Cross, is a little too sharp for believability. There were just a bit too many &quot;oh, come on&apos;s&quot; said by me watching this as Cross would get computer passwords with no trouble, etc. The odds of that happening are millions-to-one but not in the world of films. There were other examples, too, of him figuring out things that were almost impossible.\n\nFor a tough modern-day crime story this film, for the most part, was pretty low- key with low profanity and not a lot of gore or overdone action. That was surprising considering the sordid subject matter. The tameness in here, and Freeman, make this a notch (albeit a small one) above the average thriller.",

It starts out fast and never lets up. The movie flies by. And it has tons of great new characters.\n\nThis movie is absolutely hilarious. I was literally in tears in some scenes. The minions are at their very best with so many memorable moments. The story is surprisingly unpredictable and keeps you invested. The visuals are stunningly beautiful. I was mesmerized. And the action scenes are pretty epic, the best of the entire series.\n\nI had a blast with this movie.

      "reviewBody": "Season of the Witch is getting ravaged by reviews as I write this. Is it that bad? I don&apos;t think so. Is it fantastic then? Well no. This is one of those sword and sandal fantasy films that tread the middle ground, having an interesting premise set up in a fantasy fellowship quest, only for the execution to be hovering around mediocre standards following a rote formula of introducing the problem, gathering the players, and have them encounter sequence after sequence of battle obstacles on the way to their objective.\n\nNicolas Cage and Ron Perlman play buddies Behman and Felson respectively, knights of the Crusade who make a reputation of being fearsome warriors fighting for a higher cause, only to desert their army and turning their backs from continuing onto Jerusalem after realizing that they are nothing but fighting pawns for the whims of man. Their services get called for by a town inflicted by a plague because of a curse by a girl (Claire Foy) whom they deem a witch, and the agreement forged was for them to escort her to a monastery for a group of monks to decide on the authenticity of the claim, and if so, decide and inflict punishment.\n\nGathering Priest Debelzag (Stephen Campbell Moore), guide Hegamar (Stephen Graham), one of the remaining fighting fit soldiers of the town with Eckhart (Ulrich Thomsen) and a priest in training Kay (Robert Sheehan) whom the party picked up early in their journey, the group has to band together if they are to get to their destination in one piece, with the accused girl being locked up in a cage but always seem to be drawing undue attention to herself, raising questions about her innocence as we get to see her demonstrate abilities and superhuman strength even, while putting on a saccharine sweet face. Now while all these may point to certain plot loopholes and irrational human behaviour, I&apos;m willing to overlook these flaws since they do get addressed in the final reveal, so all&apos;s not totally lost in Bragi F. Schut&apos;s story.\n\nBattle sequence design was a little sleepy, and although the introductory big battle scenes involving soldiers of the Crusade were plentiful, it didn&apos;t go beyond the usual slash-parry- stab-wash-rinse-repeat cycle coupled with cheesy dialogue exchange between Behman and Felson that try to pass off as comedy. There&apos;s an awfully long and painfully executed crossing of a creaky bridge that doesn&apos;t seem to want to end, but otherwise passable CG was employed in an attack of wolves, and the money shot in the final battle where all hell breaks loose in the monastery with grotesque looking winged beasts and the expected big boss to fight in an all out melee done arcade style.\n\nSome will probably find the themes here quite objectionable, especially since it sets its sights squarely on how religion gets manipulated by the few, and made suggestive queries what if the Crusade wasn&apos;t a calling made by god as claimed by the messengers, but of more negative forces since it involves the killing of innocents. What more, this was played out in quite direct fashion when the final act made that cross-reference in point blank fashion. It&apos;s bold in its statement and association, which otherwise the story here lacks any selling points to make an audience sit up and take notice\n\nI&apos;m not sure what Ron Perlman is doing here - the billing on the poster doesn&apos;t seem to give him much respect, preferring to marquee Cage alone instead, so while there are inside nods to Hell and the devil and demons here, I&apos;m hoping that we&apos;ll get to see another installment of Hellboy instead. Under Dominic Sena&apos;s vision, you&apos;d know what to expect when you scan through his resume, being responsible for flicks like Whiteout, Swordfish, and yet another Nicolas Cage starrer in Gone in Sixty Seconds. They&apos;re no more than Guilt Trips with potential not lived up to, so don&apos;t expect a classic or a masterpiece, but at best entertainment that will struggle to satisfy jaded audiences.",

The hand-held camera adds verite but doesn&apos;t jitter so constantly as to stimulate nausea. There are some gorgeous visuals - both spectacular natural shots and also effects shots such as The Wall. And the two unknowns who we accompany on their journey - the gorgeous Whitney Able and the not so gorgeous Scoot McNairy - are both very good.\n\nBut most credit must go to Gareth Edwards, the creative force behind this film.",

(I do think though it improved over time... a little.) \n\nBloodsport was inspiration for a whole generation to start learning martial arts. A Cult movie. I grew up some of my life in Asia and it amuses me to see those buff cliché white men jumping around through colourful, but grubby marketplaces/ back alleys. In fact the whole movie is simple and has even a nice tidy cliché structure: Man starts terribly, improves through tough training and develops into sexy fighting machine. Some people who commented on this movie said he is no Bruce Lee. But that is the beauty of it. He is somebody from a western country trying to measure up and fit into the eastern culture. Good stuff.",

      "reviewBody": "With a new director (Daniel Alfredson) taking charge of the second film in the Scandinavian version Millennium series, The Girl Whi Played with Fire is not at all a disappointment but is less striking and less memorable than the first film, who introduced the characters of the trilogy. The judgment may be more severe than the film really deserves because the it is certainly a well written and well built crime story, with solid characters brought to screen by a team of actors who each makes his job wonderfully, from the leads to the smaller parts. It is probably the surprise effect that is unavoidably gone and maybe also the more standard cinematography that replaces the frozen landscape that dominated The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo. Yes, the Swedish summer can be very pleasant but the winter films better.\n\nThere are more biographical details that we learned about The Girl in the title of the movies, and the action of the film turns around her family and her traumatic childhood we had a glimpse about already. Noomi Rapace is as good as in the first film, but she still keeps enough secrets to have us interested for her fate in the final film of the series. Michael Nyquist&apos;s character is slightly relegated to the role of the classical seeker of truth, but his acting is still so good that I continue to be concerned about Daniel Craig taking over his role in the Hollywood version in-making (although I like the actor and I believe he deserves and can make much better than a Bond).\n\nMaybe the secret of the magnetic force of these films is that faced with the most sordid vice or violence or put under the darkest physical or psychological threats the heroes created by Stieg Larsson remain without doubt human. Too bad that these series un-naturally end in a trilogy. The quality of the dialog and the building of tension, the sophistication of the crime story and the human dimension of the characters ask for more. On the other side, the sonata is one of the most perfect pieces in music and it always is composed of three parts. There may be logic in fate sometimes.",

      "reviewBody": "After the traumatic experience of losing his beloved wife Debra (Angela Bloomfield) in a car accident, the architect Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) acquires the ability of seeing ghosts. He quits his profession; abandons the construction of his dream house to live with Debra and becomes a con man, using the ghosts Cyrus (Chi McBride), Stuart (Jim Fyfe) and The Judge (John Astin) to haunt houses and then charging the dwellers to exorcise their homes.\n\nDr. Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado) visits the reclusive Patricia Ann Bradley (Dee Wallace-Stone), who was a former delinquent and girlfriend of the serial–killer Johnny Bartlett (Jake Busey) that lives with her mother, she notes that Patricia has bruises. Lucy returns home and together with her husband Ray Lynskey (Peter Dobson), they are haunted by a poltergeist. She calls Frank and soon Ray has a heart attack. Lucy meets Frank in a restaurant and he realizes that Soul Collector is marking numbers in the forehead of his victims before killing them. Frank becomes prime suspect of the police due to his knowledge about the murders and he is arrested. Meanwhile the psychotic FBI agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs) comes to the city to investigate the murder cases. When Frank finds that Lucy will be the next victim of the Reaper, he takes the ultimate decision to fight the entity to save her.\n\n&quot;The Frighteners&quot; is a weird, but entertaining and original film by Peter Jackson. The story is too violent for comedy and too silly for horror; therefore the genre is indeed a combination of comedy, romance, horror and fantasy. The special effects are excellent and state-of-art for a 1996 movie. Michael J. Fox shines in the role of the psychic Frank Bannister and Trini Alvarado is perfect in the role of his romantic pair Dr. Lucy Lynskey. All the characters are interesting and peculiar, and the cast has great performances independently of the special effects. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Os Espíritos&quot; (&quot;The Spirits&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "WARNING! DO NOT READ IF YOU DON&apos;T LIKE SPOILERS!!! It amazes me that they can show murder, torture and blood and gore in this movie yet when it comes to nudity, they have to hide it by blurring the images. Even swearing with the F-bomb is omitted out which is stupid. In this movie, murder, torture and even decapitation are somehow more acceptable to televise but no swearing or nudity allowed? The Network censors are nuts! \n\nThis movie is sick and very disturbing! It&apos;s about an international club of sadistic rich people who pay big bucks through a bidding process to murder a man or woman through torture. Victims come from the hostel in Slovakia and their passport images are scanned and sent out to members. Once you enter into a &quot;contract&quot; to do this, you cannot leave until you murder your victim. Each of the members have a dog tattoo that identifies them as part of the club. Expect to see kids have guns pointed to their heads (one is shot in the head), cannibalism, dogs tearing a person to pieces, and a woman having her face shredded up with a saw to name a few. It seems like everyone in this town is bad to the bone.\n\nYou get the sense that once you&apos;re marked as a victim there really is no escape from the factory where they keep the victims. Even if you do, the reach of this group is so wide that they can still get you as you&apos;ll find out with Jay Hernandez&apos;s character. You really need to see the fist movie to understand the second although you can get the gist if you have not. \n\nSadly we see a decent caring person forced into becoming a monster herself first in a bid for survival then for revenge! It seems that in both the first and second movies, the lead characters commit murder without hesitation after being victimized themselves. \n\nThe message is that having enough money can do anything even turn the tables on those that would have you be the victim. I think most of us like to see evil people get their comeuppance so seeing some of them pay for their evil deeds is satisfying but unfortunately not all the people that deserve it do and it thus opens the door for yet another sequel! If you have a sick sense of humor, you will like the ending with the street kids playing soccer with someone&apos;s head! It&apos;s disgusting yet the victim got her comeuppance for being evil so to me it was good!I won&apos;t divulge who it was."

      "reviewBody": "This was a fast-moving Rambo-style action flick (good guys never get hit despite 10,000 rounds of ammunition fired at them) that was very popular. It spawned a very weak sequel, par for the course. Several reviewers here wrote that it is Steven Seagal&apos;s &quot;best movie,&quot; and I wouldn&apos;t argue with that..\n\n&quot;Under Siege&quot; probably was more popular than the normal Segal action flick because of several aspects: 1 - the interesting story featuring the &quot;lowly cook&quot; (as Seagal described himself in this film) beating a bunch of terrorists taking over a U.S. Navy vessel; 2 - the over-the-top villains portrayed by fun-to-watch actors Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey, and 3 - the fabulous looks and body of Erika Eleniak, who pops out of a cake topless in a sight that every guy who saw this film remembers.\n\nJones was just about hitting his acting career peak as he demonstrated the following year with his Oscar-winning performance in &quot;The Fugitive.&quot; Busey was the opposite, nearing the end of his run after a starring role as singer &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; made him famous. \n\nThis film might be Segal&apos;s most successful, or at least in the top three. His star has faded since the new century. Eleniak never made it far past the cake. She played &quot;Elly May&quot; in &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; the following year and nothing but &apos;B&apos; films after that.\n\nThe first part of this movie is far better than the second. It gets out-of-control by the end, as most of these action films do with the violence overdone and with little credibility. But watching the three leads, and ogling Eleniak, always make this film fun to watch for a little while, at least.",

      "reviewBody": "The teenager Zach (Dylan Minnette) moves from New York with his widow mother Gale (Amy Ryan) to Madison, Delaware, where she will be the vice- principal of the local high-school. Zach is bored and upset and while bringing his cardboard boxes with his belongings home, he meets his gorgeous next-door neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush) that welcomes him. But soon her creepy father R.L. Stine (Jack Black) threatens him if he gets close to his daughter again. Zach befriends the clumsy Champ (Ryan Lee) at school and they schedule to go to a party together on Friday. However, Zach meets Hannah again but they are caught by Stine. Zach believes that Stine is an abusive father and he breaks in his house with Champ to seek out Hannah. When Zach opens a book in Stine&apos;s library, he accidentally unleashes a monster from the book. Soon he learns that the weird Stine is a famous writer of horror stories that keeps his imaginary friends that are monsters locked up in each book. But Zach released the evil Slappy that promises to bring havoc to Madison opening all the books on the same time.\n\n&quot;Goosebumps&quot; is a silly film that entertains. The plot has funny moments but Champ is an unbearable character and Ryan Lee does not help with his face. &quot;Aunt&quot; Lorraine is also annoying, but Amy Ryan performs a nice character. The chemistry between Dylan Minnette and the lovely Odeya Rush, who seems to be a sister of Mila Kunis, are worthwhile watching. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Goosebumps: Monstros e Arrepios&quot; (&quot;Goosebumps: Monsters and Chills&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Mediocre following about one army man incarnated by Vin Diesel and with guns, girls, global domination and intense action scenes . It is packed with action sports , thrills and guns that look like willies . Cage once again is recruited by the government on a special mission . While NSA Agent August Gibbons (Samuel L Jackson with a comedy scar) is missing , agent Jane Marke (Toni Collette) forces him to cooperate with the government along with a motley group . Betting Marke can succeed where other conventional agents have failed . Marke sends Cage to investigate and to foil some enemies who plan to plunge the free world into anarchy , as Xander using his natural abilities and a whole lot of position attempts to destroy the Pandora Box . He&apos;s helped by an expert team , an all-new outfit of thrill-seeking cohorts and taking on a dangerous band led Xan (Donnie Yen) . Cage must combat an intelligent organization and a powerful enemy far beyond his possibilities . Kick some ass, get the girl, and try to look dope while you&apos;re doing it. There are no more patriots, just rebels and tyrants. \n\nIt&apos;s a standard actioner with no much sense where there is suspense, thriller, pursuits , action sports , struggles , explosions and minimum characterization. The film is plenty of macho man incarnated by Vin Diesel , a peculiar hero who often has problems with authority and full of tattoos , attitude , noggins cueball as well as muscles and giving an embarrassing acting .The picture contains fights, gun-play ,chases , firepower and frenetic pursuits with leaps as when a water-motorcycle runs afoul . Like James Bond&apos;s old action franchise , it has blow-up and gadgets and one-liners and sex with women who don&apos;t talk but kill . Jaw-dropping action set pieces , where Vin&apos;s head is superimposed in to things that look a bit like sky , water and snow in a series of death-defying stunts . It&apos;s tense and exciting at times , though also a routine unstopped action film , less than memorable . Decent support cast such as Toni Collette , Samuel L. Jackson , Donnie Yen ,Deepika Padukone ,Kris Wu , Tony Jaa , Nina Dobrev, Rory McCann , Al Sapienza , Hermione Corfield , Nigel Bennett and cameo by Ice Cube .\n\n Colorful cinematography by Russell Carpenter and appropriate music adjusted to the action by Brian Tyler .The film is lavishly produced by the great producer of action genre Neal Moritz who has produced Prison break,Torque,Swat,Stealth,Skulls,Fast and furious I,II... The motion picture was regularly directed by D. J. Caruso . Heis a good craftsman whose films often have intense car crashes such as Disturbia (2007), and The Eagle eye (2008) , Taking lives (2004) and this XXX Return of Xander Cage .Rating : Average\n\nThe first entry was XXX (2000) by Rob Cohen with Vin Diesel , Marton Csokas , Asia Argento, Danny Trejo , Samuel L Jackson . Followed by xXx: State of the Union (2005) by Lee Tamahori with Ice Cube as Darius Stone , Willem Defoe , Scott Speedman and Samuel L Jackson . All of them lavishly produced by Neal Moritz .  And announced XXX 4 by Director: D.J. Caruso , Writer: Rich Wilkes , Stars: Vin Diesel, Deepika Padukone, Roy Wang",

      "reviewBody": "It wouldn&apos;t matter what you might show or say - people who have taken a liking to an &apos;artist&apos; or their particular &apos;style&apos; will defend them regardless. So it probably is with Frida Kahlo and Diago Rivera. Every country must have its acclaimed legends good or bad - the USA with Pollock and Warhol, Spain with Picasso and so it goes - it&apos;s the law of economics and superiority, etc...Oh, not to mention art....\n\nThis glossy film version of Kahlo&apos;s life and work sets out to make a hero of her and nothing will stand in its way. In the attempt to do so it pulls out all stops ~ striking visual imagery from Mexican born director of photography Rodrigo Prieto (Water For Elephants &apos;11) ~ marvelous visual effects from Dawson and Schrecker ~ good performances from most of the cast ~ OK (if overly voyeuristic) direction from Julie Taymor ~ evocative music score by Eliot Goldenthal ~ lots of color and angst.\n\nMaybe there wasn&apos;t a great deal to work with in Kahlo&apos;s life, as the movie spends more time indulging in over detailed examinations of her somewhat sordid private life. This may not seem so sordid if you happen to be into numerous extramarital affairs --with either sex that just happens to suit the situation-- According to the screenplay Frida divorced Rivera on grounds of his extramarital affairs - even though she knew of these right from their first meeting and he had told her many times he was incapable of any control over them. Problem was, Frida&apos;s own marital agreement was often broken in the same way but unlike Frida, Rivera (it seems) was not willing to dabble with both sexes. It&apos;s also obvious Frida had been known for her unabashed carnal indulgences as a schoolgirl - let alone an adult - in or out of marriage. \n\nOf course fans will excuse these dalliances on the grounds of her &apos;artistic&apos; temperament and physical sufferings - well, so be it. Many will regard this movie highly (especially the fans) others may feel a little left out. Good looking but maybe not a great deal more..."

Anyone going to a film with jet Li or Jason Statham should know what to expect. Going to a film with the two of them and you know there is going to be blood, violence, killing, action, noise, and an eventual winner. If this is not your cup of tea, go see The Nanny Diaries and leave this to the fan boys.\n\nThis is not their first film together. They both appeared in The One six years ago. This time they are the leads and on opposing sides - Statham an FBI agent and Li a contract killer. The action takes place in the middle of a Yakuza war in San Francisco.\n\nFans of Jet Li will not be disappointed. he still has all the moves even if he is 47; however, he does rely more on swords and guns, and other weapons in this film. Statham is Li&apos;s equal and gives as good as he gets. The story has an interesting twist which i will not give a clue on as it is a major plot point.\n\nInteresting entertainment by girls in cages at the Yakuza club. I thought that went out in the 60s, but it was a nice diversion.\n\nThis film is red meat. It has no pretensions of quality and dialog is minimal, which goes along with the story. If you are a fan, you will be entertained. If you are not, why are you there?",

For me the comedy section was hit and miss and it excelled when it was more serious and the action as a whole was very good. Unfortunately Amber Heard&apos;s character optimised this and her whacky appearance seemed out of sync with the rest of the film and the comedy didn&apos;t particular work and just felt more strange than anything else. Overall though an easy and enjoyable watch.",

Brilliant acting (Greta Gerwig is so into the character of Frances), excellent rhythm due to the fine/so accurate montage and very gentle touch of houmor at the right amount. The black and white gives to the whole movie a tone of shade which gives a nostalgic feeling. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry but above all it will bring you to the position to question your own motivations and choices in life and if fighting for your own goals is enough to finally make ends meet and come to balance with yourself. I really reccomend this movie and i&apos;m happy that i discovered it.",

      "reviewBody": "The Farrelly brothers have had a successful history, but their best work was past them a long time ago. Dumb and Dumber and There&apos;s Something About Mary are among the two funniest comedies of all-time, and put the brothers at the peak of stardom. However, their track record afterwards is a heavily mixed bag; you find your underrated gems (Osmosis Jones, Fever Pitch) and then your disasters (Shallow Hal, Stuck on You). The Heartbreak Kid is their attempt to reach back into grade-A stardom like back in the late 90s. Joining with old friend Ben Stiller, they attempt to successfully recreate an old Neil Simon story about a man who has second thoughts about his marriage during his honeymoon. What we get is a cruel, twisted, vulgar, outrageous, and bittersweet movie that tramples over morality and messes around with the typical romantic comedy formula. Unfortunately though, the cruelty in this movie prevents it from being anywhere near romantic. While the Farrelly brothers crafted their best work since Osmosis Jones, this is still nowhere near as good as their comedies of the previous decade.\n\nHeartbreak Kid is about Eddie (Ben Stiller), a lonely man who meets a woman (Lila, played by Malin Akerman) during a random encounter, and after a few weeks believes that she is the perfect woman for him. However, right after the wedding, another side of his perfect woman is revealed, and is slowly but surely becoming a nightmare come true. Despite their honeymoon being in a beautiful portion of Mexico, the honeymoon is a disaster as Eddie struggles to survive being with his new wife. Worst of all, during the honeymoon he meets another woman, Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), who seems to be absolutely perfect for him. In this cruel script, nobody is the hero, and seemingly everybody is the victim in some way or another. Nobody is safe in the movie; which makes this story perfect for the Farrelly Brothers.\n\nBen Stiller seems to play the same kind of role multiple times, as he has a similar presence to that of his character in There&apos;s Something About Mary and Along Came Polly. The only difference is, he&apos;s a bit more sinister and a much bigger jerk. His new wife is portrayed perfectly by Malin Akerman, who isn&apos;t afraid of embarrassing herself or showing off her body. Their physical humor together creates the biggest laughs in the movie. The most desirable character by far comes from the best performance; Michelle Monaghan of Mission Impossible fame delivers this charming, sweet performance as the adorable and beautiful Miranda. Everyone else did a decent job, with Jerry Stiller in a throwaway role as Eddie&apos;s father and Carlos Mencia (surprisingly funny) as a manager of the hotel in Mexico.\n\nThis movie&apos;s biggest flaw is its obvious attempts to re-create the surprise vulgarity and bittersweet content of There&apos;s Something About Mary. It worked back then, but it has trouble now, simply because the characters are not as likable, and the movie lacks heart. In Dumb and Dumber, you knew that they weren&apos;t meant to get that dream girl, but their persistence and their kindness (hidden underneath their stupidity) allows for the audience to root for them regardless. In There&apos;s Something About Mary, the main character goes to great lengths to find Mary and attempt to be with her; it became a raunchy and bizarre hero&apos;s journey. In this movie, the main character selfishly marries, and tramples over other people (emotionally mind you) in order to find his actual soulmate; making him not a necessarily likable character.\n\nIn spite of the lack of heart, you will find the laughs, no denying that. The new wife from hell routine was spoiled far too much in the previews, yet was still enjoyable. Unfortunately, once again, misdirection keeps Heartbreak Kid from being funnier than it could have been. After a while, Lila practically disappears from the movie, focusing more on Eddie&apos;s budding romance with Miranda. The movie mellows down once Lila is out of the way, and then we see a train wreck waiting to happen for about half an hour. If you are a fan of There&apos;s Something About Mary, there will be plenty to laugh about, but none of the content is rich or deep; most of the funniest scenes happens to be gross-out and shock humor. One unique thing in Heartbreak Kid is pretty crappy special effects, which makes it worse for this kind of movie because these kinds of movies do not use much special effects, if any at all. Soundtrack also isn&apos;t as catchy or as fun as other Farrelly Brothers movies, especially Dumb and Dumber.\n\nBottom Line: Heartbreak Kid is funny, but its not an instant classic, nor is it a type of movie to take a date to. While it is not as painfully disastrous as Good Luck Chuck, it still pales in comparison to recent adult comedies and early Farrelly efforts. Ben Stiller still provides the laughs through his physical humor and his ability to perfectly portray a man mentally breaking down. However, this movie has major morality issues and then really slows down once the romance builds up, yet we aren&apos;t rooting for anybody because everyone is guilty of lying, deceiving, and worse (except for one character). The directors are somewhat on the right track back to their glory days, but still have a longs way to go. They also really need to grow up and try to fray away from the gross humor, something that Mike Myers suffers from. Looking for laughs? Look no further. Looking for an amazing film? Keep looking.",

      "reviewBody": "Big, dumb, loud, and fun. Four words that could aptly summarise the appeal of this blockbuster movie which proved a hit with audiences back in &apos;92 and spawned three inferior sequels. UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is probably Van Damme&apos;s most successful mainstream movie to date and his pairing with Lundgren as the enemy is a good one; Lundgren&apos;s height alone gives him the imposing edge over the smaller, tougher Van Damme and their final one-on-one battle is one to remember. Packed with lots of hard-edged violence and some unwanted comic relief from a highly annoying female support (Ally Walker), UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is a movie that gets better as it goes along.\n\nAt first, the sheer woodenness of Van Damme and Lundgren is inexcusable. I know that they&apos;re supposed to be playing emotionless dead robots, but even after they first rebel they seem wooden and unable to even say their lines convincingly. Thankfully this wears off as time goes on and the pair settle down into their roles. In fact Lundgren goes a 360-degree turnaround at the end and actually becomes quite good as the psychotic soldier who believes that he&apos;s surrounded by the enemy. Van Damme? Well, here he plays a more sympathetic character than usual which will no doubt endear him to female fans, while still providing the high-kicking action that the fans expect. Ally Walker is terrible, though, as the intensely annoying female lead, and although it&apos;s good to see Ed O&apos;Ross make an appearance as a colonel, he&apos;s underused and killed off quickly.\n\nThe flimsy plot strings together a scene of big-budget action sequences (no surprise, as most of Roland Emmerich&apos;s films are thus styled, e.g. INDEPENDENCE DAY) which are pretty impressive. From the opening hostage stakeout at the Hoover Dam to the shoot-up at a motel, to the climatic truck chase and the final battle with Van Damme and Lundgren, things just keep getting better and better. The high body count sees lots of people getting shot or killed in nasty ways, and of course there&apos;s the usual quota of bullet-shedding and big explosions.\n\nLundgren&apos;s method of death at the end of the movie (like you couldn&apos;t guess) is highly graphic and unexpected. The loud score is sufficiently adrenaline-pumping to work and the film tries so hard to please that the feeling rubs off on the audience. Although it may be dumb entertainment, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER &quot;delivers the groceries&quot; so to speak and is quite watchable in a forgettable way, in that it passes the time and engages the attention but doesn&apos;t leave much impact afterwards. It may be a popcorn movie but it&apos;s undoubtedly a well-made one.",

      "reviewBody": "Toorop is a &quot;bad-ass&quot; who does things in line with his chosen lifestyle. When he is &quot;approached&quot; by the shadowy but powerful Gorsky to transport a girl from his home in Russia across into New York (where he is wanted on charges) he accepts the job. He collects the angelic Aurora from an ancient monastery along with her guardian, Sister Rebeka and the journey begins. Many are the dangers ahead but soon Toorop realises that the greatest danger may be Aurora herself.\n\nThis film got roundly bad reviews and, if you manage to make it through 90 minutes then you will find out for yourself why that was the case  it is not something that the film hides from view. With any sort of &quot;full world&quot; sci-fi, the risk is always that your design of that world will make it look ridiculous and also lack any sort of logic as to why things would be that way. There is an element of that here but the bigger problem is much tighter to the core of the film  the story itself. The vast majority of the film is a journey where the dangers and the stakes are increasing at each step. We don&apos;t learn a lot as we go but for me there was enough to keep me going because I wanted to see where it was going. However as it reaches a point where things should start coming together and the &quot;bigger picture&quot; take over the narrative flow from all the running and shouting that it has been for the majority, well, well then it just falls apart.\n\nExcept &quot;fall apart&quot; is not the best description for it because really what happens is that it becomes incredibly tangled. Last week I had the pleasure of using two sets of tweezers and a very bright light to untangle a tiny silver necklace belonging to my partner  no part of it stood out as different, it took a lot of work to make sense of the different parts of this massive knotted ball of a chain and it took me ages to translate that knot into a chain again. I mention this because in a way this film is the same by the end because just where you want it to be coming together in a big way, all that happens is it becomes more knotted and more nonsensical. Sadly there is nobody working to make it anything other than this and the closest thing to a &quot;chain&quot; that we end up with is a horrible ending that feels like the makers holding their hands up and saying &quot;Look, I think we all agree that we should probably just bring this whole thing to a close without any fuss and all go our separate ways. Sorry&quot;. Some who love this film (and there are some  there are always some) will explain it to you and help you see what you missed; this is never an easy conversation because even those defending the film have to work with their tweezers and such to pull sense out of it. And once they do  once you and I understand the plot and more or less what was going on, we will still be left with one undeniable fact  we still don&apos;t care.\n\nCaring is the problem that occurs due to the terrible narrative. At the start I was interested as I was just starting out but, the more it went on, the less I cared. It didn&apos;t engage me or give me reasons to keep being interested and by the time the awful ending came round I simply didn&apos;t care enough to be angry by how little closure it gives the story. I&apos;m not sure where the fault lies but I suspect it should be evenly spread. The script is poor and the delivery of that script is poor. The cast must have seen something better than I did because there are some solid names in here  certainly it wasn&apos;t a matter of &quot;oh, Vin is on board? Sign me up then&quot; because that ship has sailed. Diesel himself is his usual solid screen presence. I&apos;m still not a fan but he can hold the attention and is physically imposing. I won&apos;t waste your time considering his performance outside of that but suffice to say that with the material as poor as it is, he had little chance anyway. Yeoh deserves better while Thierry seemingly has no idea what her character is, so she settles for just being irritating for most of the time. Rampling, Depardieu, Strong, Wilson and others all show their faces but nobody knows what they are doing and it all feels like everyone was hoping that the action and sci-fi spectacle would cover this.\n\nVisually I did quite like the film even if some of the scenes are unconvincing &quot;near-future&quot; clichés such as the club which is all scaffolding and violence (but yet rammed) or massive explosions for no real reason. Overall though Babylon A.D. is a mess. It has your bangs and your tough swaggering but it is not big or fun enough to just get by on that. Indeed by its own hand it puts a lot of pressure on the plot to drive the film and then delivery at the end  neither of which it does. It starts simple and gets more and more tangled and then, as a final scene, you are presented this knotted mess and expected to say &quot;thanks&quot;. The only saving grace is, by the time that happens, you will probably care so little about the film that it won&apos;t matter."

      "reviewBody": "In 1932, a group of socialites, landowners, Americans and their servants arrive at a country house for a shooting party over the weekend. As the relationships and tensions twist and weave upstairs, so too do the dynamics and relationships between the various house staff and valets below the stairs. Stories and characters play out but whenever a murder takes place, the police move in and everyone is a suspect.\n\nMy plot summary suggests that this is a sort of murder mystery and that this will act as the driving force behind the narrative, however this is not the case and in reality the film is much more about the characters and relationships than it is about the murder. To this end the film will annoy some people who are perhaps not used to the sort of film that Altman produces and will be looking for the mystery aspect to be the all. However, I found the rather free-wheeling ensemble approach to be very enjoyable and the first hour moved quickly by thanks to the natural interactions and relationships and it was actually the mystery aspect that didn&apos;t work as well because it required too sudden a change in pace  a change that the material seemed to resist and hamper. Despite this it does still work mainly because the Oscar winning writing brings out such convincing relationships and social politics, making it enjoyable and interesting throughout. The direction is great; the use of two cameras in group scenes means that the actors seem to flow around as naturally as their dialogue would suggest  few seem forced to act to a fixed point and seem more realistic.\n\nConsidering the talent on board, it is not surprising that nobody really upstages anyone in particular and the ensemble feel is strong. Smith, Gambon, Thomas, Dance, Northam, Balaban and others make the upstairs fizzle with snobbery and unspoken resentments. Meanwhile the downstairs staff are just as well drawn and delivered by Mirren, Owen, Jacobi, Watson, Bates, Grant, Atkins and others. Stephen Fry is fairly minor within the plot but he is delightfully comic, even if he doesn&apos;t quite fit into the film that well.\n\nOverall this is a classy film very much in the Altman style  an ensemble piece of characters and relationships that we are left to drift within. Some viewers will find it frustrating that it takes so long to get to the point where the mystery kicks in but I actually found this to be the weaker aspect of the film and the most enjoyable parts were the well written characters and dialogue, which deservedly won Fellowes his Oscar."

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie in Galway at the film Fleadh. Dit it entertain me? Absolutely. Would I buy it on DVD / Blu Ray ? Another yes. Funnier than The Hangover [1st film] In my opinion yes. However just like that film you have to decide very early on to suspend your disbelief and just go along for the ride. \n\nI feel a little for John Michael McDonagh as he will no doubt always walk in the shadow of his brother. Which is a burden most writer / directors do not have to deal with. Already an early reviewer has compared it to In Bruges. I think I gave In Bruges a ten star rating. This has an eight. In Bruges - as extraordinary as it was - had a whiff of truth about it and the danger in the movie was real. Here the action is so cartoon that it generates no tension at all, and you never really fear for the characters. Of course Gleeson is in both movies and in my opinion give a much better performance in In Bruges. . Here he is just having fun. Who can blame him... The characters in The Guard are drawn with very broad brush strokes, and lack any kind of subtlety. The sub-plot involving Fionnula Flanagan feels bolted on and slows the movie down. It&apos;s intended to show the main character has a softer side, but you can get that through the thrust of the main story, and the elements are there to take advantage of this. Simple things that could have been done to add a little more realism and heart to the movie that would have generated greater emotion, depth of feeling, tension, jeopardy and ultimately bigger laughs.\n\nAt the Q &amp; A afterward it was suggested the script was written in 13 days. Clearly that was just a first draft - but I do think subsequent drafts were not worked hard enough. As sometimes there isn&apos;t enough breathing space between the jokes... so the bigger gags / situations don&apos;t build in the way they should. Or a moment of compassion is lost because a laugh comes rolling on top of it due to a cheap gag.In that respect it feels to me as if the writer / director is still learning pace and rhythm. It&apos;s very common in comedy where a writer doesn&apos;t want to lose what he feels is a good gag - but sometimes you have to cut gag A in order to get a bigger laugh on gag B. A stronger script editor on the film could have made all the difference.\n\nSo all in all it is a bravo. I very much enjoyed the movie. I do expect John Michael McDonagh to go on to bigger and better things and I wish the movie great success. After all 8/10 is a great score.",

Don&apos;t get me wrong, I enjoy those kind of films as well, but sometimes I just want to sit back and enjoy a movie for it&apos;s entertainment value instead of doing in-depth analysis.\n\n&apos;Plane&apos; has a simple premise (just as the title indicates, I suppose). It is a disaster story, and a film about survival. Gerard Butler stars as Captain Brodie Torrance who flies from Singapore to Tokyo. There are only 14 passengers on board, including fugitive Louis Gaspare (Mike Colter), and 3 cabin crew. Not knowing what to expect from Gaspare, this character allowed for some tension from the beginning.\n\nBrodie is forced to make an emergency landing during a fierce storm. They soon discover they landed on an island run by criminals, and there is no law and order. They have no radio, and no working phones, and they desperately need to find help. So Brodie and Gaspare brave the forest to find help.\n\n&apos;Plane&apos; is fast-paced and became more and more intense by the minute. There&apos;s loads of action, gunfire, and suspense, and very good character development. This is also a very physical role for Gerard Butler, and I thought he did it wonderfully. Mike Colter also makes a credible hero.\n\nFair enough, the film probably won&apos;t be winning any awards, but this is an entertaining movie well worth seeing.",

He looks too skinny to be an engineered human being, bred for one purpose, to be a killing machine (just shaving some actors head doesn&apos;t make him an Agent 47). Wouldn&apos;t all those years of physical training be visible on his physique? Maybe I&apos;m wrong, and he was bred for stamina rather than strength. The action scenes are very well done with some genuine WOW moments, but the story feels too generic, and plagued with the same problems like the first attempt on turning this video game into a movie (they just had to have a woman as his sidekick again!!!). If you expect a good action flick, you will be satisfied, but if you are a video game fan, this just won&apos;t do it for you, as it didn&apos;t do it for me.",

She&apos;s beautiful, she plays rightly, she&apos;s wonderful .\n\nHowewer , the other main character Ethan Hawke is regularly played , his performance is overdone and warped.\n\nThe support cast is featured by French actors : Oliver Martinez who&apos;s doing a American curriculum . Furthermore, Tcheky Karyo also has a broad career American ,generally in secondary roles.\n\nHere is also Jean Hughes Anglade who only has French films , but giving a short acting , where he misinterprets a minor role.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, as always, plays a nasty ,wicked,and evil person. Will he be the killer? .\n\nThe picture is professionally directed by D.J. Caruso . He is a good craftsman whose films often have intense car crashes such as Disturbia (2007), and The Eagle eye (2008) and this Taking lives (2004) .\n\nRating : Acceptable, only for Jolie&apos;s fans.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Nacho Libre&quot; contains much of the same dry, deadpan humor that made &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; so much fun to watch. I&apos;m sure Jared Hess&apos;s brand of humor is not for everybody. We&apos;re living in an era where Dane Cook is our top comedian. So if you&apos;re expecting the same loud, obnoxious gags you see in most comedies nowadays, you&apos;ll probably be disappointed. I, on the other hand, love this type of humor. Just like in &quot;ND,&quot; the actors don&apos;t try hard to be funny. Jack Black is not very convincing as a Mexican. With his skin so white, he sticks out like a sore thumb amongst the rest of the cast. But that&apos;s no big criticism. This is a comedy farce, and if his accent didn&apos;t sound so phony, I doubt his character would be nearly as funny. As an extra treat for all the &quot;ND&quot; fans out there, his character is paired off with a soft-spoken Mexican buddy. They make a good comic team, with Jack being so short and fat, and his buddy being so tall and thin. I tend to just roll my eyes at many of the crude gags I see in movies nowadays, but I even enjoyed the bathroom humor in this movie. I found myself laughing most of the way through, and this is one of the rare cases where I felt that the film lived up to its trailer. Some of the funniest gags were given away in the trailer, but there are many other funny gags that weren&apos;t. If I have any complaints, the movie does sort of drag in the third act. But all in all, &quot;Nacho Libre&quot; is good fun for the entire family. I can&apos;t wait to see Jared Hess&apos;s next project.",

      "reviewBody": "Ah, do I remember the day that I saw Christine, which is disturbing since I was only 6 years old, but my sister said &quot;Do you wanna watch Christine?&quot; and I was confused, my name is Kristine, but she told me about this little horror movie and thanks to her I couldn&apos;t go near our family car for a few months. This is a movie that has always stayed with me and still scares the heck out of me when I watch it in the dark. Who knew that even before taking a driver&apos;s ed class that cars could scare me? But this isn&apos;t just any ordinary car, this is a killer car! This is a car with ghosts in it and you wouldn&apos;t like them if you make them angry or try to take their owner away. Christine is the car that you definitely don&apos;t wanna mess with, otherwise you may have to face those bright lights and loud rock and roll music, what happens next, you may not wanna know.\n\nArnie Cunningham, a typical high school nerd with only one friend, a childhood companion named Dennis Guilder, a popular jock. Arnie&apos;s life begins to change when he discovers Christine, a red 1958 Plymouth Fury in serious need of repair. Arnie begins to restore Christine to her original beauty, but as he spends more and more of his time repairing her, those in his life notice that he is changing as well. Formerly shy, Arnie develops a cocky arrogance. Dennis, as well as Arnie&apos;s new girlfriend Leigh, discover that the car has a deadly past. The previous owner, Roland LeBay, became consumed with Christine and he paid for it with his life. Leigh and Dennis try to save Arnie from a similar fate. They realize that the only way to save Arnie is by destroying Christine. Christine, however, isn&apos;t ready to give up Arnie without a fight.\n\nChristine is a classic horror movie that for me will always deliver on the good scares. I still have a hard time watching it. I think the scariest scene for me will always be the last scene where Leigh and Dennis face off with Christine and you see that Arnie just completely gone. I&apos;m honestly shocked that Keith Gordon didn&apos;t continue on with his acting career, he just blew me away as Arnie, reading the book I couldn&apos;t picture anybody else. He&apos;s absolutely incredible. John Stockwell also pulls in a good solid performance as well. This is one of the rare horror movies that is over all very enjoyable and if it doesn&apos;t scare you, I still think you will like it, it has a great story and a very good cast and crew. I highly recommend that you see this movie if you get the chance, it&apos;s a classic.\n\n8/10",

And if you like zombie movies with comedy elements your expectations hit the Milky Way. Sadly, The Dead Don&apos;t Die just don&apos;t delivers. Compared with other zombie comedies of high rank, most of the comical or fun moments of The Dead Don&apos;t Die just don&apos;t work too good. The horror elements are also just rather mediocre and just feel like necessary additions because of the genre. So what&apos;s left!? Some reviewers say that there is some references to other movies or the movie business to detect, and/or there is some commentaries on our today&apos;s society. That all may be right, but mostly the movie is just very slow and won&apos;t satisfy neither the horror nor the comedy audience. On top, even as an arthouse or artsy whatever movie The Dead Don&apos;t Dies is rather a weak endeavor. Of course, the actors are not bad and still there is here and there a little shiny moment. My rate is 5 but that&apos;s already the highest rate that I can give - and in my view this movie is a great missed opportunity to make something great, especially for the genre.",

A laugh out loud road movie that circles the underbelly of American society with its tongue and leaves you with a sweet lingering taste of other America on your palate. There is an insight in this comedy and this is that every American appears to be hanging around waiting to be in a movie. All the world is a stage but the USA appears to be a rolling film lot, waiting for the next crew to hit town with all the residents switching to bit part mode at any perceived opportunity. They may not be the brightest stars in this film but the ordinary people do shine and without them the other stars would not seem so bright. Yes its laugh out loud slapstick but the humanity and kindness of the real people give soul to a film that badly handled could have been exploitative and cruel.

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Footloose&apos;, despite being an enormous hit back in the 80s, seems to be a very divisive love it/hate it film critically now.\n\nThis reviewer neither loves or hates &apos;Footloose&apos;, from personal opinion it falls short of being great but the immense appeal is definitely understandable.\n\nIts biggest weak point is the story. Conceptually it&apos;s daft, and further hampered by laying it on too thick with the ridiculousness (the drug scene and the basic concept) and over-sentimentality (the Reverend&apos;s somewhat tacky reform that didn&apos;t really ring true compared to how his character was written in general). Ren&apos;s dance routine in the abandoned warehouse was far too randomly placed, coming at an unrealistically weird point in the film.\n\nLori Singer being too old didn&apos;t bother me as much as it did other reviewers, but the overacting, constantly looking as if she was trying too hard, was less forgivable. The script is uneven, sometimes it&apos;s humorously light-hearted and feel good and there is a laudable attempt at providing depth with some more mature themes but too much of it is also cheesy and flimsy.\n\nHowever, the songs are toe-tappingly great, especially the title song &quot;Footloose&quot; and &quot;Let&apos;s Hear it for the Boy&quot;. The dancing is spirited, and apart from that one scene with Ren the choreography and dance numbers are finger-snappingly infectious. &apos;Footloose&apos; is a good-looking film too, beautifully shot and smartly photographed with some inventive visuals in the title song, while the direction is solid enough and the pacing sharp and energetic constantly.\n\nSinger aside, the cast are simply terrific, with Kevin Bacon in the role that made him a star making for a good free-spirited lead and the sadly late Chris Penn proving that he had the talent to make it bigger than he did. Dianne Wiest doesn&apos;t seem capable of giving a bad performance, while John Lithgow is effectively subtle and wisely reigns in in a role that could easily have been the opposite.\n\nOverall, falls short of being a great film but the appeal is definitely understandable, because there are a lot of good elements that outweigh the still quite big flaws. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Even in the midst of a pandemic, December is Oscar-qualifying time. And that means we get Tom Hanks&apos; latest movie. This time out, the two-time Oscar winner reunites with his CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013) director Paul Greengrass (three &quot;Bourne&quot; movies, and Oscar nominated for UNITED 93, 2006) for Hanks&apos; first ride into the western genre. Luke Davies (Oscar nominated for LION, 2016) adapted the screenplay from Paulette Jiles&apos; 2016 novel.\n\nThe beloved Mr. Hanks stars as Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd. We know his full name because he proudly announces it at each stop of his news-reading route. That&apos;s right, even in 1870, which is before television and radio and internet, a person could earn a living reading the news. OK, so it wasn&apos;t the millions that national anchors make these days, as he was dependent on the audience dropping a coin or two in the tin cup. For this they were treated to Captain Kidd&apos;s robust presentation of news and events (and some gossip) from around the nation ... straight from the news clippings he collected during his travels.\n\nOn the trail one day, Captain Kidd comes across a horrific scene of violence, and a 10 year old girl with a shock of blonde hair. She only speaks Kiowa, but the found paperwork lists her name as Johanna (the first American film for Helena Zengel). It turns out, tragic events in her family&apos;s home many years earlier left Johanna being raised by the Kiowa Indians. Captain Kidd is now on a mission to return her to her surviving relatives (an aunt and uncle), but there are at least three obstacles to his plan: it&apos;s a rigorous trip of about 400 miles, the girl doesn&apos;t want to go, and there remains much tension in the split among the post-war citizenry. So what we have here is a western road trip (trail ride) that&apos;s a blend of TRUE GRIT (minus the witty banter) and THE SEARCHERS.\n\nIt should be noted that Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd has served in three wars, including the recently concluded Civil War. He may make his living wearing bifocals and reading newspapers, but Kidd is no nerd. He handles pressure quite naturally, as we witness in chase scene up a rocky hill. The resulting shootout not only creates the first bond between Kidd and Johanna, but also flashes the Captain&apos;s calming influence. This is a soulful and principled Tom Hanks (as usual), but this time he&apos;s riding a horse and his furrowed brow is working overtime.\n\nThe trip to Johanna&apos;s home coincidentally takes Kidd very close to where he once lived - a place that holds his best and worst memories. As viewers we see what Captain Kidd and Johanna don&apos;t. They are both headed back to a past they no longer belong to. Along the way, the two travelers cross paths with characters played by Elizabeth Marvel, Ray McKinnon, Mare Winningham, and the always great Bill Camp. There is nothing rushed about the story or these people. Fans of director Greengrass will be surprised to find an absence of his trademark rapid-cut action sequences, but he has delivered a sweeping epic with superb cinematography (Dariusz Wolski, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; franchise), expert editing (Oscar winner William Goldenberg, ARGO), and a terrific score (8-time Oscar nominee James Newton Howard). Mr. Hanks delivers yet another stellar performance (of course), and young Ms. Zengel&apos;s assured performance likely means we will be treated to her work for years to come. It&apos;s a quasi-western period piece that is plenty interesting to watch, yet lacks the memorable moments to justify multiple watches or a place among the genre&apos;s best.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Submarine&quot; is Welsh. It opens, at least in North America it does, with a letter from its protagonist (Oliver) to Americans; educating us that Wales is a country located next to England. Although thankful that America has not yet invaded his country, Oliver informs us that this is an important film which we should treat with the utmost respect.\n\nDon&apos;t worry, it&apos;s okay to laugh; you&apos;re supposed to. This is a teen coming-of-age comedy. Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts) is like a young, Welsh hero of a Wes Anderson film. Gangly and awkward he struggles with popularity in school, but when he imagines his own funeral, the entire country mourns. He bullies one girl to try and impress another but then writes a long letter not so much repenting his guilt but teaching her how to be cool. The dialogue, like Oliver, is precocious but hilarious with a surprisingly fresh feel considering how tired the genre has become.\n\nOliver tries to win the girl and become the best boyfriend in the world, and he also has to be the best son in the world to save his parents&apos; marriage. In both adventures, he uses psychology books (usually found in routine searches of his parents&apos; bedroom) to ensure his actions accurately reflect his intentions. If you can guess how his plans may go awry, then you are the right audience for this very funny film.\n\nHis father, Lloyd (Noah Taylor) is a depressed marine biologist, while his mother Jill (Sally Hawkins) is inappropriately attracted to their neighbour, an old boyfriend of hers. He&apos;s a mystic, theatrical performer, and Oliver and Lloyd are the only ones that see it for the nonsense that it is. Lloyd is like a grown-up, Welsh hero of a Wes Anderson film and I loved how they included the father of the protagonist as a main character and showed that although he was more mature, still not any more in tune with the ways of the world around him.\n\nIt has some slightly dark twists, but &quot;Submarine&quot; succeeds because it never lets up the humour or the quirky tone. Funny? Yes. Important? No, but I certainly get the joke.",

      "reviewBody": "There are very few of us twenty-somethings who grew up without the Muppets. Between Sesame Street, Muppet Show reruns, and videocassettes of the various Muppet movies, we saw these guys all the time. We even had one or two theatrical releases of our own during the &apos;90s. (My personal favorite of those is The Muppet Christmas Carol, which is still annual holiday viewing.) In recent years, since the very underwhelming Muppets from Space, we&apos;ve seen them pop up now and again, mostly in similarly underwhelming TV projects and in short (yet hilarious!) YouTube videos. I am quite happy to say that, in this newest movie, the Muppets are back in a big way! \n\nThe movie starts by introducing us to a new Muppet, Walter, and his strangely human brother Gary. Gary has planned a trip with his girlfriend, Mary, to Los Angeles, and he is taking Walter along to visit the home of his heroes, Muppet Studios. They find the studio to be in disrepair, and hear of an evil plot to destroy it. Can the Muppets, and everything we hold dear about them, be saved? To get my one complaint out of the way, I do feel that this movie was a bit rushed in places. I wanted more time with these awesome characters, and it did feel as if they were trying to get from one place to the next a bit too quickly.\n\nThat said, I spent nearly the entire movie with a smile on my face. These are the Muppets that I grew up with, doing what they are best at doing, with that gently edgy humor at which they have always excelled. While there are some moments that are very touching, it is mostly very funny, with lots of nods to The Muppet Show and The Muppet Movie. While new little Muppet fans should enjoy this, it will be much more meaningful to those who have a history with Kermit and Co.\n\nClearly made with love for Jim Henson and his creations of fur and felt, The Muppets is the most delightful movie I&apos;ve seen in theaters this year."

      "reviewBody": "Isn&apos;t it extraordinary how our opinions can change over time ,well mine anyway. After so many positive comments by people who list this film as one of their all time favourites I thought I should watch The Piano written and directed by New Zealander Jane Campion. It must be over 30 years ago that I first saw The Piano and It was like seeing it for the first time today .I don&apos;t know why I disliked it back then ,there were a lot of changes going on in my life but today I can only praise this film and I&apos;m so glad I was curious enough to revisit it. There has been so much critical praise heaped on &quot;The Piano &quot;I won&apos;t add much except to praise the genius of Jane Campion ,the entire cast and technical personnel ,especially the camera people and film editors not only is it the greatest film to be produced in New Zealand but it holds its own with any film anywhere on earth. The year it was made 1994 The Piano was up against very stiff Hollywood competition with Stephen Spielberg &apos;S brilliant film &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot; if not for that I suspect I&apos;m not the only one to think &quot;The Piano &quot; also would have one Best Picture and Best Director it thoroughly deserved it&apos;s 7 nominations and 3 wins.\n\nIt&apos;s a beautiful film to watch of course the breathtakingly beautiful misty forests and sea scapes of New Zealand . The emotional impact of Holly Hunter&apos;s Academy Award winning performance as Ada ( who doesn&apos;t have a line of dialogue except subconscious narrative ) and of course Anna Paquin as her precocious adult child daughter Flora are superb . Anna was only one year older than Tatum O&apos;Neil the youngest Oscar winner and has had a much more impressive film career than Tatum since her win. The actors Sam Neil as Alisdair ,Ada&apos;s patient but ineffectual husband and Harvey Keitel as George Barnes the lonely overseer with a vivid fantasy emotional life are also very impressive in these roles . I did wonder if the few sexual scenes could be filmed as convincingly in today&apos;s ME Too World ? the actors would have to follow much stricter guidelines I suspect.\n\nFinally I guess I&apos;m writing this to encourage anyone who feels very strongly about or dislike a much praised movie to keep an open mind and give it another chance as I did the reward was worth it. Ps the music of course by Michael Nyman adds to the enjoyment but it&apos;s Director and writer Jane Campion who has produced a film where even the title &quot;The Piano.&quot; An inanimate object becomes almost a living character that determines all the main characters fate and destiny.",

So when I bought this movie, I was expecting a light and fluffy movie.\n\nThe movie was light and fluffy, but it was also endearing as well. Duff shined in this role; definitely her best one yet. She played Cinderella (aka Sam) perfectly and with such innocence and poise. Chad Michael Murray was the surprise of the movie, however, playing Prince Charming (aka Austin) with all the charm and charisma you&apos;d expect from one.\n\nThe music was an added touch to this cutesy film, every scene memorable in it&apos;s own way (particularily at the end during the football game).\n\nJennifer Coolidge&apos;s character was the only disappointment in the movie. Fiona could have had so much more depth to her character in this film and the way she was portrayed clashed with the overall feeling of the movie.\n\nWho knew that if you substituted a glass slipper with a cell phone you&apos;d get such a wonderfully sweet re-make? Definitely recommended to those that can watch a movie with girl-y fluff."

Kurt Russell steals the show as an over-the-top super hero, who wants nothing more than for his son to follow in the family business. Kelly Preston looks amazing as his flying super hero wife. A great group of kids play the Sky High students, with cool effects to help them into their roles... and some nice parables about life in high school. I expected lots of eye rolling and lame super hero humor... but there was no lameness, no eye rolls, but plenty of good laughs and sweet moments.

It was competently made, good effects, some comedic moments and good set pieces. But it just didn&apos;t feel like something derived from a SNL skit. The joy of ghostbusters was that it was free wheeeling, that it was anarchic. That, similar to the Blues Brothers, somebody had allowed a bunch of slackers to spend millions on making a movie which to coin Bill Murray from Meatballs &quot;just didn&apos;t matter&quot;. Afterlife was touching and sweet, looking back at that time with a smile and a wink. This however, was just a generic family action movie, using the brand name of the ghostbusters.

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Despite Irish ancestry, during my childhood, Ireland was vaguely described as a place to avoid due to the Northern Ireland Conflict (also known as The Troubles). In contrast, the childhood of writer-director Kenneth Branagh was smack dab in the middle of this political and religious mess. This autobiographical project is a sentimental look back at his youth and the connection to his career as a filmmaker. This is very attractive and appealing filmmaking, and one that acknowledges the violent atmosphere without dwelling on it.\n\nAn opening aerial view of present day Belfast shipyards in full color abruptly transitions back to black and white 1969. A young boy plays and skips cheerfully as he makes his way through the apparently idyllic neighborhood. The pleasantries are shattered and give way to the frenzied fear and havoc created by an approaching angry mob. The native Protestants&apos; goal is to push out all Catholics from the area. The happy young boy we first see is Buddy (played by newcomer Jude Hill), the stand-in for Branagh as a child. While watching, we must keep in mind that we are seeing things unfold through Buddy&apos;s eyes - which are actually the eyes of a middle-aged director looking back on his upbringing. This explains the sentimentality and nostalgia, two aspects handled exceedingly well.\n\nBuddy and his older brother Will (Lewis McAskie) live with their parents Ma (Caitriona Balfe, FORD V FERRARI, &quot;Outlander&quot;) and Pa (Jamie Dornan, &quot;The Fall&quot;), and are close with Granny (Oscar winner Judi Dench) and Pop (Ciaran Hinds, one of the finest supporting actors working today). Pa spends much of his time away in London working as a carpenter, leaving Ma parenting diligently to create normalcy for the boys during tumultuous times. An added stress is the financial woes Ma and Pa face over tax debt. Granny and Pop are an endearing elderly couple still very much in love, despite their constant needling and bickering.\n\nAs things escalate, the division over religion becomes more prevalent. Although he attempts to stay out of the fracas, Pa is faced with the &quot;either with us or against us&quot; decision - something he avoids as long as possible. Ma is obsessed with keeping her boys on the straight and narrow, despite their naivety and the many forces pulling them away. The family finds its emotional escape at the local cinema, which treats us to clips of bikini-clad Raquel Welch in ONE MILLION YEARS BC; Grace Kelly and Gary Cooper facing off with a similar &apos;stay or go&apos; dilemma in HIGH NOON; John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart and Lee Marvin in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE; and Dick Van Dyke in his flying car from CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG. The sense of awe and wonder is laid on a bit thick for effect, but it helps us connect young Buddy with present day Branagh.\n\nIt&apos;s quite a family dilemma. How do you decide to pack up and leave the only town you&apos;ve ever called home, and when do you make that decision? When does the danger and turmoil pose too much to risk for your kids? There is a fun scene that provides young Buddy a lesson on how to answer, &quot;Are you Protestant or Catholic?&quot; It plays comically but has a serious undertone. Speaking of Buddy, newcomer Jude Hall in his feature film debut, uses his sparkling eyes and an engaging smile to light up the screen. His adolescent pining for Catherine (Olive Tennant), the smart girl in his class, is worthy of the price of admission. All of the actors are terrific, and in addition to young Mr. Hall, it&apos;s Caitriona Balfe (as Ma) whose performance really stands out. Award considerations should be in her future.\n\nFilmmaker Branagh has assembled a crew of frequent collaborators, including cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos, who works wonders with the monochromatic scheme. The soundtrack is chock full of Van Morrison songs - it is Ireland, after all, and the overall feeling is that this is a film Branagh needed to make in order to deal with his childhood prior to his family relocating to England. By not avoiding The Troubles, yet not focusing on it, Branagh has told his story in a personal way that should be relatable to many. It&apos;s a terrific film.\n\nBELFAST opens in theaters on November 12, 2021.",

      "reviewBody": "What is it with this sudden surge of penguin movies appearing? Or penguins appearing in movies? I&apos;ve always found watching penguins on real life TV programmes to be very entertaining because they just seem, well there&apos;s no other word for it, cute. But just recently Hollywood has seemed to start to overuse them a tiny bit. March of the Penguins I suppose really kicked it all off. I can&apos;t see what all the fuss was about that documentary and quite why it was the success it was. But it was an interesting movie. Then came along Madagascar, while admittedly not completely about penguins the penguins that did feature were undoubtedly the best things in the entire movie. Since then penguin items, TV shows and penguins on our screens have been appearing like crazy. It reached its pinnacle in my eyes last year when Happy Feet arrived on our big screens. Now I really wanted to love Happy Feet, when I first watched it I actually did adore it. But after multiple viewings I realised something, it was actually pretty boring, and way too depressing at times for my liking. Its animations was beautiful, but it just didn&apos;t live up to its potential. When the first trailers for Surf&apos;s Up arrived I didn&apos;t know what to make of it. Dancing penguins is one things, surfing penguins is just plain ludicrous. I felt like Sony were merely cashing in on this penguin phenomenon. So what a pleasant surprise to find that Surf&apos;s Up is not only a movie that&apos;ll appeal to both kids and adults, but also the best animated movie of the year so far! The fact that its a surfing penguin movie didn&apos;t make it as good as it is, no the movie succeeds for daring to try something different. A mockumentary style movie somewhat reminiscent of Creature Comforts, trust me if you like Creature Comforts you will adore this movie. The script is well written, the voice cast absolutely brilliant, hell even the animation surprised me for being very well done. If it has one fault its that its obligatory sentimental streak felt a little bit too forced for my liking. Nevertheless this is a small fault in an otherwise enjoyable and very well made animated movie.\n\nThe voice cast of the movie are particularly brilliant. Shia Labeouf leads the cast as surfer wannabe Cody. Labeouf was until recently one of the few actors I could not stand to see on a screen. My past experiences with him on movies were usually films that cast him as the annoying kid. For this reason I couldn&apos;t stand him. However, then he starred in Transformers and changed my mind completely. He is actually a great actor, he can deliver a joke easily, he&apos;s easily likable and he just does everything in such a great way. This shines through again with his performance here, and because of his work in this movie I would be quite happy to see him lead another animated movie some time in the future. His character is always funny, he definitely gets some of the best lines and moments in the movie. Jeff Bridges is pretty good in his role, he works best in the funny moments of the films, when it comes to the sentimental stuff I just found his voice work to be not as good. Jon Heder almost runs off with the movie as Chicken Joe, who got the biggest laugh from the audience. Zooey Deschanel was average I suppose, her character deals more with the icky stuff towards the end than the great comedy stuff. James Woods seems to be having a great time as Reggie, he also gets some great comedy moments.\n\nThe actual comedy side of Surf&apos;s Up is perhaps the movie greatest success. The mockumentary style allows us to see a different way of making animated movies. The movie of course has to switch to a more movie-ish feel at some points, its in these moments the movie isn&apos;t at its best. Whenever they&apos;re doing the documentary style the movie is as perfect as you could hope for. Meeting Cody&apos;s family at the beginning is pretty hilarious, and meeting all the other supporting characters, especially Tank who has the best scene of the movie with his trophies, is definitely the movies highlights. If you are planning to see this I highly suggest you watch the characters in the background more so than the characters in the foreground, they made me laugh all the time to see them waving at the camera or pulling faces behind the other characters backs. Chicken Joe is definitely best comically, the best scene with him involves a hot tub and the natives, its pretty hilarious, a shame most of the joke is ruined in the trailers.\n\nSo what are the negatives of the movie then? Well I suppose if I look at this from a kids point of view then I realise that there are a lot of jokes that might leave the kids a bit cold. The kids will still be entertained for the majority of the movie, especially during the very cool looking surfing sequences, but some of the humour is more directly aimed at adults than anyone else. Also the sentimentality factor obviously starts to kick in towards the end. While its never sickly like a lot of other animated movies are, it still feels a tad forced. I wish for once we could have a kids movie without all the obligatory kiss and make up feel at the end of it. Why can&apos;t everyone just still hate each other or something like that? Anyway the sentimentality never makes the film bad at all, its still a great movie.",

Wiseman is supposed to cost ...$400,000,000 and American Ultra had a budget of $28,000,000 but it doesn&apos;t show...\n\nThe movie has an amateurish style and direction. It is aesthetically not pleasing and it looks like they shot it in a parking lot over the course of a weekend.\n\nI&apos;m not a fan of Kristen Stewart but I consider her a good actress with a broad range of facial expressions and emotions and she delivers in this movie too. Topher Grace is adequate too but the rest of the cast looks like they prefer to be somewhere else including Connie Britton and the veteran Bill Pullman.\n\nThere are some actions scenes where the mighty spy kicks some ass but overall the movie fails to produce a satisfying result.\n\nMaybe in the hands of a more capable director and a reworked script (written by the son of John Landis) this movie could be better. At least for 90 minutes of action fun..."

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. The 1964 classic Disney film MARY POPPINS is much beloved and has been shared across generations for more than 50 years. It won 5 Oscars on 13 nominations, and shifted Julie Andrews from a Broadway star to an international movie star, as she won the Oscar for Best Actress while becoming the ideal nanny for most every boy and girl. Rarely do reboots, remakes, or sequels to the classics make much of a dent with the movie-going public, but it&apos;s likely director Rob Marshall&apos;s (CHICAGO, INTO THE WOODS) film will be an exception. Marshall balances nostalgia with contemporary, and benefits from a marvelous successor to the Mary Poppins role ... Emily Blunt.\n\nThe film opens in low-key fashion as we follow Jack (Lin-Manuel Miranda) through town as he performs his lamplighting duties singing the melancholic &quot;Underneath the Lovely London Sky&quot;. It&apos;s actually a bit of a dry opening that may have some impatient kids wondering why their parents dragged them to see this. Soon after, we are at the familiar 17 Cherry Tree Lane - the Banks&apos; home - easily recognizable from the original film. We meet grown up siblings Michael (Ben Whishaw) and Jane (Emily Mortimer). Jane is a labor organizer following in her mom&apos;s footsteps, and Michael is a struggling artist and widower raising 3 kids. He has taken a teller job at the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank where his dad (now deceased) worked, but mostly he&apos;s an emotional wreck. In fact, the only way to save the family home from foreclosure is with proof of his father&apos;s bank shares ... something the evil new Bank President, William Weatherall Wilkins (Colin Firth), conspires to prevent.\n\nIt&apos;s at this point that the kids&apos; popcorn should just about be gone, so it&apos;s fortunate that our beloved nanny makes her timely appearance ... literally floating (with practically perfect posture) into the park where Georgie (an adorable Joel Dawson) and lamplighter Jack are flying a very recognizable kite. Jack, having been an apprentice under Bert the Chimney Sweep, is quite familiar with the significance of Mary Poppins&apos; arrival. Back on Cherry Tree Lane, Michael and Jane are shocked to see their childhood nanny back in the house, and Michael&apos;s two spunky twins Anabel (Pixie Davies) and John (Nathanael Saleh) aren&apos;t sure what to make of this mysterious visitor.\n\nDirector Marshall wisely utilizes the template from the original film, so many of the subsequent sequences have a familiar and cozy feel to them. Mary Poppins&apos; &quot;Off we go&quot; kicks off a fantastical bathtub adventure and leads to the first of many smile-inducing, visually spectacular moments. A broken porcelain bowl guides us to a beautiful hand-drawn animation (from Walt Disney Studios) sequence with horse-drawn carriage, penguins, and more. Meryl Streep performs &quot;Turning Turtle&quot; in her topsy-turvy studio, and there is an extended (perhaps a bit too long) dance sequence featuring Jack and the other lamplighters singing &quot;Trip a Little Light Fantastic&quot;.\n\nJulie Walters appears as the Banks&apos; housekeeper and David Warner is Admiral Boom, the Banks&apos; canon-firing neighbor; however it&apos;s two cameos that will really hit home with the older viewers: Angela Landsbury (not in the original) is the balloon lady singing &quot;Nowhere to Go but Up&quot;, and the remarkable Dick Van Dyke (a huge part of the original) plays an elderly Mr. Dawes Jr from the bank - and even performs a dance routine atop a desk. All of the actors perform admirably, yet this is clearly Emily Blunt&apos;s movie. She shines as the practically perfect nanny, whether debating with her umbrella, digging in her mystical baggage, filling heads with &apos;stuff and nonsense&apos;, teaching life lessons to those in need, or singing solo and with others. It&apos;s a wonderful performance and she becomes Mary Poppins for a new generation.\n\nDirector Marshall co-wrote the story and screenplay with David Magee and John DeLuca, and they have created a worthy sequel (a quite high standard) from P.L. Travers&apos; original books that is delightful and a joy to watch. The group of original songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman serve the story fine, but the one downside to the film is that none of the new songs are as catchy or memorable as those of the Sherman Brothers (Richard and Robert) from 54 years ago. They won Oscars for Best Score and Song (&quot;Chim Chim Che-ree&quot;), and left us singing others such as &quot;Spoon Full of Sugar&quot;, &quot;Let&apos;s Go Fly a Kite&quot; and of course, &quot;Supercalifragilistic&quot;. These new songs including &quot;Can You Imagine That&quot;, &quot;The Place Where Lost Things Go&quot;, &quot;A Cover is not the Book&quot;, &quot;Nowhere to Go but Up&quot; all contribute to the story and to the viewer&apos;s enjoyment, but none leave us singing or humming as we depart the theatre.\n\nThis is a film where those behind-the-scenes are crucial to its success. Oscar winning cinematographer Dion Beebe (MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA) and Editor Wyatt Smith both are at the top of their game, and Costume Designer Sandy Powell delivers stunners, not just for the singing nanny, but for all characters. The core of the story remains rediscovering the magic in life, and finding joy in each other - and this sequel also provides the adventures to match the original. It&apos;s simultaneously familiar and fresh, which is key to a successful follow up to a beloved classic. Director Marshall has signed on to Disney&apos;s live action THE LITTLE MERMAID, but it&apos;s with MARY POPPINS RETURNS where he has delivered a film that is practically perfect in every way.",

Sure, it&apos;s a B-movie and has its flaws - it&apos;s a bit silly, it&apos;s not particularly horrifying (although I must admit no movie has scared me in 10-15 years, and I&apos;ve watched quite a lot of horror flicks), it&apos;s a tad silly (Ghostbusters meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer?). But as B-horror movies go, this one is entertaining for those who like films with supernatural phenomena and people dying in &quot;imaginative&quot; ways. Actually, Thir13en Ghosts reminded me of one of my favourite films, The Cube. But that&apos;s just the reason I can&apos;t give a lot of points for this movie - there are better B-movies with which to entertain yourself. Cube-films sum up the better parts of the film and dispense with boring love-issues. But then again, there are heck of a lot more crappier films than this, and it was funny enough for me to even buy it for five or so euros in case I came across this in a store.",

      "reviewBody": "I didn&apos;t absolutely hate Garfield 1, but I personally thought the film wasn&apos;t that great. The first problem is that the plot is as thin as a piece of cardboard and rather slow-moving. Bill Murray does his best with rather superficial material, but at times he sounds rather monotonic. While the script isn&apos;t completely devoid of humour, it is very uneven, and while kids will like the jokes, adults won&apos;t find much to go on. Stephen Tobolowsky&apos;s villain, despite having some good delivery, just doesn&apos;t quite convince, likewise with Brekin Meyer as Jon.\n\nHowever, there are several redeeming merits, the most obvious one being Oadie the dog. I am 17, but I still found him so adorable, especially when he started dancing on his hind legs. Another obvious plus is the always lovely Jennifer Love Hewitt as Liz, who has been in a number of duds, but still shines because of her endearing personality and beauty. I also thought there were some well chosen locations, and while the film on the whole wasn&apos;t very funny, the scene when Garfield is blown so hard into the air-conditioning duct that his face gets stamped into the metal was very funny indeed.\n\nOverall, not a bad movie, but not a particularly good one either. I don&apos;t really recommend this other than for Jennifer Love Hewitt, Oadie or if you&apos;re a Garfield fan, but I did enjoy the sequel more. 4/10 for a brave attempt to bring a comic book to the big screen.

      "reviewBody": "The Painted Veil is my favorite Somerset Maugham novel so I was concerned about how much justice could be done to this hauntingly beautiful story of revenge, love and redemption. Is it possible to take a masterpiece and make a decent film out of it in Hollywood? Apparently yes! Could the movie have been better - absolutely, but does it get the job done well? I&apos;d say yes.\n\nEd Norton is Walter - a bacteriologist stationed in Shangai. In Londn he mets and falls in love with the beautiful Kitty (Naomi Watts), hasty marriage and honeymoon in Venice later they are both in China. He is busy - she is bored. And what better way to relieve boredom than an extramarital affair with Charlie - the philandering consular official (Liev Schrieber)? But Walter discovers the affair and decides to volunteer to a cholera stricken province and take Kitty with him. Charlie was never serious anyway so off they go into the jaws of death. In the cholera infested back of beyond Walter and Kitty discover more about each other than they did in many months of marriage. A mutual respect grows into something else but it is a cholera infested region after all. So the tale must have a tragic ending and it does. But it leaves one with a sense of relief as the camera finally moves away from the oppressive dark tones and into light.\n\nThe movie has beautiful performances by Ed Norton and Ms. Watts. His serious, then almost sinister, then enlighetened Walter is the perfect foil to her luminous, wicked and then vulnerable Kitty. Liev Schrieber is good in the brief role as Charlie and all the supporting cast is very good indeed. The locale is stunning and the mood is brilliantly captured in the dark, the shadows and moments of light.\n\nAre there Hollywood moments? Of course there are, mostly during the growing attraction between the lead pair there are the clichéd moments of &quot;intoxication&quot;, his looking suddenly more attractive and youthful, her moments with the orphanage kids. But none of it is over the top. The movie is full of mood, sensuous beauty and emotion. I enjoyed the film and I think Mr. Maugham is there somewhere nodding his head in approval at a job well done.",

      "reviewBody": "People misunderstood &quot;The Color of Money,&quot; I think. There are a few things to keep in mind: \n\n1) This was a Martin Scorsese film. Scorsese was fresh off &quot;Taxi Driver,&quot; &quot;Raging Bull,&quot; and other such successes from less than a decade before. People were expecting a lot.\n\n2) It starred Paul Newman, returning to his character from &quot;The Hustler,&quot; in a sequel that was twenty-five years in the making. That&apos;s longer than the wait for the &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; prequel.\n\nPerhaps for those two (very strong) reasons alone, when &quot;The Color of Money&quot; opened in 1986, the critics and audiences didn&apos;t think much of it. It garnered decent praise from both areas but most critics seemed to agree: it didn&apos;t hold a candle to &quot;The Hustler,&quot; and anyone other than Scorsese could have easily made the same picture.\n\nAfter 19 years, I disagree. I think &quot;The Color of Money&quot; is not only an intelligent and amusing character piece, but an excellent continuation of a character we haven&apos;t seen for 25 years.\n\nFirst of all, Scorsese&apos;s direction isn&apos;t his best, but it&apos;s still very good. And he&apos;s definitely got the same elements going on as &quot;After Hours&quot; from a few years before -- his cinematography is identical and the dark colors and grainy &apos;80s vibe are present in every frame. Likewise he&apos;s using the quick-cuts and zooms and iconic panning shots that he&apos;s known for. The thing is, Scorsese&apos;s styles just changed a bit during the 1980s (they even carried on into &quot;GoodFellas&quot; -- the night-time shots carry the same foreboding look as &quot;After Hours&quot; and &quot;Color of Money&quot;). I think now, looking back, since we&apos;ve seen more of Scorsese&apos;s films, it&apos;s easier to notice that this is indeed a Martin Scorsese film. A man who is constantly changing his directorial approach. (Just look at &quot;The Aviator&quot; for goodness sake!) Newman deserved the Oscar more for &quot;The Hustler,&quot; of course, but for what it&apos;s worth, Fast Eddie Felson&apos;s evolution is handled with care in the script and it&apos;s very entertaining (for anyone who&apos;s seen the original) to note the change in his behavior. It&apos;s also interesting to see the new cocky pool hustler, Vince (Tom Cruise), filling in the shoes of Eddie from a few decades before.\n\nIf &quot;The Hustler&quot; was a great insight into the life of a troubled young man, then &quot;The Color of Money&quot; is a terrific insight into the evolution of this man, and the contrast between the young and the old. All adults tell us as children that they were just like us at one time, and we don&apos;t believe them. &quot;The Color of Money&quot; follows this principal -- in thirty years, we all know Vince will be just like Fast Eddie: wise and matured. And then he&apos;ll probably be coaching a young guy who thinks he&apos;s the king of the world. Will they make another sequel based on this continuation of the story? I doubt it. It&apos;s unnecessary, because as far as I&apos;m concerned &quot;The Color of Money&quot; has already stressed the point. But you never know...\n\nOverall this isn&apos;t a great movie and I won&apos;t pretend it is. But I do think it&apos;s one of the better films to come out of the 1980s and had a lot more going for it than some of the critics gave it credit for. Film buffs should see it, especially those who loved &quot;The Hustler.&quot;",

Criticisms include inconsistent pacing, underdeveloped characters, and genre commitment issues. Some applaud its unique X-Men universe approach, strong performances, and intriguing plot elements. Others find it disappointing due to clichés, lack of tension, and perceived flaws in direction and writing.

It does have an Easter egg that would make it better if it released earlier. It does have some horror aspects, so this is the X-Men movie I recommend to horror fans. I find it good that they finally did something with Magik. It&apos;ll be better if was more about her. I would also find it better if it has more connections to the greater X-Men franchise with Magik being Colossus&apos;s sister and there being a small tie to Logan. It can feel a little short in my opinion. It&apos;ll be better if it&apos;s a half hour or a full one longer and having that R rating, leaning a little more into the blood and possibly a scene of full rear nudity.",

      "reviewBody": "They think they have just made them all better parties, but to their parents and to admittedly, reality, brothers Mike (Zac Efron) and Dave (Adam Devine) have only ruined all of the family events they&apos;ve participated in for their wild party style. So when its Jaine&apos;s (Sugar Lyn Beard) turn to get married the family is taking no risks: Mike and Dave are to bring wedding dates to the wedding in order to be kept at bay. That&apos;s when Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) put on the façade of being nice and ordinary girls to score a free weekend in Hawaii after discovering an advert from the two brothers. Yet when the chaotic spirits of both pairs start to explode, an apparently normal weekend turns into a ludicrous series of events.\n\n&quot;Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates&quot; has good and charismatic leads, with natural comedic timing and an appropriately funny cast built around them with a script that has some effortlessly funny gags working. Yet, a fair amount of laughs are not enough to surmount the film&apos;s lack of heart, which often transpires into both annoying and unmotivated sequences and humor which is close to being mean spirited.\n\nWhat severely lacks from the film is a fresh and interesting comedic voice. As much as you feel the director&apos;s passion, I couldn&apos;t help but feel very cold about the style and visual choices the film makes. It is directed with almost no life, it doesn&apos;t feel alive and breathing, the shot choice is for the majority so basic it made my head ache at some point. There aren&apos;t any passages in the film where you feel inspired filmmaking and character or story being given a chance to flow. The editing is very mechanical and brings the film into feeling more like a series of gags, which might be occasionally good, but lack any kind of drive given the very predictable and clichéd script.\n\nStill, there&apos;s no denying the talent almost everybody has for comedy and even when handed what for most is very average material they manage to elevate it and thanks to what is sure to be a lot of improvisation they make the scenes that work, work really well and transcend what are otherwise deeply problematic character development elements. Efron&apos;s career has lately been all about these R-rated comedies and I have to admit I am one who really enjoys his effort in these: he is a great screen presence and always brings a palpable irony to the scenes. Adam Devine at this point is an enigma for me, I have no idea where he&apos;ll go in the future, that is because he has some really borderline annoying stuff here, but I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s thanks to him or the gag in itself I was never brought to a breaking point. I enjoyed probably all of his beats and he had many different ones to bring alive, succeeding in all of that variety.\n\nWhat is frustrating about the movie is how standard it feels and how much everything around it is striving to be better, but what we end up is this basic studio comedy that goes through every single beat we except and leaves the audience with little passion at all. The premise is right, the talent behind cast well, the script is trying to go to fresh places occasionally, but there is an incredible aura of average all around that simply flattens the film to the point of annoyance. Not to mention the ridiculous quantity of screeching women all over the place that had me almost covering my ears.\n\n&quot;Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates&quot; is a film that delivers some good and at times great laughs thus succeeding a laugh prompter, yet a comedy film it lacks any depth of character or story to make it live any further than its closing credits unfortunately.",

      "reviewBody": "After watching most of the recent action movies, I left the theatre with a headache brought on by incredibly tight/shaky shots and edits so fast that any hope of seeing anything is lost.  This movie takes a step back from that.  It isn&apos;t entirely devoid of those annoyances, but is much better than most.  In fact, at times, you can even see a whole string of punches and blocks without a cut or a shake!  Of course there is the inevitable wire work, that combined with the necessary special effects to allow Jet Li to fight himself.  But for once there is an excuse other than &quot;because we can&quot;.\n\nThe story is pretty simple.  A murdering criminal is killing all the copies of himself in all the other &quot;universes&quot;.  Each time one dies the life force/resonant string thing, gets divided amoungst the survivors.  Of course this leaves a ton of questions that aren&apos;t addressed at all in the movie, but I can live with that since those are more topics for debate after having fun at the movie.  That is one of the strengths of the movie, the progressively more intense action.  As the movie progress, rather than trying to deal with any question the viewer might have, the pace and intensity of the movie goes up.  The final action sequence is probably ten minutes long all told, which, to me, is a sign of a true action movie, as opposed to movies with action.\n\nOverall I give it a 8/10 for fans of the genre.  If you aren&apos;t particularly interested in sci-fi/martial arts, especially if you have a problem with wire work and blue-screens, then you might want to skip it.",

      "reviewBody": "Not every film is supposed to make you review your life and become a missionary. This is pure escapism but without heaps of gadgets and blatant CGI.\n\nIt looks good , the stars look great and the supporting cast do what they&apos;re supposed to and a little more. The script made me laugh a lot more than the slightly overrated &apos;Hangover&apos;. \n\nKatherine Heigl was a surprise for me, a grown up Marilyn, and since seeing Ashton Kutcher in &apos;Dude&apos;, I was happy to see a different side. Yes the story IS simple but most plots are and it&apos;s the delivery that counts.\n\nYet there were still some unpredictable moments. I was entertained and would definitely recommended this to unwind to after a stressful day at the office. \n\nGreat date movie too."

Jackson) gets up to, but then again, with some rationalizing we easily reach the conclusion that we simply don&apos;t know just how far America has gone in the legal torture business.\n\nWe do not intend to point the finger at America in particular. This applies to any and everyone. Faced with extenuating circumstances, what would we do? Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen. &quot;Unthinkable&quot; is a very current, undebatably intense uneasy ride down a steep, winding and twisting tunnel.\n\nIn the end we are left with nothing.

      "reviewBody": "Just when we think the gush of Christmas commercials and specials are over, along comes LAST CHRISTMAS, and if ever there were a film that could enchant, this is one that does. Written by Emma Thompson (who also plays a significant role in the movie) and Greg Wise with screenplay adaptation aided by Bryony Kimmings, the film seems a bit of fluff, overly decorated, until the messages begin to sink in. And by the end the film is elevating, thanks to some fine acting and direction. George Michael&apos;s music plays a primary role, also.\n\nKatrina/Kate (Emilia Clarke) is a young woman subscribed to bad decisions. Working as an elf in a year round Christmas store owned by &apos;Santa&apos; (Michele Yeoh) is not good for the wannabe singer. However, there she meets Tom (Henry Golding), a kind-hearted man with a mysterious past who challenges her cynical worldview. Kate slowly comes to realize that Tom is &apos;significant&apos; and her life takes a new turn. For Kate, it seems too good to be true. Completing the entourage is Kate&apos;s Yugoslavian immigrant family - mother Petra (Emma Thompson), father Ivan (Boris Isakovic) and sister Marta (Lydia Leonard) - each with conflicts and problems of their own. It all comes together with a discovery (one that should not be shared) and the grand finale at the homeless sanctuary is rich in honest goodwill - &apos;helping each other.&apos;\n\nThis is a feel good movie, well acted, and one that can be uplifting - if you&apos;ve a mind to be uplifted!",

      "reviewBody": "This movie had a lot of potential. While technically impressive and very enjoyable with some genuinely funny moments, for some reason it falls short. Of course there are redeeming qualities, such as the fun music score by Danny Elfman, one of my all time favourite film composers and an amusing turn from Robin Williams. Also the special effects are greatly improved from the effects in the Absent Minded Professor, and Flubber who is so cute steals the show. The performances from Clancy Brown, Ted Levine and Marcia Gay Horden are entertaining, and Jodi Benson (who voiced Ariel in the Little Mermaid)is a delight as the voice of Weebo, whose death is absolutely heart-rending. However the story is very predictable, and offers few surprises, and the physical comedy was better than the patchy script which in places felt uninspired. That saying some of the physical comedy has strong hints of deja vu, and is rather hit and miss. Of course kids will lap it up, but adults probably won&apos;t like it as much. The second half of the movie is more meandering in quality compared to the first half, very little of interest happens and some of the situations come across as ridiculous. All in all, somewhat forgettable, but for a kids movie it is pretty entertaining. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Now, let&apos;s not get carried away here: is this the best horror flick ever? Not that I&apos;ve seen.  Does it sometimes trip over the fine line between scares and laughs?  Sure.  Will it remind people of certain other movies? Probably.  But bottom line, is this movie a blast?  Absolutely.\n\nWriter/director Rob Zombie&apos;s music has always had a kind of comic book/horror movie sensibility which he translates into his screen project, a tribute to the pioneering take-no-prisoners classics of the 1970&apos;s like &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; and &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre,&quot; in fact a prominent role is played by Bill Moseley of &quot;TCM II.&quot;  We&apos;re informed at the outset that it&apos;s Halloween Eve 1977 in some one-horse town in an unspecified region of the country (which of course allows each actor to use any accent he or she likes, even within the same household).  The chief attraction of this town seems to be a &quot;horror museum&quot; run by a Captain Spaulding (who bears no resemblance to Groucho Marx) played by veteran B-movie stalwart Sid Haig, whom I recall from way the hell back in &quot;Busting&quot; as the big menacing bald guy.  He&apos;s still big and bald but not so much menacing as jovially deranged with undercurrents of menace (and lots of make-up).  After a delightfully overwritten robbery sequence involving a couple of local yokels, four fresh-faced young people with one foot in the grave show up at the museum, setting in motion a series of unpleasant events.\n\nNo particular reason to dwell on the plot, especially if you&apos;ve seen &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; and/or it&apos;s sequels.  It&apos;s the tried-and-true damsels (and their boyfriends) in distress.  (We even get a pack of cheerleaders thrown in as a bonus.  Apparently people have been going missing in this town but back in the Seventies the term &quot;serial killer&quot; was waiting to be invented, so no squads of Feds and profilers have arrived.)   For movies like this to work, the actors have to be on the same page in tone; aside from Haig and Moseley I barely knew anyone except Walt Goggins from TV&apos;s &quot;The Shield&quot; and of course Karen Black, whose performance is the only one that doesn&apos;t quite click.  It&apos;s like she&apos;s playing a whack job where the others are just being whack jobs.  (But if they ever wanted to remake &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,&quot;  there&apos;s your girl!)   In terms of direction, Zombie takes a kind of kitchen-sink approach; some of it reminded me of Oliver Stone&apos;s &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; and others of that ilk, with the eye-blink jumping to and from videotape, color variations, flashback and/or fantasy, etc.  Some of the editing&apos;s a little too jumbled in the modern trend of trying to obscure what&apos;s happening, although not to the &quot;Darkness Falls&quot; degree of complete chaos.  (I&apos;m old-fashioned, I still think the best way to scare you with something in a movie is just train the camera on it so you can see it coming at you with no way to escape.)  But Mr. Zombie has a nice feel for where to put the camera and how to move a scene along. Some of his sequences have a kind of sinister poetry to them, like when the two deputies go checking out the homestead from hell, the kind of setup we&apos;ve seen in how many shlock items (I just saw one in a recent victim of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 crew) but in this case Zombie replaces all sound with a Slim Whitman tune (we recall how Whitman&apos;s voice was enough to slay big-brained Martians a while back) and holds the final crane shot an audaciously long time.  Then once the coffin gets lowered into the water towards the end, &quot;House&quot; kicks into overdrive and from then on if there&apos;s nothing in the movie that spooks you, then maybe you&apos;re unspookable.  I know a lot of that imagery will be lingering with me for a while, such as Fish Boy.....\n\nOrdinarily I try to ignore a movie&apos;s external circumstances and go by what&apos;s on the screen in front of me but in this case it&apos;s pointless to pretend this movie has not been in limbo for three years due to it&apos;s supposedly violent content.  I&apos;ve read it had to be cut to make the R rating, although I really can&apos;t see how an NC-17 would&apos;ve hurt it; people will go see it partly because it&apos;s by Rob Zombie and it&apos;s said to be gory and for those put off by such factors, an R rating won&apos;t make them less put off.  &quot;Hey, honey, it&apos;s an R now--forget the babysitter, let&apos;s bring the kids!&quot;   I&apos;ve also read Zombie was satisfied with the released version.  As released, there&apos;s really nothing there you haven&apos;t seen before in some form or other; some gore fans may even feel let down, but of course there&apos;s always the DVD.  I think that had it been released as made three years ago without all the hype, with the chance to &quot;sneak up on&quot; us, it would&apos;ve been even more effective.  But maybe that&apos;s what the studio feared?  Well, Mr. Movie Mogul, if you&apos;re going to commission the guy from White Zombie to do a horror flick, what exactly do you anticipate as a result?  Please either defecate or get off the toilet....\n\nHard to nail down a favorite moment with this one, but it&apos;s hard to resist picking the youngsters getting abused in their bunny suits.  It&apos;s visually striking, it&apos;s unusual, it&apos;s blackly funny and also somewhat unsettling the more you think about it.  When we watch a horror flick, what exactly are we anticipating?  Is the one-sided nature of the conflict (overwhelming villain, hapless or helpless victim) part of the appeal for us?  Do we &quot;identify with&quot; the chaser or the chasee? Should we feel a little ashamed of ourselves afterwards?  Or, as Captain Spaulding put it, are these just a bunch of jack-ass questions?\n\nGreat soundtrack, I may have to buy it...."

With non-stop music, dancing, hugs, and trippy hairdos, these Trolls know how to keep it PLUR! \n\nI&apos;m not usually a big fan of musicals, but this movie has a nice variety of songs and keeps them short, fun, and too the point. Never a moment to get bored. Most of the songs are very cliché, generic, pop songs, but they are catchy and upbeat, so it&apos;s hard to complain.\n\nAnna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake have great chemistry and put a lot of personality into the characters. I think they nailed it.\n\nI feel like the team that made this movie did a great job collaborating between the writing, acting, and animation to create lots of really great moments for characters that a truly hilarious. Unlike most comedies, this one seems to get funnier each time I watch it. I can&apos;t get enough of the fun characters and find myself smiling throughout the day thinking of the great moments in this film.\n\nCreative musical numbers like &quot;Sounds of Darkness&quot; perfectly complement hilarious comedy scenes like the encounter with M. Cloud, and lead me to believe that the guys who directed this movie have a lot of talent. \n\nI&apos;m surprised this film doesn&apos;t have a higher rating. I really can&apos;t think of what is not to like, but I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s just one of those things where you either love it or hate it. I can see it becoming somewhat of a cult classic.

Oddly the film which by the way has lost all the laughs the play engendered, presents a much more serious and grim portrait. Meryl the magnificent is not so magnificent in this though she at times grasps the inner feeling of the mother. Unfortunately, she also tends to go way over the top a few too many times. Julia Roberts has been directed in a more angry and vindictive manner than the original Tony winning actress I saw on stage. I always love Julia but this is not her most pleasant role. The humor has been left on the stage and not made its way to the screen. At least the film avoids the glib, &quot;oh, look at me, I am so clever&quot; feeling of the play.",

      "reviewBody": "Around the World in 80 Days (2004), starring Jackie Chan, currently has an IMDb user rating of 5.7. And they say it&apos;s one of the biggest flops in history, having failed to recoup more than a fraction of its (estimated) $110 million budget.\n\nI say, give it time! Overseas box office plus rentals and DVD sales - this movie will turn a profit in the end. As I understand it, movie companies now make most of their money off the rental market, so I am rather mystified to hear that a movie flopped just because it didn&apos;t earn back its cost at the U.S. box office in the first couple of months of release. Doesn&apos;t seem like a fair and complete calculation to me.\n\nAnyway, I go to the trouble of wondering about this because I thought this was a great and delightful romp of a comedy, and I believe posterity will be much kinder to it than &quot;5.7&quot;. The movie is witty, beautiful, well-acted and contains virtually everything any kung fu adventure fan&apos;s heart can desire. Before watching it, I thought it would be more faithful to the original book, so I was surprised to see the Ten Tigers of Kwantung, and let me say the surprise was 100% positive. This movie is, absolutely first and foremost, a comedy. And it is something so rare as a literate one, which does not ridicule the premise it is based on. The movie makes the only right choice, namely to update the classic story and add new levels and new ideas, which keeps it fresh and adventurous. Let&apos;s face it, Jules Verne&apos;s science no longer holds up in the present day, so we have to make modified versions of the stories for a modern audience (hence also the very entertaining updated version of Journey to the Center of the Earth: The Core).\n\nTo see this movie as a remake of the 1956 movie - which seems to be the position that many reviewers take - is completely faulty. This is a riff/homage to the original novel, having nothing whatsoever to do with any previous movie version.\n\nI thought Jackie Chan&apos;s part in this movie was great fun, and I was very entertained throughout. I can&apos;t think why it bombed in the U.S. I&apos;m gonna get it on DVD very soon.",

The film is lauded for its Gothic atmosphere and stylish photography. However, criticisms arise for its reliance on clichés, weak storyline, and predictable scares. The limited screen time for Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga is disappointing, and some feel it falls short of earlier Conjuring Universe films.",

The two killers try to outdo each other as they seize and destroy their trophy captives. As with most mysteries, this one has the usual red herrings, false leads and dead ends. Freeman is excellent as Alex Cross and heroine Judd is a study in grit and survival and is very effective in a finely nuanced role. The supporting cast is also great in a movie that has a leisurely pace and several great action scenes as it peaks towards its conclusion. The North Carolina location lensing, music score and cinematography are all very good.",

      "reviewBody": "I kid you not. If you want a hearty laugh, stick around as the end credits roll and listen to the full Robocop themesong which has about 2.5 minutes of people singing ROBO-COPPPPP!!! Fine, you say, maybe this is a tongue-in-cheek satire like the 60s Batman tv show? Not quite. This flick takes itself pretty seriously, which is where it fails.\n\nAside from some awesome campy tv news and commercial cutaways, exactly as in the original, this installment of Robocop lacks the cheeky wit and dark humor of its predecessor. Also gone are the characteristic, personable (lovable?) villains and the deep sociopolitical skewering that made the first Robo a timeless classic. Instead here we get a straightforward plot based bang-em-up showcase which can be entertaining in its own right, but it&apos;s not a true Robocop experience. The most noticeable failure is that the bad guys are entirely cardboard: a mysterious but never fleshed out messiah character, a little kid who is wonderfully cold-hearted at first but his character turns sappy, and a ditzy tagalong who is a groan worthy stereotype of the 80s token female sidekick, right down to the hysterical crying (yes I&apos;m describing one of the villains).\n\nPeter Weller does a great job within his limitations, but here the script really kneecapped him. It gave Weller a few promising themes of emotional conflict but barely a taste before moving on, never a good central theme for Weller and the audience to grasp. A dozen appetizers but no main course. Similarly, the story itself is a pastiche of episodic subplots which introduce themselves and are quickly resolved before moving on to the next. For example, the intriguing subplot of Robo stalking his widow is introduced at the outset but hastily resolved and never revisited. 5 minutes, move on. The excellent subplot of Robo being reprogrammed--literally his personality changed--by the corporate suits is really powerful but also hastily resolved and never touched again. 5 minutes, move on. The result is a sort of Readers Digest version of a complete film, with good bits to whet our appetite but without giving us a full course. Watch it if you just want to see a vanilla 80s action flick, but that&apos;s all it really offers.\n\nIn closing... *sings* ROBO--COPPP!! ROBOOOO--COPPPP!!!! ROOOOBOOOO--aw stuff a sock innit already.",

      "reviewBody": "This was a surprisingly intense film that I&apos;m so glad I watched. The concept was great and this was even before I found out it was based on a true story. But once I heard that it makes me want to look into it a lot more and see what differed from actual life and such. Supposedly the movie was pretty accurate though. It&apos;s amazing that good foreign films blow the socks off of most Hollywood garbage any day of the week. They&apos;re more realistic and the characters act more like real people would in day to day situations. The love story in this might&apos;ve been the only thing that I think could&apos;ve been done better since it became a little weird here and there. Other than that the suspense kept me going and the thought that this could happen to anyone is really scary to ponder. I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;d like to see this made into an American version only because I&apos;m quite positive they&apos;d butcher it and wouldn&apos;t contain anything near the desired effect as has usually been the case in the past. It was kept simple and because of that...it worked! The acting was great all around as it really was a job well done.\n\nFinal Import:\n\nMovies: Not a possibility here in the U.S.\n\nDVD Purchase: Worth looking into.\n\nRental: A wise choice my friend!",

      "reviewBody": "This diesel-punk film picks up on a conspiracy theory of Nazi&apos;s on the moon.... Yes, that&apos;s right! In 1945 Nazi&apos;s launched a plan so epic that it takes until 2018 for it to be uncovered. They have a secret moon base on the dark side of the moon, from where they have been mining resource and building an army of flying saucers that could once again pose a threat to humanity on Earth. US astronauts accidentally uncover the base but soon regret it as they find themselves fighting for their life trying to escape, while also fighting for humanity too. The Nazi&apos;s are only a few steps away from global domination, but they decide that now is the time to act - a plan is set in motion for officers to get the equipment they need to launch the full scale war on Earth.\n\nThis is an absurd B-movie sci-fi film which takes inspiration from lots of 1950&apos;s sci-fi films - this is clearly evident with the steam punk look of the Nazi&apos;s moon base which is based on 1950&apos;s technology. It is filled with plot holes and bad logic, it&apos;s wrong on so many levels - but it actually works in its own way. Intentionally camp and cheesy with lots of hammed up but superb acting, with over the top but stylish CGI and effects. This film certainly won&apos;t be for everyone, but if you are in that small percentage of film fans that like this kind of cr@p (like me) then you are likely to love this refreshing film which pokes fun at itself, and everything that can be poked.\n\nAs I have alluded to, the visuals are great, this was intended to be a visual movie and it delivers on that. Superb green screen work, but to an almost Hollywood level - great effects and CGI. It&apos;s interesting to note that this film uses almost double the amount of CGI shots as the first Michael Bay &quot;Transformers&quot; film and almost the same as &quot;Spider Man 3&quot; (this uses over 800 CGI shots), but for a fraction of the cost because it used low budget techniques rather than big studios.\n\nThe level of humour in the film is satirical and excellent, yes, it&apos;s occasionally slapstick too, but not enough for me to put it in a slapstick movie category. The film doesn&apos;t just poke fun at itself but also the modern political systems rife in the western worlds. While there is an obvious pantomime villain in the Nazi&apos;s the film does much more than pit good guys against bad guys. It looks at motives, it looks at outcomes, it looks at who the actual bad guys are, and where their decisions can ultimately take humanity. It&apos;s almost on a Dr Strangelove level in saying &quot;yes this is who we are, you should fear what we represent, oh but by the way, you are one of us too and you didn&apos;t know it&quot;. Similarly, in a &quot;1984&quot; way it raises the question of who is pulling the strings, and what are their intentions - should they be listened to?\n\nTimo Vuorensola, the creator of &quot;Star Wreck&quot;, has done justice directing this film and presented something epic for budget they had. Produced by Blind Spot Pictures from Finland, they have made a Finnish/ German/ and Australian co-produced film for 7.5 millions euros, but it&apos;s worth noting that this is still a fan fueled film. 10-15% of the budget came from the people who go to movies rather than investors. At the time of it&apos;s release this was the biggest budget for a Finnish film. The musical score by Slovenian band Laibach fits perfectly with the film, making the whole thing a fantastical concept experience. I&apos;ll be honest, this is my first experience of them, but it hopefully won&apos;t be my last experience.\n\nIn the acting stakes, Julia Dietze and Christopher Kirby steal the show in the film. It has to be said though that Gotz Otto and Udeo Kier are brilliant too and bring a wealth of experience to the acting talent on display.\n\nIt would be criminal to compare this to Hollywood blockbusters because that&apos;s simply not it was aimed to be - a future cult classic for sure, but definitely a film that will divide opinion. An original film - which in this day and age is something that you will rarely come across. Hilariously offensive, and at only an hour and a half it will leave you wanting more.\n\n8 out of 10.",

It&apos;s a fantasy of goodwill film that induces plenty of smiles and packs heart. Kevin James is perfect in the lead and his common man qualities play extremely well here. They lean on the Rocky formula a lot but that&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing. One thing is for sure, Salma Hayek is the hottest &quot;Adrian&quot; type love interest to ever play in this type of film. She&apos;s amazing throughout. A warm shout out to Henry Winkler who is also perfectly cast as the somewhat eccentric music teacher with the heart of gold.\n\nA wonderful surprise that I enjoyed very much."

      "reviewBody": "A social worker named Emily Jenkins (Renee Zellweger) fights to save a girl named Lilith Sullivan (Jodelle Ferland) from her abusive parents (Callum Keith Rennie , Kerry O&apos;Malley) . When Emily meet the nine-year-old girl, she immediately fall in love with the well-educated daughter and then she decides to adopt the child only to aware that the situation is more dangerous than she ever expected . Eventually, Emily begins to feel that Lilith is manipulative and possibly even psychologically disturbed . Later on , Emily learns Lilith has a troubled and mysterious history. Jenkins helped by Det. Mike Barron (Ian McShane) delves further into Lilith&apos;s past and discovers she is not at all who she pretends to be.\n\nThis is an entertaining terror movie where the intrigue,tension, suspense appear threatening and lurking in every room, corridors , elevator and interior and exterior. Remarkably well-acted, darkly paced , and effectively disturbing .This frightening movie is plenty of thrills, scary fun, chills, body-count and nice use of color with phenomenal results . It&apos;s brilliantly cast - Renee Zellwegger and Bradley Cooper- are top-notch as usual, but what really stood out where the natural performances director Christian Alvert (who subsequently would direct another good terror film with surprising style as ¨Pandorum) was able to get from the child actor-Ferland- .\n\nDark, edgy, twisted, effective, clever, intense, one of the best &quot;evil child&quot; films I&apos;ve ever seen along with ¨The orphan¨(2008) by Jaume Collet Serra .It is a well-acted and slow-building suspense story with slick direction and cinematography. The creepy score also serves the film well, without becoming overpowering in signaling this is an &quot; eerie&quot; film. The actress who plays Lilith shows a skill in performance that makes one think we may actually have another Jodie Foster to keep an eye on. Compelling directed with startling visual content by Christian Alvart (Pandorum , Antibodies , Curiosity: the cat) . This genuinely mysterious story is well made and is one of the best ¨evil kid¨ movie with effective aesthetic and sense of style . Rating : 6,5 acceptable ; this unsettling picture will appeal to Renee Zelleweger fans and horror genre buffs .",

      "reviewBody": "For those who have played the field and sown some wild oats around town, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past might be a walk down a personal memory lane into why nothing lasts longer than possibly that first, genuine relationship. There are reasons abound why some are either commitment freaks, or just plainly wanting to chalk up a list of conquests to show off, and for top fashion photographer Connor Meat, erm I mean Mead (Matthew McConaughey), it&apos;s a run from responsibility, and the fear of never ever wanting to be hurt again.\n\nI&apos;m pretty sure many who have gone through a break-up would admit to having it leave some bad aftertaste, that you&apos;d just want the upper hand the next time around when dealing with that painful, negative emotion, should and if it happens. Call it insurance, or the hardening of the heart, and if you&apos;re to subscribe to the tips shared in this film, it&apos;s preaching to love a little less if you&apos;re to walk away unscathed. This does not apply to those who are for the notion of true love, happiness and that institution called Marriage, and for a film whose protagonist celebrates and actually enjoys his freedom and singlehood, it ends with a cop-out smack in the face.\n\nThe trailer would have pretty much shown everything you need to know about the plot. For the ultimate swinger in Connor, nothing is worse than having to attend the wedding of his brother Paul (Breckin Meyer) as his best man, to toast during a ceremony he won&apos;t touch with a ten foot pole. Making it worse of course is the attendance of the only girl he has ever had genuine feelings for, his childhood and first girlfriend Jenny Perotti (Jennifer Garner). Then comes the whole shebang of A Christmas Carol proportions where Connor is visited by his dead uncle, Wayne (Michael Douglas), responsible for imparting his techniques to getting laid, who tells him that he&apos;ll be visited by three ghosts before the night is up. And for the home run, it&apos;s a determination if Connor would become a changed person and end up with the girl of his dreams (the future ghost did look hot though).\n\nThose expecting comedy, you&apos;ll be disappointed as the jokes come off rather half-baked, making fun of best mens as nerds and bridesmaids who are horny all the time. Then there&apos;s the future father-in-law in war veteran Sergeant Volkom (Robert Forster) and his ex-wife Vonda (Anne Archer) whom Connor tries to hit (no women too young or old it seems). Those in for romance, unfortunately both McConaughey and Garner exhibit no sparks nor chemistry, perhaps the latter being all settled already as a real mom, that she&apos;s miscast as the mid-30-something still out there looking for love, and holding a candle for her childhood friend.\n\nDirector Mark Waters would be an old hand at handling ghostly apparitions in a romantic comedy, after all he had dealt with Resse Whiterspoon and Mark Ruffalo in Just Like Heaven. But his only saving grace in this movie with little surprises, is that of Michael Douglas&apos; performance as the old-swinger Uncle Wayne, hamming it up as the adult version of Will Smith&apos;s Hitch, but with some pluses in not just wanting to establish that first hello, but going all the way for that one night stand, sharing some tips and tricks that you probably might just get lucky with. \n\nGhosts of Girlfriends Past turns out to be a misnomer, as Emma Stone gets to represent the countless of faceless, nameless women that Connor gets down with. As a date movie it&apos;s pretty formula, made worse by its taking a leaf from A Christmas Carol. The only element that kept me entertained, was the blast from the past moments complete with an excellent soundtrack to bring back those 80s and 90s nostalgia. See if you can spot the track 6 Underground by The Sneaker Pimps, and Time After Time by Cyndi Lauper, amongst others.",

To begin with, the plot line is brilliant showing the stories of several women and how they change emotionally and physically in some cases through the movie. These characters all have their own story arcs, their own personalities and their own ways of dealing with things which creates an interesting interaction when they run into each other. The actresses and actors that play some of the main characters are perfect, playing their roles to their full potential making them lovable and just downright hilarious. The film itself also has some interesting life lessons and things to live by throughout. The film is indeed funny and light hearted and I much recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh.",

Truthful and powerful even when he plays characters that are the opposite of truthful, the opposite of powerful that even don&apos;t seem to be there. &quot;Crazy Heart&quot; reminds us. He&apos;s one of the greatest American actors of his or any other generation. His face when he realizes he lost the little boy will haunt me forever.

      "reviewBody": "Nightmare on Elm Street 3 (1987) was the third film in the Freddy Krueger series.  This time around a hospital ward full of disturbed teenagers are the latest target for Freddy Krueger.  Thanks in large part because the kids can&apos;t stop dreaming about the world&apos;s most famous serial killer/ child molester turned supernatural monster.  Everyone should know by now that he likes to feed off the fear of the wee ones.  Now with more people to add to his collection,  Freddy decides to play ten little indians with the lot of them.  That is until his old nemesis Nancy comes back into town to help the kids fight him off and end the nightmare.  Will Nancy and the kids be able to defeat Freddy for good?  Find out because this one&apos;s too good to pass up. \n\nNot as complex as the last film but highly entertaining.  This is the film that has Freddy morphing into his one-liner spewing act that has made him insanely popular.  Fun stuff.\n\nHighly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "If you like Dane Cook then chances are you have seen his movies and while Good Luck Chuck is better and in some instances funnier, it still is just another Employee of the Month. I personally enjoy Dane Cook&apos;s humor and I thought Employee of the Month was....decent. I was hoping Good Luck Chuck would be a hilarious smash hit but throughout the advanced screening I kept thinking to myself &quot;Okay well this is funny but it&apos;s so typical.&quot; Now I don&apos;t want to give anything away but let&apos;s just say if you&apos;ve seen at least one romantic comedy in your life then you know the entire story of Good Luck Chuck already. \n\nDon&apos;t get me wrong, I laughed pretty much all the way through the movie although there were occasional points where it died down a little. Sad to say there were only a few really memorable funny parts to the movie though. Most was just slapstick style humor and revolting sex jokes. The humor in Good Luck Chuck was by far raunchier than Employee of the Month but then again that was PG-13 and this is R. \n\nI mentioned that the movie was typical and when I say typical I mean every romantic movie cliché possible was used. It was like they took a blueprint for a love story and then just added Dane Cook and Jessica Alba and then made them do funny things. Granted there are moments where they stray a little or add a funny twist to the formula but it definitely didn&apos;t take long to come up with the progression of love in the film.\n\nIf you want your next dose of laughter after Superbad then go see Good Luck Chuck but don&apos;t expect anything new or inventive in terms of storytelling. It is however something to note that there are tons of sex scenes, lots of boobs, extremely raunchy jokes, and Jessica Alba does not reveal any body parts although some side boob can be glanced for a brief moment in the movie. (Just an FYI for all those who were dying to know)",

No, its not fine art, its a summer comedy, and it delivers plenty of laughs. I am middle-aged guy whose not into early Adam Sandler, or Napoleon Dynamite type comedies, and this movie had me laughing hard. Sure, not at every single joke, but at most of them. If you are into absurdest humor, or enjoyed movies like Hot Fuzz, or Super Troopers, you&apos;ll find plenty to enjoy. P.S. My wife liked it too.",

The costumes and sets are dazzling, and the dances are great. The moves are seductive but not erotic, and I commend the choreographers for getting this fine balance right. Christina Aguilera has always been known for her powerful voice, and in &quot;Burlesque&quot; her voice and singing skills are brilliantly displayed.\n\nIn some films, the abundance of songs can make the film like an extended music video, or is awkward or forced. In &quot;Burlesque&quot; there is no such problem. The speaking scenes and singing scenes transit smoothly from one another. Another thing I really like about this film is the witty lines, they made me laugh so many times! I never thought &quot;Burlesque&quot; could be so good, I think it should have made a lot more in the box office."

This is a strong, well-conceived horror tale about a devout, but demented man in Thurman, Texas that goes on a murdering spree after getting orders from God to eliminate demons trying to control mankind. A couple of plot twists and an eerie finale makes for your moneys worth. Most of the violence you don&apos;t really see, but still enough to double up your stomach.\n\nDirector Paxton plays the twisted man to be known as the Hand of God Killer. Matthew McConaughey is equally impressive as the demented man&apos;s eldest son that ends up telling this story to a Dallas FBI Agent(Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and flawless.

His cynical review does not do the movie, its story or its message justice.\n\nThe acting is excellent, no doubt, but &quot;annoying&quot; is a comment from someone with his emotions firmly implanted where the sun does not shine, and communicates more about the reviewer than it does about the film.\n\nAlso, it is not a fault per se, that the ending of a film is predictable and I tire of this being used as negative criticism. The message is in the story, and a surprise ending is the last thing this charming story needs, or thankfully, has.\n\nOh, and since I used to be someone exactly like the Reeves character is the start of the movie, I can relate to what it is to discover that there is more to life. His character is real alright, but in the surreal sort of way that only those who have actually been there and escaped, truly understand. Now, if only I had had someone as charming as Ms. Theron to show me :-) \n\nAnyway, this is not an &quot;epic&quot; film or even a &quot;great&quot; film - its just a film with a story a few messages and some excellent performances that will tug on your emotions - not altogether a bad thing in a cynical age.",

      "reviewBody": "An emotional film (bring some hankies) exploring the love of children for their mother, the loss of a loved one, and the near-death experiences of the two main characters. The acting is superb, particularly the young McLaren brothers and Cecile DeFrance. I applaud Clint Eastwood for taking this risk and creating a solid piece with riveting emotions and a fantastic conclusion. The only leap of faith that must be taken is the belief that George (Matt Damon) truly has this gift/curse since it is the thread that weaves through all his relationships. This is truly an enjoyable movie and adds to my belief that the greatness of a film is not in the critic&apos;s eyes but in your own. This is the second sleeper movie of the week for me. The first one was RED...a great, entertaining movie.",

The film gives the fair nuances of it.\n\n\n\n* Lewis McDougall is great as Connor. And , just great.\n\n\n\n* It is a nice gift to discover the work of Sigourney Weaver and Felicity Jones. Or the short appearence of lovely Geraldine Chaplin.\n\n\n\n* It is a film to remind and to feel it . A sort of confirmation of truths deep inside you.\n\n\n\n* At the end, you know- it is a film about yourself . The connection with th family members, the selfishness, the so useful imaginary friend, the stories passing generation by generation.\n\n\nSo, more than a good film with spectacular special effects.

It had all the necessary features of a good movie: the cast was superb, the plot was superb, and in the case of thrillers, there was genuine &quot;thrills&quot; throughout.\n\nKeifer Sutherland offered a marvelous performance as the male lead in the piece, portraying a scientist who believes he can find the answers to life and death by killing himself and then coming back to life, essentially &quot;stealing&quot; death&apos;s secrets away. Kevin Bacon offers an excellent performance as the more morally decent counterpart to Keifer, while Julia Roberts offers her most convincing role. William Baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and, apparently, intercourse. And Oliver Platt, in another outstanding performance, portrays the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent.\n\nThe story is relatively simple, yet original, and the acting is refreshing-- definitely a stand out film for the genre, and one that has set the standard for measuring other thrillers for me.\n\n8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "NOTE: I&apos;ve skirted around some of the key thrilling episodes that occur within the film, but I feel I&apos;ve talked about them without actually giving anything away. I don&apos;t think this review requires a spoiler alert!\n\nI watched this having heard absolutely nothing about it, and having not even heard of it. I caught the picture of the cover art, and it seemed like it was Wilson and Brosnan, so thought I&apos;d take a look. \n\nRight from the off - it had the feel of something everso slightly different from the normal action film fodder. I won&apos;t ruin the surprise beginning, and then it cuts to the Wilson based family heading into this unnamed Asian country for a job-move. \n\nFrom almost upon arrival and for the rest of the film, it&apos;s something of a thrill ride. I found myself particularly enthralled when Bell was trapped in their hotel room at the beginning of events - something about the acting and the filming really conveyed real fear and this totally hooked me in. It was clear that this was going to be a decent film from this moment on. It has a slightly &quot;handicam&quot; film-making quality about it, but in this instance, it absolutely adds to the feel imho. \n\nFrom the hotel rooftop to the adjacent, again, it conveyed real fear. Would you do that with your family? Shocking from a parents point of view, but believable in that you&apos;d have no choice. From a parental perspective - totally shocking and enthralling. My wife happened to walk into the room just at this point, and she was definitely mentally scarred by what she saw! \n\nAnd there it goes on - for me, the only real slight let-downs in the movie are when Brosnan re-finds the family which in such a scenario really isn&apos;t likely to have happened, and indeed what Bell does whilst they are hiding in the old man&apos;s garden. I don&apos;t feel that a mother, protecting her children would have done that. \n\nApart from these small elements of storyline which probably allowed a little too much implausibility, along with just how much difficulty with the local rebels Wilson&apos;s character was realistically likely to overcome and deal with, particularly towards the end of the film - even with full adrenalin running were the only small faults. \n\nStill, having said all that - I&apos;ll be watching this again soon. It was quite a thrill ride and most certainly not wholesome family entertainment. There&apos;s some really quite surprisingly graphic scenes of violence, which totally suited the film, but definitely not for young eyes.",

      "reviewBody": "I just finished seeing this movie for the first time.  I&apos;ll begin by saying that it&apos;s been some time since a film got the reaction out of me this one did.  For the first 45 minutes, I was convinced this movie was intent on trying to be the most depressing story ever told.  For the next 45 minutes, I was still interested, but my overall opinion was hanging on the ending..of which I was very skeptical, as I knew what was left to be revealed.  Then, it was over.  Boy, they just don&apos;t make enough of &apos;em that good, folks.\n\nWhen you see a movie for the first time after it&apos;s already won mad Oscars, you end up judging performances based on that.  Most times, it doesn&apos;t help their cause.  Kim Basinger in LA Confidential (another movie I love) springs to mind.  Up to the last 10 minutes of this movie, my opinion was that Halle had done a real nice job...it was an interesting character, and she certainly hadn&apos;t done anything to screw it up.  Then, came that moment on the back steps...and that look...and that immediate realization that sometimes we&apos;re just along for the damn ride, and there ain&apos;t a whole lot anybody can do about it but try and hang on and not get run over.  That five seconds defines this movie...if it doesn&apos;t work, the whole thing crashes. I applaud her craft--she totally nailed it.\n\nThis is definitely Billy Bob&apos;s best performance since Sling Blade...a movie so good, it almost becomes cliche in your memory.  There are times here when he carries himself with a beaten-down grace that is just brilliantly complex.  Who knows where this character would end up in the hands of another actor, but I can&apos;t think of one that would have left me feeling the same way.\n\nFor those of you who don&apos;t get this movie--be it for the lack of attention to certain strings of logic in what appears to be a real small town; or for its refusal to spell out for you what somebody may be thinking from moment to moment, let alone from day to day...well, I&apos;m sure the next Matrix is gonna be real good, too.  I&apos;m just glad that there are still folks out there making movies that can totally exist on a back porch with a pint of ice cream.\n\nI give this film a 9."

The short story was a relatively simple morality tale. Usually I am not one to compare source material with movies. They are totally separate animals and frequently the movie version is a big improvement on the original material.\n\nIn this case, the two cannot even be compared - even the plot is barely recognizable in the movie version. That would be fine if the movie plot were an improvement. Instead we have a mush mash of hints, bloody noses and awkward special effects.\n\nI guess it is still a morality tale, but an overly complicated one. The performers do the best they can.",

Yes, the premise is familiar, the plot is formulaic, the characters seem like you&apos;ve met them before. \n\nBut...\n\n&quot;The devil is in the details,&quot; as they say, and this picture has just enough surprises, just enough charm, just enough fine acting to make it worth watching. Movies do not have to be real to be worthwhile, they just have to be about real things. The questions &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; covers are still very much with us, and may provoke considerable discussion in your house. This film is respectful enough of its subject matter and well-enough executed to make it a much better way to spend your time than most of what&apos;s out there now.

      "reviewBody": "This movie unfolds slowly &amp; tentatively, but picks up speed as it progresses...or maybe I was just too concerned with Steve Martin&apos;s interpretation of Inspector Clouseau, and I finally relaxed about halfway through the film. Well, when you&apos;re used to seeing Peter Sellers as Clouseau, it&apos;s just difficult to view anyone else in that role. But, true to the character, Steve Martin does make it his own, and actually pulls it off pretty effectively. He has always been good with physical humor, and this film is no exception.\n\nSimilarly, its difficult to adjust to seeing Kevin Kline as Inspector Dreyfus. Since this movie is a prequel, I can assume that Clouseau has yet to get completely under his skin. It was typical Kevin Kline ... dry, with a weak french accent. I was mildly disappointed because I really enjoyed his french character &amp; accent in French Kiss several years ago.\n\nThe first few gags were very short-sided and fell flat, but once Clouseau starts looking for clues the slapstick works a little better &amp; the film gets more enjoyable. Many of the gags are predictable (as is the plot), but what really makes them work is Martin&apos;s reactions (which I really think was the key to Peter Seller&apos;s portrayal as well).\n\nThis film was very tame, with only subtle innuendoes that most youngsters aren&apos;t likely to grasp. The audience appeared to laugh at least as much as I did. If you don&apos;t expect too much, this movie will be fun; if you expect too much, you&apos;re likely to be disappointed.",

So, they have to cut $ from production &amp; the end result is very bright color saturation, cheap sets &amp; even cheaper cgi effects. The movie reminded me of a beloved 80&apos;s movie of mine, Return Of the Living Dead. It&apos;s equal comedy &amp; camp as it is horror &amp; gore. Jamie &amp; Dave do what they do best.

It was fun to see Christopher Lloyd pop up in a film again. We also got see some good performances from Kenan Thompson and Ann-Margret. Look, with this movie, there are no revolutionary jokes. It&apos;s everything you would expect there to be. I do tend to prefer edgier comedy than this, but I made my peace with it the second the first joke hit. This isn&apos;t meant to be a Seth Rogen kind of comedy. This is supposed to just be a fun, light- hearted, feel-good comedy, and it was really good for what it was...",

I couldn&apos;t quite get past the pain and heaviness of the film... and at second screening, I really got to enjoy the (biutiful) visual metaphors that the director wanted to paint for us. It is indeed grim... and human. Like life, and perhaps a reflection of these days, not everything ends up happily ever after... we all are surviving each day in our own ways. This slice of family life, in a small quarter of Barcelona, is not glossed over and prettied up like most Hollywood films that we&apos;ve slowly grown to despise (I know I don&apos;t speak for everyone). This is not the film that you go to to escape from reality... it&apos;s reality facing right back at you. It paints a perspective on the lives of those living on the frayed edges of our society, in every part of the world. For me, I think it is a pity that none of the Big Six picked it up for wider distribution. And that&apos;s the sad note for today&apos;s American cinema.",

Is it for the Indian audience - the upper strata, the commoners, the hoi polloi? Or is it targetted at the international audience?\n\nSadak 2 is neither novel nor experimental. It falls flat on its face! While bits and pieces of the first half are somewhat watchable, the film goes completely awry in its post-interval portions. A disaster of epic proportion! Seriously, what was Mahesh Bhatt and Suhrita Sengupta thinking while penning this apology of a script? Strangely, director Mahesh Bhatt&apos;s style is abstract this time around, which fails to catch the viewer&apos;s fancy. He seems completely clueless.\n\nTo sum up, there are good films and there are bad films. Sadak 2 is neither good nor bad. It&apos;s just excruciatingly boring! In addition, there are too many coincidences all through, which totally seem unreal and unbelievable. Sadak 2 is over two hours of complete drivel.",

But all in all, a very entertaining film and an excellent use of a familiar theme-plot.\n\nIt should also be noted that Novella Nelson, who portrays Ambassador Alice Wills, is a noted songtress in her own right.  I have had the pleasure of attending a few of her concerts and night club appearances in the 1970s.  An excellent, sultry and sometimes fiery singer of jazz standards and R&amp;B."

      "reviewBody": "There is no one quite like Takashi Miike. His films drag you kicking and screaming into the bowels of the subconscious, wading through the darkest recesses of the mind to a place where sanity fears to tread. Unsettlingly unique, with a twisted sense of humour that often feels like it&apos;s laughing in your face, Miike&apos;s vision is as disturbing as it is unforgettable. Over the years, his films- from &apos;Visitor Q&apos; and &apos;Gozu&apos; to &apos;As the Gods Will&apos;- have defied genre conventions, electrifying audiences with their marvellous madness.\n\nMiike&apos;s penchant for defying expectation reaches its peak with &apos;Audition,&apos; a film that lulls you into a false sense of comfort before pulling the rug out from under you. What begins as a seemingly innocent tale of romance and second chances morphs into a terrifying exploration of obsession, manipulation and the dark side of human desire. Here Miike&apos;s mastery of suspense and psychological horror truly comes to the fore, leaving one both mesmerized and petrified.\n\nBased on a Ryû Murakami novel, and with a screenplay by Daisuke Tengan, it follows Shigeharu Aoyama, a widower whose friend suggests a peculiar way to help him find a new wife: by holding auditions for a role in a fictional television series. The women who try out are unaware of the true purpose behind the casting call. Shigeharu eventually chooses the soft-spoken Asami Yamazaki, setting in motion a twisted game of deception and violence that will inevitably lead to disaster.\n\nAt its core, the film is a masterclass on how to slowly unravel a narrative, building tension and suspense without relying on conventional horror tropes. Miike takes his time, establishing Shigeharu&apos;s loneliness and sincere longing for companionship. The film lures the audience into a false sense of security, mirroring Shigeharu&apos;s delusions around his search for love. While hiding the darker reality beneath the surface as the story progresses, the sense of dread becomes palpable, shifting from subtle unease to outright terror.\n\n&apos;Audition&apos; also explores the complex themes of desire, control and the power dynamics at play in relationships, especially those rooted in objectification and manipulation. Shigeharu&apos;s superficial approach to finding a partner- viewing his auditionee wives as interchangeable- serves as a critique of the commodification of intimacy. Asami, on the other hand, embodies a darker form of agency, using her past trauma and quiet demeanour to manipulate, ultimately controlling the narrative. Their twisted dance of dominance and submission drives the film towards its nightmarish climax.\n\nOn a deeper level, the film also functions as a profound meditation on the complex psychological dynamics between its central characters. Shigeharu, driven by grief and loneliness, initially approaches his search for a wife with the same detached objectivity as a casting director. His blind desire for companionship renders him complicit in the very horrors he unknowingly sets in motion.\n\nAsami, in contrast, exemplifies a darker form of agency. Having internalized her trauma, she uses it as a means of control. Her silence and reserve are deceptive, masking a raging inner world. She is all too ready to manipulate Shigeharu, ultimately shaping their shared fate. The film suggests that the consequences of human desire are not just about the object of that desire but the desperate lengths one may go to, to satisfy it.\n\nMiike also taps into the cultural undercurrent of late 1990&apos;s Japan, where traditional views on marriage and the commodification of women were being questioned in the face of modernization. This social context adds an extra layer of critique, positioning Shigeharu&apos;s objectification of the women he auditions as a reflection of broader societal attitudes toward relationships, intimacy and gender roles. The film&apos;s eerie depiction of marriage as a transaction- rather than a partnership based on mutual respect- resonates with these cultural critiques, making &apos;Audition&apos; a chilling commentary on the commodification of love itself.\n\nThe film&apos;s atmosphere is one of its most potent weapons. Miike expertly shifts from serene, almost ordinary moments to escalating chaos, often without warning. The tension between the mundanity of Shigeharu&apos;s life- his attempts to fill the void left by his wife and the horrific events brewing beneath the surface- keeps the audience constantly on edge. The film&apos;s deliberate pace allows dread to build as we slowly uncover the dark realities of both Shigeharu&apos;s search for companionship and Asami&apos;s tortured past. This slow burn makes the eventual explosion of violence all the more shocking and impactful.\n\nAlongside cinematographer Hideo Yamamoto, Miike&apos;s use of sound and visual style is crucial in creating the film&apos;s suffocating atmosphere. The muted colours and empty spaces of the early scenes are contrasted by the sudden, jarring violence that erupts later, making each disturbing moment all the more visceral. Moreover, Kôji Endô&apos;s haunting, unsettling score and the quiet, eerie silences contribute to a pervasive feeling of unease. Miike&apos;s decision to focus on small, often uncomfortable details- a close-up of a hand, a long, lingering shot of a man in a wheelchair- forces one to become complicit in the horror, deepening the nightmare.\n\nRyo Ishibashi stars as Shigeharu, opposite Eihi Shiina&apos;s Asami. Ishibashi gives a nuanced performance, subtly embodying the character&apos;s growing desperation and vulnerability. His portrayal of a man who, while seeking genuine companionship, remains oblivious to the dark forces at play, draws one in, making his eventual fate all the more chilling. Ishibashi&apos;s ability to shift from a seemingly benign, fatherly figure to a man trapped in his own naïve desires heightens the emotional stakes of the film.\n\nShiina, meanwhile, delivers a hauntingly quiet, yet intensely unsettling performance. With minimal dialogue, she conveys a wealth of emotion through her eyes and body language, imbuing Asami with an air of mystery and quiet menace. Her transformation from a seemingly delicate, almost fragile woman to a vengeful force of nature is chilling. Shiina&apos;s performance is key to the film&apos;s eerie atmosphere, capturing the tension simmering beneath the surface until it erupts into full-blown terror. In addition, the supporting cast do routinely strong work, notably Jun Kunimura and Renji Ishibashi as Shigeharu&apos;s friend and a wheel-chair bound creep, respectfully.\n\nComparing it to other psychological thrillers of its time, such as David Fincher&apos;s &apos;Seven&apos;, Miike&apos;s film stands out for its unflinching commitment to horror transcending mere shock value. Unlike other films relying on conventional narrative arcs, &apos;Audition&apos; takes its time unravelling the tension, making its violent payoff all the more harrowing. It remains one of the most unique, unnerving psychological thrillers of its era, cementing Miike&apos;s legacy as a director who not only defies genre conventions but also reshapes them, with a pickaxe to the head.\n\nIn conclusion, Takashi Miike&apos;s &apos;Audition&apos; is a masterpiece of the macabre. Well-written and strikingly shot, it draws you into a nightmare where escape seems impossible. Hard to forget, the performances- especially Eihi Shiina&apos;s as Asami- are remarkable. Miike doesn&apos;t just push the boundaries of horror; he shatters them, leaving behind a film that is as unforgettable as it is unsettling. &apos;Audition&apos; stands as a testament to his unrelenting creativity, proving that horror can be both terrifying and thought-provoking- an experience that lingers long after the credits roll.",

      "reviewBody": "In this age of super-broad comedies and sexed-up teen films, there comes Nick and Norah&apos;s Infinite Playlist. It&apos;s all-too-easy to groan at the thought of sitting down to a high school film these days, yet &apos;Nick &amp; Norah&apos; attempts to make you rethink that. It tries to achieve that so rare of an achievement; it tries to make a genuine and honest teen comedy.\n\nIt succeeds.\n\nMichael Cera, that king of adorable dorkiness, stars as Nick, the sole straight member of a queer-rock band. Kat Dennings plays Norah, a rocking rich chick who is just as unattracted to teenage pettiness as the rest of us are. These two meet through a random encounter and together set out to try and find the secret show of the aptly titled rock band Where&apos;s Fluffy? They cruise the town like grown adults, yet underneath both are incredibly naive. They argue, fight, flirt, and, yes, fall in love; what makes the film great is how mature and honest a relationship they create. We know from the beginning that it is the destiny of Nick and Norah to get together, yet when they do it is nothing short of soulful. With a wonderfully witty script along for the ride, it&apos;s apparent that this is much more than your average teenage comedy. 7/10 stars! \n\nJay Addison",

Enhanced by some creative photography, the violence is brutal and visceral. Taking its time, the film asks the audience to be patient for the hero to fully come into his &quot;powers,&quot; but the payoff is well worth it. There is some &quot;shaky cam,&quot; but not too much to ruin the experience. The spirituality, as well as the legends told in the movie, really add to the overall story, giving the film more substance than a lot of action films. The villains could of been developed a bit more, especially the Lion, but that&apos;s nitpicking.",

      "reviewBody": "BEGINNERS is not an easy film. It&apos;s very &apos;talky&apos; and jumps almost randomly between Oliver&apos;s boyhood, Hal&apos;s coming out and getting sick, and Oliver&apos;s on-off affair with zany Anna. Although set in sunny California, there are many under-lit scenes reminiscent of French New Wave cinema or early Woody Allens. Key episodes are, almost perversely, missing. Hal is largely absent from Oliver&apos;s mother-dominated boyhood; he later admits to having sex in mens-rooms but we don&apos;t see any of that. We see his decline and death but not his wife&apos;s. We are not shown any of Oliver&apos;s life between boyhood and his father&apos;s &apos;liberation&apos;.\n\nThe performances are nothing less than brilliant. Christopher Plummer, plunging into gay life in his seventies and dying with curmudgeonly dignity, will very likely be nominated for an Oscar and miss out (like Colin Firth going down the gay road in A SINGLE MAN). Ewan McGregor gets perfectly under the skin of Oliver, who finds it easier to love his gay dad than commit to a new girlfriend. And Melanie Laurent&apos;s Anna is beguiling and disturbing; the viewer to feel what Oliver feels: you want to love her but something holds you back.\n\nThere is also a scene-stealing Jack Russell, Arthur, the love of Hal&apos;s life who becomes the love of Oliver&apos;s. A talking dog! – that is to say, writer/director Mike Mills gives Arthur subtitled thoughts every now and again. Kind of weird and kind of wonderful – kind of like the movie."

      "name": "A worthy new version of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; with marvelous visuals and excellent performances",
      "reviewBody": "Charlotte Brontë&apos;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; has been my favorite book since I was 11 years old. The tale of a feisty orphan-girl-turned-governess who finds true love in a spooky mansion and ultimately redeems a tormented hero has made it to the top of every &quot;Best Love Stories&quot; list since it was first published in 1847, and with good reason. It&apos;s the perfect Gothic novel, melding mystery, horror, and the classic medieval castle setting with heart-stopping romance. \n\nThere have been at least 18 film versions of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and 9 made-for-television movies--27 in all! I have seen most of them, some multiple times–-both out of my deep love for the tale, and as part of the research for my novel &quot;The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë,&quot; the true story of Charlotte&apos;s remarkable life, her inspiration behind &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; and her turbulent, real-life romance.\n\nEvery screen version of JANE EYRE has its merits. I especially loved Timothy Dalton&apos;s portrayal of Mr. Rochester in the 1983 mini-series, and the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre mini-series starring Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens. I was very curious to see how the new JANE EYRE adaptation from Focus Films would measure up. I am happy to report that the film, which I saw last night at an advance screening, is very good indeed, with marvelous visuals, terrific performances, and enough unique elements to make it a worthy new addition.\n\nThe most notable distinction that sets this film apart from the rest is its structure. Rather than telling the tale in a linear fashion, it begins at a crisis moment later in the story, and tells the majority of the tale in flashback–-which works wonderfully well, enabling screenwriter Moira Buffini to effectively compress a long novel into a two-hour time span.\n\nThe movie opens as Jane is fleeing Thornfield after having discovered Mr. Rochester&apos;s dark and heartbreaking secret. We fear for her as she becomes lost on the stormy moor. The mystery continues as St. John Rivers (well-played by a sympathetic yet appropriately stern Jamie Bell) and his sisters take her in. As Jane ruminates about the past events that led to her escape, we are treated to the story in flashback.\n\nThe casting of Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre also sets this production apart, since she is closer in age than most actresses who&apos;ve played the role to the character in the novel, who was about 18 years old in the Thornfield section. Although I wish Mia&apos;s Jane was a bit more &quot;swoony&quot; over Mr. Rochester earlier on (yes, she is supposed to be stoic, but I missed that phase where we get to see her blossom as she falls in love with him, and then is utterly crushed when she believes him to be in love with Miss Ingram), Mia truly inhabits the role, beautifully portraying Jane&apos;s sense of self-respect, integrity, and restraint, as well as her passion and vulnerability.\n\nMichael Fassbender embodies Mr. Rochester with the ideal blend of charisma and sinister brooding, while at the same time allowing glimpses of his underlying desperation and the wounded depths of his soul. Sally Hawkins as Mrs. Reed effectively portrays the icy ogre who menaces the young Jane (a spirited and appealing Amelia Clarkson.) And Judi Dench, as always, gives a superb performance as housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax.\n\nThe film&apos;s locations do justice to the novel&apos;s often gloomy, atmospheric tone. Director Cary Fukunaga makes excellent use of Haddon Hall in Derbyshire, one of the oldest houses in England, as Thornfield Hall, emphasizing its dark, Gothic, masculine feel. The exterior locations--gardens, cliffs, craggy rocks, stone walls, and seemingly endless fields--make an arresting, dramatic backdrop for the story. You truly feel as though you are in the middle of nowhere.\n\nMy only minor gripes are that when Mr. Rochester&apos;s secret is revealed, it feels a little too prettified, and the ending was too abrupt for me. But that aside, the filmmakers have done a masterful job translating the novel to the screen. I highly recommend it! --Syrie James",

A car thief is corrected into infiltrating The Organisation and reporting back.\n\nThis is an incredibly powerful story, a fascinating point in America&apos;s history. This film is not afraid to show the violence, racism and prejudice that was very real. It doesn&apos;t shy away from showing the brutality, the misery faced by people of colour.\n\nUncomfortable at times, but it&apos;s a gripping watch, this film will hold your attention throughout, it&apos;s one of those that passes by, without you questioning the running time.\n\nShaka King&apos;s direction is spot on, this film moves by at a real pace. The cinematography and music are phenomenal, especially the latter.\n\nDaniel Kaluuya, he&apos;s one of those people I&apos;m convinced will one day own a string of Oscars, an awe inspiring actor, and naturally he does it again here with a spellbinding performance. Huge credit also to LaKeith Stanfield, marvellous also.\n\nI figure this film may not be to everyone&apos;s taste, but I&apos;d certainly recommend it, it really does tell a powerful story. It&apos;s inspired me to do a little research and reading of my own.\n\n9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I was pleasantly surprised when I saw a trailer for this movie a while back. I always enjoyed the show when I caught it on TV, except when it got really stupid towards the end (Mulder dies, then is buried in a coffin and is then dug up again and is alive--Excuse me?). Given that, I was happy to catch up with Scully and Mulder. It had been six years. Six years. Six years for the shows creators to come up with a script worthy of the legacy of the show. NOT! What a piece of doo-doo. This wouldn&apos;t have cut it as a two part episode during season eight. What were they thinking? That show had some of the best writing and directing in the history of television. Part of the joy of watching that show was that it was so much like a movie. Every week you got to watch an incredibly engrossing mini-movie. I felt bad for the actors. They looked slightly embarrassed to be there. Imagine having read the script, knowing it was a dog, and then having to do it and not be able to tell the writer, &quot;You know, Chris, this really sucks...&quot; because he&apos;s the big honcho and gave you your big break seventeen years ago. This is supposed to be a movie. Movies are supposed to be BIG. This seemed chintzy. It felt like a rip-off. Six years! If they weren&apos;t going to do it right, why did they do it at all? During the movie, my friend, who is not really a big fan of X-Files, leaned over and said, &quot;This is like a remake of &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot; with an actual budget...&quot; Sadly, I had to agree."

      "name": "Black and Def are excellent, but the rest of the film is just disappointing",
      "reviewBody": "Just reading a brief synopsis got me fairly hyped for Be Kind Rewind. The film was written and directed by Michel Gondry, who directed my favourite movie in the last five years, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so it was a no-brainer that this would be a movie I would want to see. But unfortunately, the idea seemed to be a whole lot better than the final product.\n\nMike (Mos Def) works at an aging video rental story in New Jersey run by Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover). Despite the advent of DVD, the store only carries VHS tapes, and rents them to local customers at a fee far cheaper than the usual rental store. The store is apparently a landmark, so Mr. Fletcher does not want to give into local developers looking to turn the block into a nice piece of real estate. He leaves Mike in charge for a few days, but leaves specific instructions for him to not his friend Jerry (Jack Black) into the store. He does, and after a rather amusing accident, Jerry manages to erase all of the tapes in the store. To help cover this up, Mike and Jerry begin to film their own versions of the films.\n\nIt sounds creative on paper, but Be Kind Rewind is too muddled in subplots to really take advantage of its outrageous idea. The entire landmark dispute becomes rather boring and annoying right after it is mentioned, and the frequent mention of jazz musician Fats Waller loses its sentimental and nostalgic touch far too early on in the film. It just lacks the focus of Eternal Sunshine, and lacks the daring scope of The Science of Sleep, another film by Gondry. While Sleep was not all that great either, it seems to have had a much better grip on the point of the movie than Rewind does. It mopes around far too much, and I found myself more bored than I ever thought I would be watching it. I wanted to be interested, but the film did not make for many interesting moments. It has a sense of purpose and clearly knows what it wants to accomplish, but allowing it to seems to be an issue the film can never overcome.\n\nOne of these reasons may be the lack of depth in the characters. We learn very little about Mike or Jerry, and their pasts and motivations seem to never come up. We just know the basics, and that seems to be enough. Ditto for Mr. Fletcher, the frequent customer Miss Falewicz (Mia Farrow) and Alma (Melonie Diaz), who seems to get thrown into the mix rather randomly half way through the film, and never seems to fully materialize as anything other than being a female in a primarily male dominated main cast. Gondry clearly has a point for these characters to be here interacting (and a couple of curious supporting characters like Irv Gooch&apos;s Wilson, who lend the film a lot of its laughs), but he does not seem to want to make them be anything more than near one-dimensional cut-outs. I do not want to make them seem as simplistic as that, but more often than not, I really found myself not seeing anything other than that.\n\nWhen the film actually gets to its key drawing point, the re-filming of the VHS movies (or sweding as the film refers to it as), it does bring in a lot of that creative depth Gondry is known for. Using many different angles and stylistic devices, Gondry remakes specific scenes out of these movies with ease, and brings a lot of humour to them as well. Watching Def and Black redo Ghostbusters is absolutely hysterical, as is their redoing of Driving Miss Daisy, King Kong, We Were Kings and 2001: A Space Odyssey. But unfortunately, these scenes are really short and sweet, and many of them are never lingered on. Frequently, they are only mere seconds long before the next sweded movie scene comes in. At one point, there is just a scrolling list of movies that are being redone, but barely any are shown on screen. It is a little disappointing, but I did really like the footage that is shown.\n\nWhile the film&apos;s storyline is a little winded, and the character development is a little off, the actors themselves do really well.\n\nDef continues to impress, and helps carry this film from beginning to end. I am never really impressed with his work, but he seems to have a knack for making his characters enjoyable and very human in their design. He just seems to have that natural acting talent that every young actor tries to have, but never can truly create for themselves. Even in its most boring sections, Def delivers a great performance that is insightful and more introspective of what the film could have been had Gondry put more effort into it.\n\nThe same goes for Black, who continues to redefine himself as an actor. On one hand, he does his usual screwball schtick to its finest degree, and gets plenty of laughs for it. But on the other, he really develops his dramatic side, one that is seen only in the likes of King Kong (where his performance is not nearly as well liked as I think it is) and pretentious fare like Margot at the Wedding (which I doubt many people will ever attempt to see). It is a fine balance, and Black walks it perfectly throughout the film, and gives a solid performance for one of the film&apos;s most undefined characters. Kudos to him for really making something of it.\n\nWhile the rest of the supporting cast does fairly well for themselves, none ever match the charisma or the chemistry that Def and Black share. And in a film that is disappointing already, that makes it all the more worse.\n\n7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "WE OWN THE NIGHT is the quote from the lower portion of the badge on the uniforms of NYPD police family Deputy Chief Bert Grusinsky (Robert Duvall) and one of his two sons Capt. Joe Grusinsky (Mark Wahlberg): the other son Bobby (Joaquin Phoenix) did not follow the family tradition of police work but instead is involved in nightclubs - and yes there is a schism of resentment. Bobby has distanced himself further from his family by changing his last name to &apos;Green&apos;, living with a Puerto Rican girl Amada (Eva Mendes), and bonding to a wealthy Russian family who owns the nightclub where Bobby works - a front for a drug dealing business. Writer/Director James Gray (&apos;The Yards&apos; and &apos;Little Odessa&apos;) has a feel for this underbelly of New York City and captures the 1988 mood of life in the city and beneath the city with style. The problem with the story is that it has been done so many times that it is simply stale yesterday&apos;s lunch. Two brothers at opposite end of the family spectrum require a major tragedy to bring them together, and to offer any more information to this fairly thin plot would be a disservice to those who plan to see the film.\n\nThe cast is strong, partly because each of them has played similar roles countless times and have the ideas down pat. It should be noted that two of the producers of the film are Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix, probably a reason the film was made... There are some exciting moments and enough surprises and tense times to keep the adrenaline rolling, the smaller roles are very well cast, and one of the shining attributes of the film is the gorgeous Russian liturgy inspired musical score by Wojciech Kilar. It is not a bad film; it is just too much in the same mold as countless other New York police dramas. Grady Harp",

In many of their films they are serviceable, playing versions of themselves. It&apos;s the &quot;I&apos;m cool&quot; snappy patter, and suave, debonair style that infused the Oceans films (but definitely not 8). That&apos;s this movie.\n\nIt&apos;s also a loosely structured remake of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid, right down to the last scene.\n\nThe set pieces (chases, gun battles) go on too long.\n\nToo much of a good thing it&apos;s definitely too much here.\n\nThere are also many plot devices you have to swallow to allow the story to move forward. Not good.\n\nThe comedy shtick of two fixers/mechanics/cleaners who are not only carbon copies of each other, but also working for the same guy, gets a little thin. So does the odd sentimentality with the nerdy bagman that the two killers get caught up with. It started to remind me of The Fall Guy. Good actors in a just &quot;okay&quot; film. But that&apos;s fine, I guess.\n\nHowever, the bromance and easy coexistence these two actors have isn&apos;t hard to watch, but I wish there had been more revelatory scenes as to their background and training.\n\nBut...I&apos;m not sorry I watched it.",

      "name": "Great characters, simply a good comedy with a waterproof plot",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Get Shorty&quot; is a celebration of that usual Barry Sonnenfeld style of film making. Great characters, done by a great cast including John Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo, Danny DeVito, Dennis Farina, Delroy Lindo and.. Well the list just goes on and on. A perfect mix-up of that so called &quot;character-comedy&quot;, a movie progressing and dependant on the characters, making it hilarious comedy chaos.\n\nThe best thing about this film is obviously the whole cast, John Travolta as the smooth bad ass Chili Palmer, Gene Hackman as the hectic Harry Zimm. A bit unusual role from Hackman, which also makes the character so hilariously surreal. Rene Russo as &quot;the girl&quot; Karen Flores, Danny DeVito as the movie star Martin Weir with a huge ego, Dennis Farina as the loud mouth usual himself Ray &apos;Bones&apos; Barboni. Delroy Lindo as the tough Bo Catlett and James Gandolfini as Bo&apos;s bodyguard, failed stuntman Bear. Everyone just simply click together, which makes the movie even better than it actually is. It&apos;s just all about the characters. Chili Palmer must be one of the coolest characters ever seen on the big screen.\n\nLike mentioned before, Barry Sonnenfeld is the director of the movie and I honestly can&apos;t imagine anyone else directing a movie with a screenplay like this except Steven Soderbergh, the director of for example both &quot;Ocean&apos;s Eleven&quot; and &quot;Ocean&apos;s Twelve&quot;. I think that Sonnenfeld&apos;s and Soderbergh&apos;s styles connect together, they are very similar. And if they&apos;d do a British version of the movie, the director would be Guy Ritchie without a doubt. If you recognised both Soderbergh and Ritchie, then you know the style I&apos;m talking about and if you like both of their movies you should see &quot;Get Shorty&quot;. The other thing similar between these three directors besides the directing is the music used in their films. It&apos;s that usual horns and trumpets, giving that funky and exciting feeling for the film. It just fits for movies like these, creating that what is needed for the style. It also connects with the cinematography as well; Sudden movements of the angles, sudden stops, shots really close of the faces in these specific angles and when you add the music to that it&apos;s voilá.\n\n&quot;Get Shorty&quot; is all in all a great comedy with a plot that doesn&apos;t go over the silliness level. Sometimes movies like these go over that level, which usually make them funnier but also makes the whole story so unbelievable that it just isn&apos;t enjoyable as a movie anymore. Well the movie itself isn&apos;t THAT serious, it&apos;s a comedy after all, but it&apos;s definitely some quality entertainment. It includes a nice storyline, great characters and directing that just doesn&apos;t let you down. I recommend this movie to everyone once again. It&apos;s not amazing or phenomenal, it&apos;s a nice piece of entertainment, keeping you glued to your sofa throughout. What more can you ask for a boring Friday evening?",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;A Getty is special. A Getty is nobody&apos;s friend.&quot; J. Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer)\n\nIf Ridley Scott&apos;s All the Money in the World does anything well, it shows the banality of crime and wealth, at least as this abduction/ransom motif plays out. It&apos;s the story inspired by the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer) in 1973, his grandfather&apos;s resistance to paying the Italian Red Brigade&apos;s ransom demand, and the heroic effort of his mother, Gail Harris (Michelle Williams), to bring her son back alive.\n\nAfter slogging through the tepid back story (disjointed to say the least), the story gains strength through the passions of its leading players, both of whom have strong feelings about the right way to respond to the kidnappers&apos; demand for $17 million ransom. Mom would pay, considering grandpa is the richest man who ever lived, and he does not in principle want to capitulate. \n\nYet he may also have reasons to deny the ransom, one that paying would open floodgates of abductions for his other grandchildren and a point made later on but nonetheless fascinating history about the nature of the Getty fortune. Regardless, the central conflict of the story is not the kidnapping but the struggle between patriarch and daughter-in-law for the soul of the family and the deliverance of III.\n\nAlthough the cross editing between home and kidnappers is sometimes jarring, the director makes the audience feel as if it&apos;s present at the contentious proceedings. Trying to understand why the old man resists the ransom is a most difficult situation for parents who couldn&apos;t possibly do anything other than pay, but the audience can witness the arguments as if right there among the players.\n\nColdness pervades this film, as if Scott were able to let the audience feel the lack of warmth from the old man&apos;s. Several scenes show him in front of large fireplaces, evoking a Citizen Kane ambience. Getty echoes the self-centered, aloof, lonely Charles Foster Kane.\n\nFor the history and the acting, All the Money in the World is worth enjoying this season. Williams plays a resolute and resourceful mother and Plummer infuses the Scrooge-like Getty with a humanity that feels like we are with the real tycoon.\n\nThe film is also a cautionary tale about the corruption of wealth and the tenuous familial relations when money is the major player. See it and be happy with your small fortune, which may be, I hope, your loved ones."

For every little girl who ever dreamed of becoming a princess, this film is the perfect way to spend two hours.\n\nTrue, it was grossly unfaithful to Meg Cabot&apos;s original novels, but still managed to convey the charm and slick veneer that has come to be associated with Disney, and the valuable message of independence for little princesses everywhere.\n\nFor the more mature audience, this is a happy chance to revisit childhood, or simply breathe a sigh of relief that what your child is watching is not in any way compromising or damaging, and will not have to be explained later.\n\nGood message. Solid performances. Sweet (if bland and predictable at times) story line. Great movie!\n\nHighly recommended for two hours of escapism on a summer&apos;s afternoon."

      "name": "A wonderful and truly moving experience",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;My Girl&quot; is one of those small treasures that, on outward appearance, seems like something it is not.  Any general synopsis of the film would lead most people (including myself) to excuse the film as a dine-a-dozen coming-of-age drama with first kisses, raging hormones, and middle school bullies.\n\n\tThe truth is, &quot;My Girl&quot; has all of those elements (except for the latter; the film takes place during summertime).  It isn&apos;t the most original story, and it doesn&apos;t try to be a masterpiece.  Its goal is to entertain the younger viewer and to remind the older viewer of the nostalgic days of innocence and the heartbreaking first encounters with the loss of it.\n\n\tSummer, 1972.  Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky) is a plucky 11-year-old who spends her summer days with her best pal, Thomas J. (Macaulay Culkin, who is far better here than anything else he&apos;s ever done).  She dotes on her father, Harry (Dan Aykroid), who works as an in-house mortician. Subsequently, the Sultenfuss house (a grand old Victorian, naturally) is filled with the stench of death, made only worse by Vada&apos;s grandmother (Ann Nelson) whose only way of communicating is through her sporadic breaks into popular songs from the 1940s.  It&apos;s only natural that Vada is also a hypochondriac who often believes she is dying.\n\n\tThis is, of course, the summer that Vada grows up.  Signs of change first begin when a new woman shows up.  Her name is Shelly De Voto (Jamie Lee Curtis), and she works as a makeup artist for the dead bodies.  At first she is discouraged by the fact that her clientele are deceased, but when sees that Harry and Vada need an outlet, she gladly takes the job (`They&apos;re dead. All they have are their looks,&apos; she cheerfully gleams.)  Vada likes Shelly, but when she sees that Harry has developed a crush on her, she feels threatened.  She does not want Shelley to take the place of her late mother, who died two days after Vada was born.  Her only outlet is Thomas J., with whom she rides her bike to the lake and discusses all of the Big Issues (the meaning of life, love, death, which 70s TV family they&apos;d live with.) \n\n \tThe other momentous event of the summer is Vada developing her first crush. It isn&apos;t Thomas J. (who idolizes her), but her teacher, Mr. Bixler (Griffin Dunne).  He teaches a summer writing class at the local college, and Vada enrolls.  Besides being the youngest in the class, she is also the only one who hasn&apos;t been taken over by 1970s psychedelia (one day, the class takes part in a group meditation.)  \n\n\tThe strength of &quot;My Girl&quot; isn&apos;t its story, but its little nuances of innocent bliss.  Vada willingly shows a group of glowing boys a dead body. As the ride their bikes, Vada and Thomas J. sing `The Name Game&apos;.  When writing poems `from the soul&apos;, Vada writes an ode to ice cream.  The relationship between Harry and Shelly is sweet, too.  Before their first date, Harry&apos;s womanizing brother points out that since Harry&apos;s last date, a sexual revolution has occurred.  Of course, Shelly only desires a proper and old-fashioned gentleman, which very much complicates their first date.\n\n \tWell, I loved this film.  As a viewer, I try to watch for inconsistencies in the performances and the script, but this film had none.  Dan Aykroid and Jamie Lee Curtis bring a low-key charm to their roles.  Both have their flaws, and it sometimes seems they have nothing in common.  But for some inexplicable reason, they are brought together and their encounters are tactful, witty, and very real.\n\n\tAs for Anna Chlumsky, it can only be said that this young actress sets the standard for all child performances.  This is not a performance, in a traditional manner;  she eludes all cutesy standards of the traditional child performance, and becomes a complex, multi-dimensional person with true needs.  This little girl is extremely intelligent, and when Chlumsky delivers lines beyond her years, she doesn&apos;t do it with sarcasm or adorability, but with the oblivious nature that 11-year-olds find themselves in.  The world may be changing around her, but she tries her hardest to maintain her sanity and cheerfulness.\n\n\tThough &quot;My Girl&quot; is advertised as a kid&apos;s film, and kids would probably like it, this film is for adults.  It isn&apos;t always a happy film, and there is a major tragedy toward the end of the film.  But rather than sentimentalize, the tragedy serves as a bridge for young Vada in between the realms of innocence and childhood and the real world of loss and sadness. And as dark as &quot;My Girl&quot; may sometimes be, there is always a sense of charm and warmth brought to the screen by the characters.  This is a wonderful, wonderful film.",

      "reviewBody": "Terry Gilliam has made a lot of good films and a couple of great ones(namely Twelve Monkeys and Brazil)this, though could well be his best.\n\nWhy ?\n\nFor starters there is the cast.Jeff Bridges,officially the most underrated actor of his generation, giving a performance that veers from one end of the spectrum to the other almost imperceptibly.From comedy to tragedy and back again.\n\nRobin Williams- a great comedian and a better actor than he is given credit for.Fair enough he does tend to go through spells of making films primarily for his kids (Mrs.Doubtfire, Hook, Jack) but when he does decide to buckle down and do a serious role he rarely disappoints (Good Will Hunting, Insomnia, Dead Poets Society).It is with this role though that Williams gives what is the best of his career to date,as Parry. He is undoubtedly insane, but it is not yet too late for him, he justs needs someone to take the effort to save him, and if it had not been for Bridges colossal mistake and subsequent search for redemption, no-one would have done it, and he would never have survived, merely another casualty of another one of Gilliams nightmarish cityscapes. Mercedes Ruehl is perfect as Bridges suffering girlfriend.She thinks of herself as hard-bitten a survivor, and yet she continues to stay with Bridges, trying to prove to herself that she has the strength to change him, to redeem him. She wants to be his saviour, and yet he comes in the shape of a homeless madman, prone to dancing naked in Central Park and seeing floating fairies whilst defecating.The Fisher King is a movie about hope, despair and redemption, and all of the human conditions that fit in between.It contains one of the most inspired,beautiful scenes in recent memory,as Grand Central station transforms from a dingy,noisy concrete hole into a luscious, gorgeous ballroom, simply because of Lydia, Parrys love, the one thing that keeps him grounded in any semblance of reality.The chinese restaurant double- date in which Parry connects with her for the first time is both funny and touching, and makes what comes after even more tragic.\n\n It is at times tragic,brutal even but it&apos;s heart cannot be doubted,and it remains a wonderful success."

It&apos;s a set of tired old recycled and clichéd experiences and really isn&apos;t worth the 107 minutes it takes to watch it. For the most part the storyline is so tired and old. And after watching it I was also disappointed that Greg Kinnear had signed up for it. That I can remember, I&apos;ve always liked his acting and the roles he chose. But in this case, the writing was so, so poor that even if the makers of &quot;The Last Song&quot; signed up the best actors in Hollywood it couldn&apos;t save this film.

      "reviewBody": "Snitch (2013)\n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nSurprisenly effective drama about a father (Dwayne Johnson) who agrees to go undercover after his son is arrested in a drug bust, which could cost him at least ten years in prison. The father goes undercover to bring down a Mexican drug lord and soon finds himself in over his head. SNITCH was based around actual events, although I&apos;m guessing a lot of stuff was either left out or just blended together to get this story. With that said, those expecting a non-stop action picture like the trailers made this out to be might be disappointed because for the most part this is a straight drama. The action doesn&apos;t come into play until the very end of the picture but this certainly isn&apos;t a negative thing. The best thing going for the film is actually the performance of Johnson who turns in the best work of his career. What really shocked me was how believable he was in the role of a blue collar father who will stop at nothing to protect the son who really doesn&apos;t care for him. I really thought Johnson stole the picture with his acting because the screenplay really gives him quite a bit to play. Not only does his not play your typical action hero, he manages to make you believe that he&apos;s this scared guy who finds himself in over his head but at the same time he knows he must do what he has to to protect his son. The supporting cast is also extremely good with Susan Sarandon turning in a nice performance as a woman making the deals with the father. Jon Bernthal offers up a sensitive and believable performance as a father who gets dragged into the mess and the underrated Barry Pepper is extremely good in his role as an agent. Michael Kenneth Williams also delivers a good performance as a drug dealer. The film is pretty laid back for the most part and I thought this was an interesting approach by director Ric Roman Waugh who proves he can handle telling a story and casually building up the suspense. There are certainly some flaws with the story including it being way too easy for this father to get close to a major cartel but this isn&apos;t bad enough to where it kills the film. SNITCH is a pretty good drama that manages to grab your attention and really bring you close to this father character. A lot of credit goes to Johnson."

James Mardsen and Seth Green steals the show but up and coming actors: Josh Zuckerman and Clark Duke did extremely well for themselves and prove themselves to be the next big thing in the future. It is just about as funny than Superbad and American Pie (1,2,3) and the plot of the movie was just so simple and well-made. Hopefully, Sex Drive will be a teen classic in the next few years because it&apos;s extremely funny, raunchy &amp; has a little bit of it&apos;s sweet side, too. Sex Drive is awesome and super hilarious!!!",

      "reviewBody": "Director Gavin Hood&apos;s previous film, the underrated Ender&apos;s Game, focused upon the increasingly virtual, high-tech surveillance and disengaged nature of modern warfare. These elements of Ender&apos;s Game are clearly visible in the director&apos;s latest thriller offering, Eye in the Sky. The story here involves disparate groups of military and political personnel scattered around the world, all watching the live stream of a terrorist compound in Nairobi and debating whether or not to fire a drone into a heavily-populated ethnically Somali suburb of the Kenyan capital.\n\nThe operation is shown to be a joint British and American backed mission and the debate revolves around the collateral damage a drone strike would cause. The collateral damage is given a human face through a young girl who has set up a bread stall near the compound. Eye in the Sky&apos;s original title was &quot;Kill Chain&quot; and the reasoning becomes evident as the rest of the film involves people referring up the chain of command to avoid making a decision. The running time consists mainly of people talking to each other on phones and via video screens, however Hood manages to make these scenes some of the tensest, most cinematic, Skype calls you will ever see.\n\nEye in the Sky highlights the &quot;hawk&quot; and &quot;dove&quot; nature of the politicians of the two countries involved, one memorable scene being the US Secretary of State angry that his game of table tennis is interrupted because the British are dithering. However, the film&apos;s demonstration of realpolitik was weaker and has been presented far more successfully in Armando Iannucci&apos;s In the Loop, a film based on the run-up to the Iraq War. The film also lacked any strong, coherent argument against the drone strike apart from the contrived little girl selling bread nearby; not touching at all on the long-term consequences of dropping a bomb on a Somali suburb. The film reduces the complicated morality of drone warfare to a simplistic choice: it&apos;s either this little girl or a terrorist attack in a busy shopping mall. There&apos;s no concern however for civilians nearby who aren&apos;t cute children, or that the potential civilian casualties from this attack could be used by Al Shabab to garner more support amongst the population.\n\nAlan Rickman is fantastically dry in his last on-screen role as a British Lieutenant General and Aaron Paul is also very impressive, despite spending the majority of the film in a Portacabin with his finger hovering over the trigger. But while Eye in the Sky may be one of the year&apos;s most gripping thrillers, the film&apos;s morality is more dubious rather than ambiguous.",

      "reviewBody": "The Bling Ring pace was fast simply because the kids went from one burglary to the next without much else in between. The acting, what there was of it, was okay. And Emily Watson&apos;s Valley Girl accent was spot on. But, there was hardly any character development.\n\nHow did these well-off privileged kids turn into obsessive narcissists? What are they doing now? There was no reaction shown from the victims.\n\nThe kids parents played minor roles in the film and they showed little reaction to the crimes their kids committed.\n\nThe film seemed a rush through the plot without bringing into play all the elements that one would expect in this real life caper plot. In the end it seemed more like an outline for a film rather than a completed film.",

Shaolin Soccer is a harmless movie, the type that mentions the normal morals you might find in a children&apos;s movie (work in teams, don&apos;t let success go to your head, cheating is bad, etc.), without preaching them.\n\nSome Shaolin-trained, but for the most part poor and unhappy men get organized in a soccer team with a coach who was crippled in a soccer riot after losing the big game twenty years ago.  You&apos;ve got a variety of misfits--the spunky young&apos;n with the steel leg, the obese convenience store clerk who can nearly fly, the plutocratic salary man who uses a style reminiscent of Flying Chimpanzee&apos;s Cotton Belly in Wing Chun.  It&apos;s an odd little band, stretching from barely-post adolescent to nearly retirement age.  This rag-tag band is quite endearing and it works so well.\n\nSure, there are a few instances of cheap humor, but you&apos;ve got to expect this.  The visuals are fantastic, the characterization competent (even if you probably have seen the archetypes before), and it&apos;s a lot of fun, whether it&apos;s the parody of a war movie (which my friend called scant instants before it happened) or the somewhat unusual tribute to Bruce Lee (hint: it&apos;s all in the sunglasses).\n\nShould you see this movie?  Yes.  I&apos;d say this movie deserves 4 1/2 stars out of five based on technical merits, etc.  But on fun?  That&apos;s right, it gets a million billion stars.  Now let&apos;s see what Miramax cut out--25 minutes?  Crap."

      "reviewBody": "Turk (Robert De Niro) and Rooster (Al Pacino) are longtime NYC police partners, in this Jon Avnet thriller that has them trying to stop an unknown serial killer, a person who leaves a poem at the scene of each crime. Victims are law-breakers who were freed on legal technicalities. Two other cops, played by John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg, become suspicious of the investigation, and this hampers the efforts of Turk and Rooster.\n\nThe script on which the film is based is rather poor. The setup is muddled; none of the characters are especially sympathetic, and secondary characters are not well defined. Further, &quot;Righteous Kill&quot; is not that much different from other serial killer or urban crime films.\n\nThe mood here is dark, and the tone is rather cynical. Characters go out of their way to telegraph their toughness by using lots of &quot;hard&quot; language. There&apos;s an edginess to the characters, and that&apos;s okay. But I could have wished for a character with some degree of softness. That would have provided much needed balance to the overall tonal savagery.\n\nWithout a doubt, the film&apos;s best element is the acting. There&apos;s not a weak performance in the bunch. Of course, the focus is on De Niro and Pacino. This is really their film. And it&apos;s their camaraderie, their back and forth playful banter, that makes the film worth watching. Production design and costumes are credible. Color cinematography is generally dark, consistent with the story&apos;s mood.\n\nIn spite of a weak script, &quot;Righteous Kill&quot; does provide some good plot misdirection that will leave viewers unsure as to the story&apos;s outcome. But the film&apos;s main virtue is the casting of De Niro and Pacino, two contemporary screen legends whose performances here are quite good.",

      "reviewBody": "I finally got around to seeing this film and frankly I was not shocked; probably because I had read about its grossness far in advance. What I wasn&apos;t prepared for was the fact that a large part of the grossness was not actually shown, but rather spoken of and indirectly seen through bandage attachments. At some points it was very Hithcockian in the fear was instilled indirectly. Graphs showed how the surgery would be accomplished; only bits of the surgery were actually shown; the graphic defecation scene was verbalized and intimated. Very Hitchcock were the master of suspense a tad more mad. However, the scariest part of the film was Dieter Laser&apos;s performance. I can&apos;t recall ever seeing a mad scientist on film that projected madness and insanity as deeply as Mr. Laser..Every time he was on screen you could feel your skin crawl with fear. Brilliant performance, mainly because it went to the edge of &quot;over the top&quot; but never actually got over the top. I&apos;ve also read reviews which damned the actresses for not being &quot;good actresses&quot;. A bunch of hooey for sure from those observers. I&apos;d like to see them top the girls &quot;tongue in cheek&quot; performances. I never for a moment didn&apos;t see fear in their eyes, which btw is also another means of showing more fear than the actually surgery which was done while the cast was under anesthetics. In the beginning of the film you could feel the chemistry of the girls as they giggled about in their hotel room. A definite chemistry; one which would be needed as they got closer to each other at the Dr.&apos;s house. Hats off to this film for sever reasons; suspense, fear and scare without an overload of blood and gore as in other films. Think of the Akitamura&apos;s job of convincing us that he was frightened, angry and scared in his native Japanese tongue, while again having tongue in cheek fears to contend with of his own character. Bottom line: An original, at the edge, horror film. Where does on go after that..kudos to the cast for braving out a fully developed and overly imaginative film..and to Mr. Six for following through. Can you imagine the sales pitch he had to prepare? Besides, our news media shows more graphic crap than this on their 24/7 newscasts (eg. There was more gore with Kadhafi killing, etc.)"

      "reviewBody": "Some movies have a coherent plot that is told in a non-straightforward fashion, or that is open to several interpretations, or that leaves out some parts requiring the audience to fill-in (e.g. an open end), and possibly this filling-in can be done in more than one way. These movies require several viewings and considerable thought to make sense.\n\nAfter watching The Wailing for the first time, I had the impression that it was this kind of movie. However, after watching it again, pondering it, and then reading and watching attempts by various people to interpret/explain it, I have come to a different conclusion. Namely, this movie does not have a coherent underlying plot. No matter how you shift the pieces of the puzzle in an attempt to recreate a coherent narrative, some pieces will never fit together, and not due to your incompetence, but because the underlying story is - possibly intentionally, possibly not - fundamentally inconsistent. It&apos;s like one of those optical illusions or Escher drawings that appear to describe a physical object, but in fact don&apos;t make physical sense.\n\nAccordingly, whether one enjoys this movie or not boils down to whether one can be content with a movie that is technically well-made (cinematography, acting, costumes, etc.), but (a) its plot makes no sense, and (b) it is told in a deceptive way as to lure you into thinking that the plot would make sense if only you gave the matter sufficient thought, thus leaving you with a lingering, irritating feeling of dissatisfaction and confusion.\n\nAnd maybe this is precisely the point of the movie: rather than telling a story, its purpose is to instill in the audience a feeling of confusion in the face of a sequence of events that almost, but not quite, makes sense. Much like life at times, no?"

I&apos;ll give you an example of its bad script, in the movie the characther says &quot;Bienvenido&quot; which means Welcome, but in the context of the conversation she means to say &quot;Your Welcome&quot;, &quot;De nada&quot; in Spanish. It seems they did the writing in French and use google for translation. Yes, it covers some important themes and issues, but that doesn&apos;t make your movie good.

      "reviewBody": "On the page &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; often read like a reject from Mills and Boon and yet it was tremendously popular. People who normally wouldn&apos;t read this sort of thing were not only reading it but quoting it. You could say that for some people it held the kind of camp appeal that bad books sometimes do for the so-called intelligentsia. Personally, I am inclined to think that its tale of middle-aged romance struck a cord. It may not have been well-written but many people recognized in its two central characters a reflection of themselves. It spoke of a great passion and a great loss; a &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; for the nineties. Still, it never quite seemed like a vehicle for Clint Eastwood; (once upon a time you might have envisaged Arthur Hiller doing it), yet here it is, larger than life on the big screen and utterly lovely, utterly heart-breaking.\n\nPerhaps Eastwood chose to film it as a vehicle for himself. He wears the mantle of the ageing Lothario perfectly at an age when most romantic leads are played by much younger men, (or are simply non-existent), yet who blanched when Gary Cooper or Cary Grant were wooing Audrey Hepburn well into their old age. Admittedly Eastwood isn&apos;t entirely comfortable in this sort of role. He&apos;s not a versatile actor. His best performances have been as tortured losers or just old-fashioned tough guys but under his own direction he blossoms here. Of course, the &apos;romantic&apos; in Eastwood has never been hard to find. You need look only to the scores he has composed. (He has written the main love theme here and his use of classic jazz standards by the likes of Dinah Washington and Johnny Hartman adds considerably to the film&apos;s beating heart).\n\nWhat is remarkable is that essentially Eastwood&apos;s film is really something of a chamber piece for two players. A few other characters flit into the frame but for most of the time there is no one on screen but Eastwood and co-star Meryl Streep and this is one of Streep&apos;s great performances. As Francesca, the woman who finds in Eastwood&apos;s photographer Robert the one great passion in her life albeit briefly and at a time when the likelihood of such a thing happening was remote indeed, Streep is extraordinary. Sometimes Streep can overwhelm a project; her versatility doesn&apos;t always work in favour of lesser material. But here she seems to have tapped quite effortlessly, not just into the consciousness of her character, but into her very soul as well. And if that sounds cheesy, let me assure you it isn&apos;t. Cheesiness isn&apos;t in Streep&apos;s vocabulary, even if it is in mine! Perhaps Eastwood was able to discern in Robert James Waller&apos;s novel the seeds of a great love story or perhaps he just felt he could bring his artistry to bear on some unlikely source material. Whatever, it&apos;s paid off. On screen &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; is a great love story; there won&apos;t be a dry eye in the house.",

Every scene, every line every moment of this &apos;movie&apos; was unfunny, awkward, unrealistic (even for an unrealistic movie) and seriously unentertaining (not a word I know). Just when I thought the movie was over, it makes you sit through these stupid clips of real life twins saying &apos;funny&apos; things about being a twin.

He is raising his two children who are also trying to become published. While his children are trying to figure their lives out William is stuck between trying to move on with his love life or keep waiting for his ex to return. This is a movie that I had high expectations for basically because I really like Greg Kinnear. This movie is very much like Crazy Stupid Love in tone so if you like that movie you will like this one as well. The acting in this is great as would be expected and this is a very real life type movie. Everyone in this is flawed but nothing to outrageous or unbelievable. That fact alone made the movie seem real and grounded. There really isn&apos;t much I can say without giving things away but I do recommend this and I did like it a lot. Overall, fans of Crazy Stupid Love will really like this. I give it a B.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. &quot;An indie gem&quot; is meant to be a term of respect for a little movie that manages to make an emotional connection, usually while being screened at a film festival or in a very limited and brief theatrical run. The best ones drive us to encourage everyone we know to take the time to see it. Such is writer/director Destin Cretton&apos;s latest.\n\nSome movies offer a promising premise and then let us down with faulty execution. Short Term 12 is actually better than its premise would lead you to expect. Credit goes to Mr. Cretton&apos;s quasi-documentary directorial style, tremendous acting from support characters played by John Gallagher Jr (Mason), Kaitlyn Dever (Jayden), and Keith Stanfield (Marcus), and a stunning lead performance from rising star Brie Larson (Grace).\n\nGrace and Mason help run a foster care facility. We witness first hand their daily work with the kids, some of it quite mundane ... though other moments incredibly powerful. Grace and Marcus have their own personal connections to this way of life, and also happen to be in a relationship that seems built on avoiding the communication and connection that goes into their daily jobs.\n\nThe use of art as a communication device plays a role throughout. Marcus uses his rap lyrics, newcomer Jayden draws and writes children&apos;s stories. These two kids are particularly important because they also mirror the inner sanctum of Mason and Grace, and we see these people all battle demons in hope of living a &quot;normal&quot; life. This is not a story of saints and sinners ... these are just people coming to grip with the deck they&apos;ve been dealt.\n\nYou will recognize Gallagher from his work on HBO&apos;s &quot;Newsroom&quot;, and Dever made quite an impression in her time on &quot;Justified&quot;. Larson&apos;s star is on the rise thanks to her presence in The Spectacular Now and Don Jon, as well as some upcoming projects. She IS what critics have been trying make Greta Gerwig ... an actress who breathes life into character we feel we know.",

The characters personalities were completely changed to the point where I didn&apos;t see why they even bothered maintaining the original names and The events of the story were changed so drastically I forgot that I was watching Death Note. In the original anime both L and Light were very calm and rational in how they made each decision, creating a suspenseful psychological drama, but in the film both of them do things that were very out of character and essentially made no sense. Overall this felt very rushed and poorly directed, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the director had never even heard of the original anime before doing this film."

I certainly wasn&apos;t, but sometimes that&apos;s okay - sometimes you just want an excuse to laugh.\n\nStill, I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed with what they did here. The fault lies with the screenplay. For starters, it is not exactly original. While I wouldn&apos;t call this movie a blatant rip-off of &quot;Stakeout&quot;, in several regards it&apos;s too close to that earlier movie for its own good. Speaking of familiar, another problem I had was that too many of the gags involving Lawrence as the cross-dressing FBI agent I had more or less seen in other movies before. Plus, the movie devotes far too much time to this than fleshing out the story - if what&apos;s here could be considered a story.\n\nOn the positive side, the movie is filled with energy, both in front of and behind the camera. There&apos;s enough energy that some viewers not wanting to think while watching a movie might find the enterprise enjoyable enough. If that sounds like you, you&apos;ll probably find this movie adequate. If you want more nutrition in your cinematic diet, look elsewhere."

The plot is, I admit, weak in places. That doesn&apos;t matter though - this film isn&apos;t about cerebral entertainment, it&apos;s about car chases and jokes, and humour is something the French do very well. The car chases are spectacular - and far better, for my money, than the car chases featured in Gone in 60 Seconds, The Matrix Reloaded or The Fast and the Furious. Hollywood could do a lot worse than look over the Atlantic to see how car movies are made. Unfortunately, it now seems that they have but I didn&apos;t mean that they should copy the French, they need original ideas, but they also need to imitate the French flair. The jokes come thick and fast, and had me howling with laughter - it takes a lot of humour for me to forgive an absence of plot - this film has it in spades. So there you have it. Ignore the American rip off. Watch the original. You won&apos;t regret it."

Her innocence is so believable that we go with her wherever she decides to go. I wish the producers and responsible for this movie getting made had gone all the way and provided this extraordinary comic talent with a more substantial script and direction giving her the opportunity to shine even more than she shines here and here shine she does, big time. Just look at her listening, trying to make sense of what&apos;s happening around her. Deeply moving, very funny, kind of unique. I hope she soon finds her Garson Kanin and her George Cukor. I have the feeling we ain&apos;t seen nothing yet",

Admittedly, I did not find the jokes funny at all. Considering this is a show for kids (correct me if I am wrong), I would have imagined that kids would love this movie.\n\nLily Collins is a beautiful young lady with high potential to become a great actress.

Some reviewers have focused on the boys or the father or the mother. Different scenes have been noted, almost none by more than one reviewer. What this tells me is that the writer/director has crafted a story in which all of the scenes contribute to the whole. This was my experience watching the movie. It was believable, well shot, great backgrounds, all in all a treat for anyone who loves movies and can handle some pretty raw dialog/situations.....and nothing gets blown up.\n\nI would recommend this only for adults or a very mature teenager. The language and situations are tough but as I said, very believable. I identified with much of what the teens in this movie are going through and my sympathies definitely sided with them against their self-involved and self-indulgent parents. This is the best role I&apos;ve ever seen Jeff Daniels in and having known men in my life like his character I think he was spot-on with his portrayal. There were no weak characterizations with any of the actors, for that matter.",

After a gleaming light blankets over Los Angeles one random morning @430am, it lures people outside. Looking directly into the light causes a dire effect which is part of the problem. None of that is explained. Eric Balfour is a good looking leading man, pity his chiseled features out weigh his acting ability. However in his defence, the script sucks, I could write a better one over breakfast. The special effects are certainly effective for the most part. My favourite moments are when the bad boy aliens are on the attack against Stealth jets and the view from the rooftops are outstanding visuals. The trailer was certainly interesting and the film simply doesn&apos;t back up the premise. War of the worlds and Independence Day have had a baby, it&apos;s called SKYLINE. Worth a look, it&apos;s a good sci-fi curiosity and the female leads are all gorgeous which helps matters with such a soft screenplay.",

Since &quot;Playing by Heart&quot; thought us that &quot;Talking about love is like dancing about architecture.&quot; this movie tries to add an extensive visual layer to the story and it does it rather successfully. Some might find this movie to be pretentious and full of &quot;shallow philosophizing&quot; and &quot;excessive nudity&quot;, but these are absurd statements. The thing that comes across is that this movie never takes itself too seriously and this is it&apos;s strong point. You are there to watch and enjoy and if you pick up something &quot;meaningful&quot; out of the entire babbling of the main character, good for you. If not, you&apos;ll still be happy just for all the eye candy presented to you. A win-win. And that&apos;s always good in my book.",

As a retired man turned vigilante and taking the law into his own hands as judge , jury and executioner. As every man has a breaking point . Harry turns the one-man vigilante when his friend is attacked , beaten and then stabbed to death in an underground passage carried out by furious band formed by some ominous punks . Then he stalks the slums of London and takes the law into his own hands, searching vengeance on crooks, hoodlums, druggies , muggers, pimps , making the neighborhood safer and bumping off delinquents and street scum . Meanwhile , police officers D.I. Alice Frampton (Emily Mortimer) and D.S. Terry Hicock (Charlie Creed-Miles) are investigating the deeds and Police Superintendent Childs (Iain Glen) orders a major arrest operation believing the recent violence is related to a gang war. The late-night raids on the neighbourhood result in a massive riot .\n\nThis interesting picture has suspense , emotion , intrigue , thrills and lots of violence . It&apos;s certainly thrilling , though the morality may be questionable , even in this time, as the spectators were clearly on the Harry Brown&apos;s side . Michael Caine with his usual top-notch acting displays efficiently his weapon such as ¨Harry the Dirty¨ and killing mercilessly nasties . Michael Caine saw a lot of himself in the character of Harry Brown, e.g. they&apos;re both combat veterans , as Harry is a Marine who served in Northern Ireland, Caine served in the British Army during the Korean war , and Caine lived in the same area that Brown does , it was things like these that drew him to the film . Secondary cast is frankly excellent such as Emily Mortimer , Charlie Creed-Miles , David Bradley , Iain Glen , Sean Harris, Ben Drew and special mention to Liam Cunningham as Sid Rourke . This is Daniel Barber&apos;s nice feature debut , he&apos;s now shooting ¨The keeping room¨ with Hailee Steinfeld , Sam Worthington and Brit Marling .\n\nThis exciting and above average film belong to ¨Vigilante genre¨ whose main representations are ¨Charles Bronson&apos;s Death Wish¨ , successful crime thriller that created the Vigilante genre with Bronson as the main star such as ¨Death wish II¨ ¨Death wish III¨ , ¨Death Wish 4 : The crackdown¨and ¨Death Wish: The face of death¨ and , of course , ¨Clint Eastwood&apos;s Dirty Harry¨ movies , such as ¨The enforcers¨, ¨Sudden impact¨ and ¨The dead pool¨ . Furthermore , other notorious movies on the ¨Revenger¨ genre that achieved their splendor in the eighties are the followings : ¨Exterminator¨ I and II with Robert Ginty ; ¨Vigilante¨ by William Lusting with Robert Foster , Fred Williamson ; ¨Walking the edge¨ by Norbert Meisel with Robert Foster and Nancy Kwan ; ¨Dark Angel¨ with Betty Russell ; ¨Steele Justice¨ with Martin Kove ¨; ¨The Punisher¨ with Dolph Lundgren , ¨Joe Don Baker&apos;s Walking tall¨ saga ; ¨Lorenzo Lamas&apos;s Snake eater¨ saga , ¨Arnold&apos;s Raw Deal¨ , ¨Stallone&apos;s Cobra¨ and many others .",

The traps are immaculate and absolutely disgusting (In a good way), and it&apos;s a more &quot;horror&quot; styled movie. Horrible things happen to horrible people, and you can&apos;t help yourself from sitting there and thinking, &quot;please don&apos;t be over, please don&apos;t be over.&quot; Overall I would give this movie a 7.5/10, it exceeded expectations, the gore was great, and the story is pretty good.

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not sure if Jim Jarmusch (&quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot;) in Paterson wants to make America great again by giving us his vision of the way it used to be, or is telling us that we only have to look around us to discover that it&apos;s great right now. Performed by a brilliantly authentic Adam Driver (&quot;Midnight Special&quot;), Paterson is not only the name of the city in New Jersey known for its resident poet William Carlos Williams, but is also his name. He is a poet whose Haiku-like verses (actually written by Ron Padgett) are reminiscent of the city&apos;s own poet William Carlos Williams. He writes a new poem every day (or finishes an old one) on the #23 bus he drives before and during his trip. Though his loving, energetic, somewhat scattered wife Laura (Golshifteh Farahani, &quot;Finding Altamira&quot;) keeps asking him to make copies of them, he resists the idea, preferring to keep them in his secret notebook.\n\nThe film has little conflict, family dysfunction, or mental health issues. It is about what works and even (wonder of wonders) about a marriage that is not falling apart. Like most people with jobs and families, Paterson has a daily routine. There&apos;s too much variation in his day to call it a takeoff on Groundhog Day, but it does have that &quot;same old, same old&quot; quality. He awakes shortly after 6am, has a bowl of cereal that looks suspiciously like Cheerios, walks to his job driving the #23 bus through the streets of Paterson, listening in on conversations (often with a broad smile on his face) of passengers who talk about anything from Italian anarchists to boxer Hurricane Carter and comedian Lou Costello.\n\nHe comes home at six, corrects a leaning mailbox that moves daily thanks to his grumpy English bulldog Marvin (RIP), has dinner (some on the exotic side) talks with Laura who fills him in on the many projects she has going on including painting black and white circles on draperies, learning to play the guitar, and making cupcakes to sell at the local farmers market. He then takes Marvin for a walk and goes for a beer at the local pub where he chats with the owner Doc (Barry Shabaka Henley, &quot;Carrie&quot;), and often acts as a moderator between Everett (William Jackson Harper, &quot;True Story&quot;), a dramatic actor who desperately wants to reunite with his ex-wife Maria (Chasten Harmon.\n\nThe poems that Paterson reads as the words are flashed on the screen are not about odes to nightingales (though there&apos;s nothing wrong with that) but about down-to-earth things, such as one about matches, inspired by Ohio Blue Tip matchboxes that have disappeared from our lives. In &quot;The Run,&quot; he says, &quot;I go through trillions of molecules that move aside to make way for me while on both sides trillions more stay where they are. The windshield wiper blade starts to squeak. The rain has stopped. I stop. On the corner a boy in a yellow raincoat holding his mother&apos;s hand.&quot; In other poems he lets the world know how much he is in love with his wife, though he confides in us that he occasionally looks at other woman, something which as far as I know is still legal.\n\nTo Paterson, a poem should be simple and direct and he is moved by one such poem by a 9-year-old girl who recites it to him while she is waiting for her mother and sister. He complements her on her poem about a waterfall, remembering a few lines and reciting them to Laura when he gets home. Contrary to most films where, except for films about wealthy financial elites, work does not play a big role in the life of the characters, Paterson makes real what daily living is about for a majority of working people. The film has warmth and humor wrapped in a portrait of a city which has seen better days, a city in which Jarmusch creates a structure of closely observed small moments revealed with empathy.\n\nPaterson is a man who is not looking for life to give him satisfaction but who brings satisfaction to it, a man who knows that satisfaction does not depend on accumulating things but in being grounded in who you are and what you can bring to the world. He comes to appreciate that poetry is not extraneous to life but that life itself is poetry. Although the film presents an idealistic picture of a city without visible slums, drugs, and crime which we know exists, Jarmusch may be providing us with a welcome counterpoint, showing us the way our cities should be and can be again.",

      "reviewBody": "Although John Hughes didn&apos;t direct this film, his steady hand is evident all throughout in this much more serious story about a poor girl and a rich guy who want to be together despite all odds against them. Despite the more serious tone of this movie, it still has some funny and touching scenes, most of them featuring Duckie, the best friend of Andie and perhaps the man that truly loves her. However, she has her heart set on Blane, the rich preppie who claims he doesn&apos;t act like his snobbish friends do but it is hard to tell at times.\n\nWhat makes this movie so great is how it is willing to treat all these kids as adults in real situations and real emotions. The acting accentuates these overtones with Molly Ringwald in perhaps her most sophisticated role, Jon Cryer as the lovable Duckie, Andrew McCarthy as Blane, and James Spader in a perfectly devilish role as Steff, the worst of the bunch by so smooth and relentless, it is hard not to be impressed by him. All in all, this is one of the better 1980s teen movies and one that I think people will remember more fondly as it isn&apos;t so overtly unique that people can relate to the characters and feel for them. Unfortunately, it was essentially the end of the Molly Ringwald-era, but her memory in these three Hughes movies will always stay with us.",

      "reviewBody": "I think there is a valid argument to make that the universal visceral impact that Funny Games has on audiences undermines the very thesis of its director Michael Haneke. I use the word thesis very deliberately because Funny Games is an intellectual academic statement. Plainly it is not an entertainment movie but I don&apos;t consider it to be an art film either. Haneke intended it to be neither in my opinion. I think he intended it as an assault on both Hollywood and the audience. It&apos;s the cinematic equivalent of punk. Rock music against rock music. This is an analogy Haneke draws the audience to himself by overriding the classical music Anna and Georg are listening to with some extreme punk music on the sound track. We are left in doubt that the world of Funny Games belongs to Peter and Paul. Anna and Georg and their bourgeois taste in music are treated with utter contempt before Peter and Paul even appear on the screen.\n\nGetting back to my original point: I think there are two parts to Haneke&apos;s thesis. The first is that Hollywood has commodified and sanitised violence and turned it into thrilling entertainment. Hollywood violence doesn&apos;t show the reality of violence or its consequences on those it is inflicted on. The second part of his thesis is that Hollywood&apos;s portrayal of violence has dehumanised and inured the audience and reduced their capacity for empathy and sensitivity. I fully agree with the first part of his thesis. The problem is most people do. I think you would be hard pushed to find any reasonably intelligent, educated person who doesn&apos;t agree with Haneke in this regard. Anyone who doesn&apos;t isn&apos;t going to be enlightened by watching Funny Games. On this point I can&apos;t help feeling that he preaching to the converted.\n\nIt&apos;s the second part of his thesis that he inadvertently undermines. Haneke set out very deliberately to make violence real again so that the audience feels it in their gut. Funny Games isn&apos;t real violence though. It&apos;s still just a film. However it is a film that manages to make a huge impact on an audience well accustomed to watching violence on the screen. This clearly indicates to me that audiences are smart enough and sensitive enough to be able to tell the difference between Hollywood trite and a convincing portrayal of violence. You could argue that Haneke had to resort to making such an extreme film to have the intended impact on an audience dulled by years of cinematic violence. However Funny Games isn&apos;t actually that violent. Compared to the average Arnold Swarzenegger movie it&apos;s actually quite tame in both the quantity of violence and how graphically it&apos;s portrayed. What makes Funny Games so disturbing is the emotional content in the impact and consequences of the violence on the victims. This is effectively contrasted with the casual approach, understated sadism and emotional shallowness of the perpetrators. If audiences were as lacking in sensitivity as I think Haneke is suggesting then surely Funny Games would have simply have been accepted as another piece of horror entertainment.\n\nHaneke said something along the lines that anyone who stops watching before the end doesn&apos;t need Funny Games, anyone who watches it to the end does need it. This strikes me as thoroughly arrogant and is quite wrong in my opinion. Nothing can be implied about anyone who watches it to the end and there is no such thing as a film that an audience needs. Funny Games is a superb piece of cinema and there is no doubt that Haneke was fully successful in what he set out to achieve. However what exactly is it that Haneke thinks that the audience needs from it? As I said earlier most of the audience already understands the point he is making about Hollywood. It seems to me that Haneke is trying to shame the audience into realising how immoral they are for watching violent films. I fundamentally disagree with him if this is his intention. Personally I have no problem with the cartoon violence of Hollywood for the very reason that it is lacking in any real emotional content. It would seem that Haneke not only has a problem with the cartoon violence in films but with actual cartoons. Both Tom and Jerry and Beavis and Butthead are referenced in Funny Games. If Haneke is seriously suggesting that Tom and Jerry cartoons are a moral problem then he is beyond ridiculous.\n\nHaving said all this I still give Funny Games a 10 out of 10. Whether we agree with Haneke or not he made us react, think, defend and argue. He also made a truly remarkable film with some of the most heart breaking and profound acting I have ever seen. Funny Games a deeply intelligent film and I don&apos;t doubt Haneke&apos;s total sincerity and moral integrity. I just don&apos;t necessarily agree with him.",

      "reviewBody": "When was the last time you saw a feel good movie? When was the last time you laughed at simple silly conversations, when was the last time you remembered your bachelor days (only if you are married), when was the last time a movie made you think about your life, when was the last time a movie inspired you to enjoy the simple things in life, when was the last time a movie inspires you to let go off your fears..... Well not in the near past, definitely not from Bollywood. \n\nZindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes you through the simple moments of life, the life that every one miss out due to their busy schedule, commitments, etc..etc... and the movie does it through the life of three friends and their extended bachelor party trip. The beauty of the movie is that it concentrates on the life of the friends and how they let go their resistance to themselves and their fears rather than showing obscenity that normally rules movies which are based on bachelor party trips. \n\nZoya does a fantastic job in making the viewers feel every part of the movie with a beautiful blend of nature, good camera work, good script and three gifted actors. There is not a moment in the movie which feels out of place, no songs which you feel is there to enhance the marketability of the movie, everything flows smoothly, everything blends so nicely which gives you the feel good factor that you expect from the movie. \n\nAll the actors were fabulous and were perfect fit for the roles. To start in alphabetic order i will start with Abhay. What to say about this actor, he brings life to his roles and he has proved it over and over in his movies. I couldn&apos;t think about any actor who could have blended so well with the character in the movie like Abhay did. There is no replacement for him. I cant enhance on his character as it will give away the plot. The scenes where all the three friends make fun of people through their silly childhood act under the leadership of Abhay can only be carried out well by Abhay.\n\nHritik is an actor who can do wonders when he lands the right roles. When even the new entrants avoids multi starrier movies, he has taken a role where other actors share more or less the same screen space, with no insecurity and no ego. In the movie you get to see a completely different Hritik, with a script which does not glorify him, he is just a friend among the three and he brings life to the movie with his charm and charisma. \n\nFarhan was bit of a surprise to me. He has grown as an actor from &quot;Rock on&quot; and &quot;Karthik calling Karthik&quot;. I always found him to be more fit for a serious character than for the joker in the pack act. He does it extremely well. Probably its because of my prejudice that it was hard for me to take him in the role, but i had to let go my resistance.\n\nKatrina portrays a character which is similar to her real life, a mix breed of Indian and Brit, a freedom loving, &quot;live today&quot; kind of girl. Her combination with Hritik is electrifying. Kalki is such a good actress. Her expressions helps you relate well to the character. \n\nThere is nothing to give out as a story, its all about three friends on a trip and trying out different things that they never tried before and how those things change there lives. But the beauty is in the details and climax. I think how the movie ends could have been better but song at the end of the movie with the credit makes up for it. \n\nOverall Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara impressed me and lived up to my expectation and above. I hope you would like the movie too. But &apos;hey&apos;, everyone has different opinions, the general review by the critics for the last two movies i reviewed were totally against mine. So don&apos;t go for the review rather go for the movie and decide for yourselves.\n\nRead my reviews on the site www.Movierecycle.com",

      "reviewBody": "One of my all-time favorite comedies is Slap Shot, so I had at least a marginal interest in seeing Goon. After reading a recent interview with Baruchel in the Vancouver Sun, the movie sounded like it just might have the heart to carry the flame that Slap Shot lit. Sure, no question, Goon comes off as somewhat of an homage, but it&apos;s done right, not overtly, balancing the necessary brutality and tastelessness with just enough sweetness. Which is a hell of a lot more than I can say for that pitiful attempt at a Slap Shot sequel.\n\nI&apos;m also not usually a fan of Seann William Scott&apos;s typecast everybrah, but his portrayal of Dougie Glatt as a soft-spoken and polite bruiser really is charming. The movie&apos;s not without its flaws: Sure, Baruchel&apos;s character is irritating and barely necessary, and Eugene Levy is tragically underused, and the subplot with the love interest is kinda out-of-place, but I overlooked those things because the meat of the movie is gold. The comedy is solid, the teammate/coach characters are amazing, and the film&apos;s sheer love of the game really, really shines through.\n\nSo my recommendation is ya pick up a twelve of Moosehead, throw on your old Chiefs jersey, and hunker down for a lot of laughs.",

This is like a modern version of The Big Chill- typical family issues solved through dilemmas and hugs and jocularity. It&apos;s people sitting around and laughing at the craziness of it all.\n\nI&apos;ve seen it all before but it works. The reason it works is its casting. Actors who are grounded and real and you can feel true empathy from them. Actors who always have emotion or depth no matter what the role.\n\nThis isn&apos;t going to go deep on a psych level or rip apart what the foundations of marriage might be but it does offer a couple nice lemon twists you don&apos;t see coming. Overall its a good watch and feels like an afternoon spent with friends.",

She deserves all the awards she got and if she didnt get any award for acting by any association(SAG), then such association is bunch of morons who dont know what acting is..

      "reviewBody": "Jeunet and Caro, with the help of their familiar repertory of actors, create a deeply disturbing and violent world where only a few shreds of conventional social mores remain. These scraps of morality only serve to delineate more clearly the overall decline and collapse of their dystopia. We see a butcher&apos;s shop; the proprietor, played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus, is evil almost to the point of caricature. He only manages to survive by killing his lodgers when they get behind with the rent and selling them as meat. However, the situation is given an added twist when we learn that all the lodgers are aware of this; a woman who is sold a joint of mother sheds a couple of stifled tears and mutters she would have liked to have said goodbye. Similarly, the butcher is most apologetic when he accidentally chops off the foot of one of his clients who has paid his rent in full.\n\n Into this hellish world is placed someone with his moral values relatively intact. In this case, it is a circus performer played by the marvellously rubber-faced Dominique Pinon. A less engaging actor might have made this character seem two-dimensional, as he appears to have no faults whatsoever (except a set of over-mobile lips). He enthrals the lodgers&apos; children with his games, is immensely chivalrous to the butcher&apos;s daughter and plays the musical saw. Finally, an old edition of his act is broadcast on the flickering black-and-white television, and even the most bloodthirsty lodgers are amazed and delighted. The butcher&apos;s jealousy is roused; Good and Innocence is forced to fight Evil and Hatred.\n\nAs such, the plot is relatively straightforward. It is the sheer surrealistic imagination that Jeunet and Caro bring to their films that prevent them being unremittingly bleak or simple morality tales. They display a brilliant sense of musical timing- the whole building frequently becomes an orchestra of creaking bed-springs, croaking frogs, and crackling radios; above all this soars a love-duet of a cello and a musical saw. The faded `look&apos; of the film complements this. With the exception of a single television remote control, nothing here would be out of place in in a exhibition of 40s and 50s design. In `The City of Lost Children&apos; the exuberance of the design threatens to swamp the slender storyline on occasions; here, the more `grown-up&apos; themes and less fantastic design go hand in hand.\n\n(A word of warning about the video release- the subtitles appear to have been written be a couple of Frenchmen who really ought to have concentrated harder in their English classes at school. Apart from that, I wholeheartedly recommend this joyously grotesque film.)"

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m putting down 8/10 for a &quot;rating&quot;, but basically I have no idea how to put a movie like this numerically in comparison with just about any Hollywood effort. It really belongs on a different scale entirely. My wife and I are just back from seeing it at our local art-cinema theater and we liked it very much. Stylistically, for other recent movies it&apos;s close to &quot;Roma&quot; and also the American indie film &quot;Leave No Trace&quot; as bittersweet, unhurried explorations of quite real human beings working hard to survive.\n\n&quot;Shoplifters&quot; follows the lives of a makeshift &quot;family&quot; living in the underside of an unnamed Japanese city (the particular place isn&apos;t important). The adults scrape by with low-security, low-paid jobs, the grandma has a small pension income, and the kids are vagabonds. They get by in a crowded, ramshackle tenement and the two kids are busy picking up the techniques of petty shoplifting from the adults. We slowly learn that almost none of them are actually related; they&apos;ve haphazardly chosen each other to live with in a framework a little outside the margins of normal society. All of them, in some way, have left or been taken out of abusive or dangerous previous relationships. Throughout their exploits, told by a long series of short vignette scenes, is that they indeed feel close bonds but that their &quot;family&quot; is built, not by blood, but by the constant kindness they show towards each other. They survive on the margins, but they love and are loved.\n\nThe second and much more subliminal big message I took away from this film was its ambience: it&apos;s quiet. Scenes that would -- in a Hollywood film -- predictably lead to shouting matches or displays of anger or confrontations with authority, *never* take that cheap overdramatized route here. When confronted with tough questions, the main characters answer reflectively and with spare honesty. Even out on the streets with traffic and lots of people around, it&apos;s quiet. What a change.\n\nToward the end of the film, the main characters are being patiently interviewed by social services staff in a series of magnetically powerful scenes. The &quot;family&quot; members&apos; answers are often startling: &quot;Why were you teaching your son to shoplift?&quot; &quot;I ... didn&apos;t know anything else to teach him.&quot; or: &quot;Didn&apos;t you take your grandma and threw her away?&quot; &quot;No. Someone else threw her away; we took her in.&quot; or: &quot;The child belongs with her mother.&quot; &quot;No. Giving birth doesn&apos;t make her a mother.&quot; From small glimpses like this, a window opens into an entire world of human nature.",

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re thinking that this film has a familiar look to it that&apos;s because The Longest Ride And The Notebook are both originating from the pen of Nicholas Sparks. This is the story of a seemingly mismatched young couple Scott Eastwood and Britt Robertson and an old man with his memories who cements their relationship.\n\nNostalgia is bursting all over the place with The Longest Ride. Scott Eastwood, son of Clint Eastwood is an aspiring bull rider competing in the Professional Bull Riders who gets dumped in the lap of spectator Britt Robertson. That&apos;s a plot gambit borrowed A Lady Takes A Chance where John Wayne made the acquaintance of Jean Arthur that way. \n\nAs her girlfriends tell her who wouldn&apos;t want to make it with a cowboy and I can agree there. But while the chemistry is there, they come from different worlds. Eastwood is the son of a bull rider and he lives on the ranch that he inherited from his dad with his mother Lolita Davidovitch. He knows his days as a professional bull rider are limited and he wants the prize money while he still can afford. He&apos;s flirting dangerously with permanent injury and death more than most bull riders as he&apos;s had a dangerous concussion already.\n\nRobertson is an art history major and wants a career in that and may move to New York as that&apos;s the capital of the art world in the USA. Somebody is going to have to make a sacrifice.\n\nOne day both save the life of an elderly Alan Alda who kind of adopts the two of them and shares the memories of the wonderful married life he had with his late wife. Flashbacks give us big clues as to why these people were so right for each other and in his youth Alda is played by Jack Huston, grandson of John Huston and Oona Chaplin who has both Charlie Chaplin and Eugene O&apos;Neill in her pedigree is his wife who was a refugee from the Nazis. For that matter Alan Alda is the son of Robert Alda speaking of nepotism.\n\nAlda is really the one stealing the show here. As appealing and romantic as young Eastwood and Robertson are, Alda gives a really great performance and his introductory narrations really give flashback sequences some real poignancy. I hope there&apos;s some Oscar consideration for Alda in the Supporting Actor category.\n\nOf course it all works out for the young people as you knew it would. But for it to happen young Eastwood hits the equivalent of a big lottery ticket. And I&apos;m not talking about the PBR Las Vegas finals either.\n\nFor romantics of all ages is The Longest Ride.",

      "reviewBody": "So what could I add to what has been stated in the other reviews? Yes, &apos;Enter the Void&apos; is definitely a trippy mindbuster, and as such anyone who requires story or frames to enjoy a film should give it a miss. Yes, the visuals are eye-popping and the ubiquitous stroboscope effects may cause severe nausea - I watched it on BR and couldn&apos;t help but thinking what an advantage home entertainment can be over cinema exposure. This is a film which may be best enjoyed alone, somewhat stoned or drunk, and very late at night. And the pause button is definitely a life-saver.\n\nI can sympathize with those who felt tormented by the epic runtime and disparity between the first and second half of the film: the former is sort of a &apos;last film&apos; of the protagonist Victor retelling his life, and therefore makes sense plot-wise, the latter is a meandering flow representing his attachment to his sister. It is a bit unfair to discard the film for this reason, though, because the dialogue between Victor and his best friend Alex in the beginning hints at what the nature and culmination of this attachment will be. The interspersed aerial shots of an increasingly CG-rendered Tokyo may actually put this transition into question - this could all very well be part of Victor&apos;s &apos;death trip&apos;.\n\nWhat I really liked about &apos;Enter the Void&apos; is the setting, for I have lived in Tokyo myself for three years. The area where the story takes place (judging from where the CG puts the Tokyo Tower) should be Roppongi, which is an expat and night club haven; while the CG makes the place appear a bit gaudy, it is indeed populated by a disproportionate number of drop-outs and sleazy bees, and I&apos;ve always wondered why there&apos;s no film about Roppongi yet - contemporary Tokyo is mostly condensed to the Yakuza backdrop of Kabukichô or the juvenile epicenter of Shibuya. So on that note, I appreciate a film about the expat world, as weird and dysfunctional as it may be.\n\n&apos;Enter the Void&apos; pushes the gates of what film can visually do visually wide open, and therefore shouldn&apos;t be dismissed by any cinephile. But your viewing conditions will be crucial to whether you will love this film or hate it.",

      "reviewBody": "The New World \n\nreviewed by Sam Osborn rating: 3.5 out of 4 \n\nFiling out of The New World, completely speechless and without notes, I could fathom only single adjectives to describe the experience. Looking at these listed words on my memo-pad now, they read &quot;Thunderous, True, Beautiful, Solemn, Forceful, Gripping, Honest, and Slow.&quot; And for those who watch The New World with a calm countenance, an open mind and a ready cache of patience, Terrence Malick&apos;s long-awaited picture will have a similar effect. The film is a masterpiece thirty years in the making. \n\nHis goal is plain enough: to affectively and honestly portray the love Pocahontas experienced in those first years that Europeans cut their first, fresh swath from the New World. But Malick goes far beyond a simplistic love story. I was at the screening for Casanova a few days earlier, where the film&apos;s objective was essentially the same: to portray the love between Casanova and Francesca in the days of Inquisition Venice. But where Casanova approaches love at a bubbly, comedic perspective, The New World throws itself into a headlong narration of love&apos;s sorrow. Every frame of The New World reflects this painful, aching emotion, utilizing the sounds and images of environment to incredible, innovative effect. The first shot of the film--an extended shot several minutes in length--finds the camera staring into a river. It&apos;s clear and pristine, carefree and surrounded by the blissful sounds of an unperturbed forest. Soon ripples begin forming, and we notice the quiet droplets of rain pit-pattering around us, causing the water to flow a little, bringing about a contented onslaught of lily pedals. The scene continues on, drawing us farther and farther into Malick&apos;s deafening reality with only the sounds and images of nature. He creates a calm within us with these images, a kind of serene canvas for him to later paint the vivid brush-strokes of human love later in the film. In this entire first act, little is even said. But these scenes rarely grow tiring. He finds rich beauty with every situation. His forest is lush and his settlements picturesquely Dickensian. Malick shows great and rare confidence with this picture. Few filmmakers would have the cool audacity to create a film so primarily reliant on nothing being said. \n\nThe first and most important of Pocahontas&apos; (Q&apos;Orianka Kilcher) romances is with the infamous John Smith (Colin Farrell). He&apos;s brought to the New World bound in a cage, punished for earlier mutiny. But because he&apos;s the only soldier of the expedition, Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) opts to let him free on a strict probation. Their first encounters with the Naturals, as they&apos;re called, go coolly enough, with curious interest from the Naturals and tense hesitation from the settlers. And even here Malick plays with flights of romantic whimsy. These scenes of first encounter are shot in windswept, overgrown grassy fields, with Pocahontas dancing and twirling about them with her brother, catching the spry interest of Smith.\n\nSoon the settlers hear of a great city of Naturals down the river, and Smith is sent to investigate. Things have been going badly for the settlers and Captain Newport has left back for London and a new store of food and supplies. Smith&apos;s expedition is cut short, however, when he runs into a narrow, maze-like complex of swamps and is ambushed by warrior Naturals. He&apos;s taken prisoner by the Naturals, but granted life because of Pocahontas&apos; curious interest and her favoritism with Chief Powhatan (August Schellenberg). This catalyzes our entrance into The New World&apos;s most prominent territory. The scenes of Smith&apos;s time with the Naturals are Malick&apos;s best. They&apos;re those first strokes of paint on his canvas and the seeds of that palpable, historical romance.\n\nBut admittedly, even with The New World&apos;s supreme sense of confidence and slow-moving progression, it sometimes wanders into the realm of self-indulgence. It especially grows tiresome in the final act, when we&apos;re brought from Virginia to London, our beloved Smith left behind to be replaced by John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and his stonewall courting of Pocahontas. I&apos;d even venture to say that Malick could have left 30 minutes of these segments on the editing room floor, re-attaching them later to the Extended Cut DVD release that&apos;s sure to come. But movie-going patience is the mantra of the Awards season, and so some bottom-dragging in films is what&apos;s to be expected.\n\nWhat was not to be expected, however, was Q&apos;Orianka Kilcher, the debuting actress playing Pocahontas. Few words she says, but dialogue is not always what makes a forceful performance. Her body language and expressions are allowed to do the speaking for her. She&apos;s advantaged also by her strong, muscular features that often betray hints of divine femininity. Farrell also does well, particularly in his somber narration. He reads it as though he speaks the words to himself, whispering them almost, for only his imagination to hear. But his physicality is manipulated nicely as well, exuding bubbly chemistry for Kilcher. The two mix ideally. Their sorrow and love and deeply resonated emotions are echoed about with their strong performances and Malick&apos;s supreme direction. And although Christian Bale strides into picture in the latter parts of the film, our hearts lie with Smith and Pocahontas, and we find ourselves resentful of Rolfe&apos;s advances. But this is just Malick&apos;s narrative trickery. We find ourselves raggedly torn between these two equally honorable men, and put almost into the same position as Pocahontas. It&apos;s precisely the reason we go to the movies. We&apos;ve let the director take his grip on us and lead us down the path into characters and identities of his own creation. And with Malick leading our way, and with characters as tastefully dimensional as these, movie-going becomes a deep artistic pleasure.",

Sure it&apos;s pretty unbelievable but so are most movies out there.  Also, the film has a solid car chase scene at the end which is a solid way to end a fine film.  The opening heist scene is also pretty good as well, a good way to start the film.  Also the shootout at the grocery store is very funny, as well as several other scene&apos;s.  Highly Recommended,  for anyone who likes action-comedies.  4/5",

      "reviewBody": "Sorry to Bother You is a strange, surreal, hilarious satire guided by the intentionally unsteady hand of rapper-activist turned debut director, Boots Riley. \n\nIt dabbles in commentary on media, society, race and working-class issues-so many poignant messages, some more successfully delivered than others. The fearless absurdism will likely distract some viewers from a couple of these messages, but I&apos;m okay with that. I take this wonderful creation much more for its entertainment value than anything else. \n\nThe messages that do resonate should come through clearly. Riley&apos;s story doesn&apos;t shroud itself in murky metaphors. It tells us exactly how to interpret the bizarre world he has created. \n\nRising star LaKeith Stanfield plays Cassius &apos;Cash&apos; Green, a deep-thinker who lives in his uncle&apos;s garage with his artistic girlfriend named Detroit (the invaluable Tessa Thompson). It comes as no surprise that a man who goes by Boots would opt to give his characters unusual names. These two are just the beginning. \n\nTo collect enough scratch to keep up with his rent and put gas in the rusty bucket he drives, he takes a job as a telemarketer. When a wise elder advises him to use &quot;white voice&quot; to improve his sales, Cash starts to rake in the green. \n\nAfter he rises the ranks of the telemarketing world, ascending to the divine status of power caller, he attracts the attention of an eccentric, drug-fueled CEO, Steve Lift (Armie Hammer). His company, WorryFree (a place where employees feel anything but) hides a dark new idea. But when the secret leaks to the public, his stock unexpectedly skyrockets, and Lift is declared a pioneering genius. \n\nThe rational-minded public undoubtedly opposed Lift&apos;s plan, but big business carried on. As union organizer Squeeze (Steve Yuen) explains to Cassius, &quot;if you show people a problem, but they don&apos;t know what to do about it, they just learn to get used to it.&quot; \n\nIf you think you have any of this plot figured out, think again. It makes a radical left turn in the third act that will tempt some viewers to jump ship. My advice: stay on board. Even if you don&apos;t want to totally buy in, just hang around to see where this new direction leads. \n\nThe film flies along with such easy energy early, then hits turbulence when trying to figure out how to end this thing. Riley introduces so much psychedelic madness that by the end it&apos;s nearly impossible to wrap up the story. But at some point, one must come down from every trip. \n\nEven with as jarringly fantastical as it is, in many ways this movie also feels incredibly real. As Riley puts it, he strives to &quot;break down reality to help us better understand it.&quot; Mission accomplished.",

      "reviewBody": "Despite the mixed/average reviews, decided to see &apos;Beautiful Creatures&apos; anyway as someone who did enjoy the book series, liked the idea of the story, enjoys films that fit under the same genres that this does and who really likes to loves a lot of the cast members in other things. Other than the reviews, what did make me a little nervous too was the constant references by many to the &apos;Twilight&apos; franchise, am very much indifferent to that franchise to put it lightly and the best film from it (&apos;Eclipse&apos;) is only slightly watchable.\n\nWill get the comparisons out of the way. &apos;Beautiful Creatures&apos; is in my mind much better than any of the &apos;Twilight&apos; films combined, better made, much better acting (the &apos;Twilight&apos; films only had like two good actors, whereas even with the accents the acting mostly wasn&apos;t an issue for me here) and the story, for all its problems, interested me more. &apos;Beautiful Creatures&apos; is by no means perfect and would hesitate in calling it great, only generally found it slightly above average, but judging it as a film on its own merits (rather than frequently comparing it to the books, of which the film is a pretty poor adaptation of) it&apos;s a better film than given credit for.\n\nStarting with the bad things, &apos;Beautiful Creatures&apos; would have leant itself better to a film series rather than just one film, because there is a feel (and it was what was pretty much happening) of elements of two or more books in one film, which made it feel rushed and cluttered. The caster mythology could have been delved into much more, because that did tend to be convoluted (anybody who has no knowledge of the books may find themselves lost). Particularly towards the end, before the film ends in a vague and rushed way complete with a clumsy twist, it is not a surprise that book fans found the ending too much of a slap in the face.\n\nAlso found some of the earlier portions of &apos;Beautiful Creatures&apos; to be too exposition heavy, with some clunky dialogue and the pace in need of a tightening up. The Lena&apos;s first day at school portion was very badly acted by the secondary cast, was really cringing, and written in a very bad teen school comedy film way. It has been said numerous times about the Southern accents being bad, do agree with it veering on either extreme of come and go (Jeremy Irons, accents never really has been his forte and this is coming from a fan of his) and exaggerated (Alden Ehrenreich) of the main cast. And it&apos;s even worse for the secondary cast playing characters that are very broadly stereotypical, that is true of a lot of Southerner portrayals on film, and never feel like real people.\n\nConversely, &apos;Beautiful Creatures&apos; is a surprisingly good looking film, it was clear a lot of time, effort and money went into it. Especially loved the locations, with a big standout going to the Ravenwood mansion and the photography is both beautiful and gothic. The costumes are also ni nicely done, the kookiness of those of the Ravenwoods (including Eileen Atkins with a pink wig!) added to their mysteriousness, and the dinner table scene sees some editing and lighting that are wonderfully psychedelic without giving me too much headache or dizziness. The music fits quite nicely too and was hardly unattractive to me on its own, am big on both those things when it comes to music in film so both are good positions to be in.\n\nThe script is flawed early on but as the film progressed the snappier, more intriguing and tighter it became. Macon, with the film livening up by quite a bit when he appears, has some of the best lines and that&apos;s in his first scene alone. The story isn&apos;t perfect, but enough of it does compel with two scenes in particular standing out. One was the dinner table scene, along with Ridley&apos;s flashback that was the most striking scene visually, and the other was the Macon and Sarafine confrontation, the chemistry between Irons and Emma Thompson sizzles and seeing a clash of the titans-like moments between two great actors is always great to watch. The likeably natural, no awkwardness here (actually did get the sense that they were in love), chemistry between Ehrenreich and Alice Englert also helps as does the confident direction.\n\nFound Ehrenreich and Englert to mostly not be bad at all in their roles, Ehrenreich&apos;s accent is not the best and he overdoes it at times but the quirkiness and likeability is there. While Englert is more subtle without being sullen or expressionless, did root for Lena myself having been treated like an outcast in school for prejudicial reasons too. They are very well supported, outshone even, by the veteran cast, with Atkins and Martina Martindale doing a lot with small roles and Viola Davis bringing sincerity to hers. The authors had Irons in mind when writing Macon and one can tell because not so good accent aside he was made for the character, and he looked like he was having fun while bringing gravitas and menace. Thompson even more so, camping it up deliciously and nearly stealing the film, and the same goes for a truly delightful Emmy Rossum.\n\nSummarising, not quite beautiful but far from ugly. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "If you can accept the totally ridiculous premise of KATE AND LEOPOLD and enjoy romantic fantasies of this sort, you&apos;ll find yourself drawn into the plot because of the very charismatic HUGH JACKMAN. He is the main reason for watching and carries the film on his sturdy shoulders, so adept is he at being a &quot;knight in shining armor&quot;.\n\nAs for MEG RYAN, she is giving her usual Meg Ryan schtick--a sort of slightly brighter version of Goldie Hawn--but here it doesn&apos;t matter because Jackman manages to steal every scene he&apos;s in.  BRECKIN MEYER is excellent as her boorish brother who learns a few things from his 18th Century friend about manners and etiquette. But it&apos;s the time travel aspect of the story that is its weakest link.\n\nHighly recommended as a romantic comedy that owes much of its charm to the performance of its leading man--an actor of remarkable skill whose hunky presence dominates much of the movie.\n\nIt&apos;s the sort of romantic fluff that would have starred JEAN ARTHUR and GARY COOPER had it been made in the &apos;30s. The New York location photography is excellent."

Some have called the film, Woody Allen&apos;s worst film, and I simply don&apos;t agree. (His worse film is Scoop) The whole cast works nicely and all the performances are all around great. My favorite being Judy Davis, she stole the show for me. \n\nI found some of the scenes rushed and haphazardly constructed and some of the dialogue overwritten and under-rehearsed. The film at times, felt very lazy and a bit fake, at times. At 112 Mimutes, To Rome with Love is a good 20 minutes longer than most Woody Allen films, and it shows. The movie was overlong and a bit boring at times. There weren&apos;t enough charming and funny scenes to compensate for it&apos;s running time. Some scenes should&apos;ve definitely been cut. Woody Allen&apos;s latest effort is flawed, but definitely not a bad film, as most are saying. \n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "This may get a little personal, but I&apos;ve been suffering from severe depression and have had a lot of issues dealing with anger, sadness and all for about five years now. For the past 8 years of my life, and earlier years of my childhood, I have loved Fred Rogers. He always told me and millions of children all over the world that he likes us just the way we are, and taught us the power of kindness, positive ways of thinking and dealing with our emotions, and while I&apos;ll always be a cynic by nature, I&apos;ve always tried to take what he taught me and many others to heart. He was genuinely the kindest, most loving and compassionate human being to ever grace this Earth. But over the past year especially, I&apos;ve stopped caring about my life with tragedy happening around me constantly, making me feel like my life was falling apart, as well as me having thoughts of suicide. I always put Mr Rogers on to give me some kind of motivation to keep going, but his messages that once resonated so deeply with me began to fade as I slipped further and further away from being &quot;fine&quot;. I&apos;ve gotten a lot better over the past few months though, not perfect but still, and when I heard that a movie starring Tom Hanks as Mr Rogers was being made I did all that I could to see it as fast as possible when it finally came out in the UK (which as of writing this, was yesterday).\n\nThe second this film started, the moment Hanks appeared and the music came on, I just completely melted. I almost audibly broke down into tears, but not with sadness, with joy and relief. I knew I was in for something that would grip me. This film is amazing. It focuses on the psychological healing and betterment of the protagonist, Lloyd, as Mr Rogers taps into his childhood and his feelings, the same way he tapped into the feelings of children back when his show was still on the air and back when I watched it a decade ago, and we get a powerful, touching tribute to this man and the impact he had on so many lives. Lloyd himself was not only well acted, but for me anyway I saw a bit of myself in him. Things like his strained relations with family, his overwhelming and blinding cynicism and his anger management are all things I dealt with at some point and still deal with today. So when the film took this character and and put him on this emotional journey to betterment and healing, it resonated so deeply with me that I began to feel as if I was a kid again, watching Rogers as he taught me how to deal with my own anger and to prioritise kindness, and for many people who saw this film, I feel like they experienced the same thing I did. And that&apos;s why this movie is so good. It has the same impact and kind-heartedness as Rogers&apos; original show, but turned into an emotional, thoughtful and touching feature-length film that acts as the perfect tribute to Fred&apos;s legacy and life. At the end of the day though, the film, while an amazing tribute to Fred, isn&apos;t entirely about him. It&apos;s about how he saved the life of Lloyd, became one of his closest friends, and helped him heal his psychological wounds. And the perfect way to put this film is this: It&apos;s a film that celebrates the messages, kindness and life of Mr Rogers, that acts as a way to show the impact that he had on so many lives, and despite him not being in the film as much as Lloyd, who is the main protagonist of the film, his impact is felt throughout its entire runtime and in every single scene.\n\nOther things as well, the blending of the old Mr Rogers sets with locations in the film was very creative and touching, the acting, especially from Hanks was incredible, the film was perfectly paced and while the score isn&apos;t anything to talk about, the parts that do use music are done very well and capture the feel of the scene. The editing might&apos;ve been a little iffy at points, but that was mainly at the beginning of the film. Overall, it&apos;s probably my favourite movie of 2019, even if I did have to wait until 2020 to watch it. If you have not watched it yet, please do. It&apos;s absolutely phenomenal.",

I think that my favorite character would have to have been Kit, who is the roommate of Sarah Jessica Parkers character. I think that perhaps the main characters did not have the most humorous lines as their costars did, but each star mixed well in the movie. I think that if you are one of those people who like to watch girly movies, as I am, then you would definitely enjoy it.",

      "reviewBody": "The mechanics of the movie have been well-reviewed by others.  Yes, it could definitely have been a better movie, but then again what movie can&apos;t you say that about?  In terms of plot and character development what it needed most was another 30 minutes, but at two and a quarter hours already most studios would never allow that.  (Note that the movie did not seem nearly that long to me.) Perhaps the plot and story could have been tighter, but it&apos;s really a remarkable job for first-time screenwriter Mike Rich.\n\nThe acting, while not always remarkable, was quite good.  Connery brilliantly underplayed Forrester, yielding a less dramatic but much more realistic portrayal of the writer.  Rob Brown&apos;s portrayal of Jamal was equally reserved yet forceful.  The directing held the two characters in balance well.  The other characters were well-acted though not generally well-developed (hence much criticism of this movie).\n\nOthers have compared Finding Forrester to Goodwill Hunting (also directed by Gus Van Sant) and to Scent of a Woman, suggesting that it is just a ripoff of the plot in those two.  If so (which I doubt), those are two pretty good movies to plagiarize.  The basic concept of Forrester&apos;s story (first novel wins Pulitzer -- what do you do for an encore?) has also been done before, but I&apos;ve never seen it done so well (and without resorting to The Bottle as an excuse for a wasted life).\n\nWhat&apos;s been missed in the reviews I checked was a discussion of who found whom.  When you boil it down, Jamal found Jamal and Forrester found Forrester (just in time), though they found themselves by reaching out to each other and forming a bond of friendship across a gulf of age, suspicion, and race.  The way they do this, without the usual twists of self-destruction and miraculous salvation, is both touching and refreshingly real.  And finding oneself, in its essence, is what EVERY good drama is about, so, yes, there is a similarity to Goodwill and Scent and every other good movie ever made.\n\nIncluded in the movie is a very brief first course in writing.  Though the movie doesn&apos;t dwell on it, the way it presents the process of writing (and of the criticism of writing) is refreshingly realistic.\n\nSpeculation about the &quot;real&quot; identity of Forrester is interesting.  Salinger has been mentioned, but the similarities are only superficial.  Harper Lee (To Kill a Mockingbird) is a much better fit (first novel wins Pulitzer, nothing else ever written, lived as a recluse), but I almost favor the enigmatic Gardner McKay (though Forrester is certainly different in many ways from McKay).  However, it&apos;s just as likely that Rich had no particular person in mind when he crafted Forrester (since, after all, the First Novel Syndrome is a well known plot theme).\n\nAll in all, while not The Great American Movie, it&apos;s a very good movie and well worth watching."

Comedy is a very relative, personal thing. What someone finds funny, someone else would not. I have strange taste in comedy. I like physical, silly comedies, but also intelligent satire, I&apos;m kind of all over the map when it comes to what makes me laugh. This one, about a software company on the brink of failure, was pretty good. I laughed several times. It was a little long for a comedy, I feel they could have edited some scenes better. Two hours is too long for most movies, especially a comedy. I liked most of the characters and thought they did well with the script they were given. It&apos;s not rocket science, but it was entertaining and I&apos;m glad she rented it.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of Scorsese&apos;s lesser known films which is a travesty. Griffin Dunne plays a cubicle working blue collar- the type that was so rampant in the mid 80s, who accidently experiences a series of bizarre misadventures in New York City. This is not typical Scorsese fare and one reason it works is because of the legendary filmmaker&apos;s deft skills- the atmosphere is amazing as is the pacing of the film. The protagonist is relatable in an everyman lost and confused kind of way. Like a bad dream or surreal experience After Hours is one hell of a ride. As stated in the opening line of this review- it is a travesty that more people aren&apos;t aware of this film."

She is a rarity in modern film, a good looking actress who shows not the slightest hesitation at going all JCVD on someone&apos;s butt if the script demands it.\n\nAnd she is good. I mean there are multiple scenes here where she carries the attention of the viewer and it is hard to imagine another actress doing that as well.\n\nThe unfortunate part is that it seems no one in Hollywood wanted to accept the challenge of moving her career along even though it deserved to be moved. I watched her in IN THE BLOOD, a later effort framed as a B movie and lacking all the class and polish in this one.\n\nToo bad. I miss her already.",

      "name": "A decent blockbuster from Ron Howard",
      "reviewBody": "Ron Howard&apos;s &quot;Backdraft&quot; is a true blockbuster in the 90&apos;s mold. Star-studded and full of spectacle, it did good business in 1991 while garnering mildly positive reviews. It was apparently remembered fondly enough to warrant a straight-to-video sequel earlier this year which, to it&apos;s credit, at least brought back William Baldwin &amp; Donald Sutherland.\n\nAs for the original movie, the story is set in Chicago and it focuses on a pair of firefighting brothers (Kurt Russell &amp; William Baldwin). The older brother is a seasoned vet while the younger brother is a rookie who has previously tried and failed at other professions. The two butt heads repeatedly as they work towards bringing an arsonist to justice.\n\nThere&apos;s plenty of action here but also a strong mystery angle as well. This provides a welcome change of pace when it kicks in about an hour into the movie. Generally, the script is pretty overwrought most of the time with the story often veering into melodrama and action movie clichés. However, the plot is fairly satisfying in the end, with a twist that&apos;s better executed than most.\n\nArguably the movie&apos;s biggest asset is its nicely assembled cast. Aside from Russell &amp; Baldwin as the aforementioned brothers, a critical role belongs to Robert De Niro as an arson investigator. He unsurprisingly delivered the movie&apos;s best performance, despite the role being fairly limited. Donald Sutherland also makes a memorable appearance as an incarcerated pyromaniac. Other notable supporting players include Scott Glenn, Rebecca De Mornay, Jennifer Jason Leigh &amp; the always dependable character actor J.T. Walsh. As for Russell &amp; Baldwin, I wouldn&apos;t call this one of my favourite Kurt Russell roles but William Baldwin was surprisingly capable, considering that his career never really developed like his older brother Alec&apos;s.\n\nThe other strong point of the movie is the visual effects and stunt work. It must have been an insurance nightmare to achieve these kinds of visuals in the days before widespread CGI. There&apos;s no substitute for the real thing when dealing with fire, so the results speak for themselves. The movie justifiably landed a few Oscar nominations for both its visual effects and sound, which demonstrates the expertise that went into the technical aspects of the production. Overall, Ron Howard&apos;s direction is quite capable with a mix of dramatic scenes and multiple action setpieces. I will say, though, that the bookending songs by Bruce Hornsby &amp; the Range haven&apos;t aged too well in my opinion. They&apos;re no &quot;The Way It Is&quot;, that&apos;s for sure.\n\nIn the end, &quot;Backdraft&quot; is a bit overblown at 2 hours and 17 minutes. The producers were probably aiming for something a bit more intimate than &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; but they ended up falling into some of the same traps anyway. So, I wouldn&apos;t count this among Howard&apos;s best but it&apos;s still worth watching, particularly given relatively small number of worthwhile firefighter movies.",

      "name": "Horribly underrated",
      "reviewBody": "In 1999, the media was in a frenzy about a new film that used real things to terrify and excite its audience. Stir Of Echoes was not it. Partly due to the studio&apos;s financial difficulties, Stir Of Echoes came and went by itself, unsung and unappreciated. Which goes to show that recognition in the Hollywood system does not go to innovators or the best storytellers. It is all about marketability, and while Stir Of Echoes had this, the companies involved in making or distributing it did not seem to want to spend the cash involved in taking advantage. Either that or Artisan and Fox decided to use it as their tax write-off for that year.\n\nI have not read the novel by Richard Matheson, so I cannot comment on how faithfully the film follows its source. But that is irrelevant. When compared to its more big-name competitor, at least Stir Of Echoes has the courtesy to acknowledge its source. The film updates the story to a more modern era, thus saving a few dollars, since period pieces are expensive to make. In fact, the dramatic angle of the film keeps it rather cheap, since effects shots are few and far between. Not to mention the effects that do appear are fairly simple in nature. Indeed, Stir Of Echoes only cost about thirteen million to make, according to estimates. Which makes it all the more peculiar that Fox was unwilling to invest a little more effort in publicising the film.\n\nKevin Bacon is in fine, fine form as the film&apos;s central hero, a regular guy called Tom Witzky. Kathryn Erbe is also in great form as his wife, Maggie. Illeana Douglas is decidedly odd as his sister-in-law, Lisa. But the real surprise here is child performer Zachary David Cope. After the pretender, that pile of sachaarine garbage called The Sixth Sense, child stars had such a bad reputation that Zachary deserves a medal for portraying such a genuinely likable, layered character. Indeed, director David Koepp took one hell of a risk by placing so much of the responsibility for the plot on his shoulders. That it pays off is a testament not only to the strength of Zachary David Cope&apos;s performance, but to the strength of the material he was given. Indeed, all the best scenes in Stir Of Echoes involve interaction between Zachary, Kathryn, and Kevin.\n\nI do think this film has its faults. Chief among them is that the story needed another ten minutes to properly develop. Plot threads like the group of psychics, a member of which helps put Kathryn Erbe&apos;s character on the path of greater understanding, needed better resolution. One moment, Maggie is asking this policeman why her husband is obsessed with a scene of memories to the exclusion of his job. The next moment, not only are details like the job forgotten, so too is the group and the policeman. Smoothing out intricate plot points such as this would have helped the story no end.\n\nIn the end, however, Stir Of Echoes is proof that the artistic work one does not hear about may just be the one that has more merit. If nothing else, it is worth watching to see a small ensemble cast that excels. Even small performances like Liza Weil&apos;s demonstrate a sense of dramatic flair that has long fled most of the rest of Hollywood. It is for this reason that I gave Stir Of Echoes an eight out of ten. It is worth watching just to see how badly misdirected the hype machine often is.",

      "reviewBody": "As has been stated many times already, Ned (Paul Rudd) is not an idiot. Well, he kind of is. He lacks understanding of normal social protocol, and not in a genius kind-of-way, but as a hippie. Prone to frequent breakdowns in communication, one such instance lands him in jail. When he&apos;s out, he&apos;s off to live with his family. His sisters all treat him like he&apos;s an idiot. Hence, the title, &quot;Our Idiot Brother.&quot; \n\nNed is a good and caring guy. His sisters are completely different and completely different from each other — one is even British. In their own way, they are all selfish, demanding and insensitive people. But don&apos;t worry, Ned is our hero and protagonist. If you are currently sighing in relief, I understand. A career spanning two decades with 30-plus movie credits, and we&apos;ve only seen Paul Rudd in the lead role a handful of times.\n\nRudd has infused Ned with all the charm, likability and overall appeal that we have come to expect from him. Surprisingly, the less likable actresses playing the three unlikable sisters were at least able to add some humour to their characters. The three supporting actors probably could have stolen the show if they were given more time: Steve Coogan as the husband with a penchant for exhibitionism; Hugh Dancy as a creepy artist turned cultist; and Adam Scott as Rudd&apos;s long lost brother — not literally, he just has the same presence.\n\n&quot;Our Idiot Brother&quot; is a comedy, one of those heart-warming comedies, where all of the characters start coming around to see the value of having Ned in their life. It takes them longer than us to realize his positive aspects because most of them are not fully-developed characters, especially the mother, I&apos;m not sure what the point of her was.\n\nUnfortunately, it&apos;s not a particularly funny comedy, but it is a likable one. A few ill-fated groin jokes would have been better off in a different movie, and a few jokes lost their humour after they appeared in the trailer, and after that there&apos;s only a few left to discover. It is funny, but not as funny as you would expect a comedy to be. But did I mention likable? Because that&apos;s what &quot;Our Idiot Brother&quot; is: sweet, charming and overall appealing.",

He plays a non-hero, an unassuming regular guy who can&apos;t meet a girl, or do anything except drive, who gets sucked into a ridiculous situation.\n\nCompletely unbelievable and ridiculous. Not great cinema. All action movies are that way; this is funny because of the low-key irony.\n\nEven Jennifer Love Hewitt seems deliberately miscast, but hilarious as she vacillates between superintelligent nerd, ditz, valley girl and superheroine.\n\nWe prefer this to Austin Powers with its completely over-the-top, zero subtlety. Here the sexual innuendo would not be missed by a teenager, but would go right over the head of kids, making it a film any age could enjoy. But you have to want to laugh, not critique.",

More fundamentally, the concept of Analyse This hasn&apos;t been taken any further. There could be some entertainment to be had when Robert de Niro&apos;s character takes a job as an advisor on `Little Caesar&apos;, a Mafia-themed TV drama, but the main joke is that the actor playing the Don is an Australian. It struck me that both actors who played Don Corleone in The Godfather series have now taken the mickey out of the mafia  Brando in The Freshman and now de Niro in the Analyse This and That series (if there&apos;s a sequel, what will it be called? Analyse The Other?)\n\n Lisa Kudrow is grossly underused  one gets the feeling that much of her part ended up on the cutting room floor. Both Crystal and de Niro are pretty good (this is called `damning with faint praise&apos; in the trade, if you&apos;re wondering) There are some pleasing shots of New York, and David Holmes&apos; soundtrack has its moments (although is nothing to his work for Ocean&apos;s Eleven or Out of Sight) Analyse That is not a bad film, just a rather forgettable one. Puts the `sleep&apos; into `sleeps with the fishes.&apos;"

      "reviewBody": "So help me, I found Cop Out to be not completely bad. Yes, that&apos;s a backhanded compliment, but I assure you that it&apos;s completely deserved. Cop Out, from its inane title to its derivative plot, has no business being anything but a hokey hoedown of banal buddy cop dopey behavior. And yet&apos;s it&apos;s not as gut-wrenchingly awful as all that.\n\nCop Out stars Bruce Willis and Tracey Morgan as veteran police partners on the trail of a gangbanger (Guillermo Diaz) who loves baseball memorabilia and who just happened to steal Willis&apos; super-valuable baseball card, the one he was going to have to sell to finance his daughter&apos;s wedding; better to do that than have his wife&apos;s new, rich husband pay for it all.\n\nBut that cop-movie aspect is almost irrelevant. What matters, and the only thing that really puts this one in the same general universe as the likes of, say, Lethal Weapon (in terms of approach, not overall quality), is the thrust-and-parry repartee between straight-arrow Willis (a 180 from his John McClane character/caricature) and loose-cannon, uber-hip Morgan. They&apos;re funny together, and they&apos;re given funny things to say in funny situations. That helps a lot.\n\nWhat&apos;s puzzling about this movie is that Kevin Smith directed it, the first of his that he didn&apos;t also write. That&apos;s puzzling because the dialog isn&apos;t really this movie&apos;s strong point. If I hadn&apos;t seen Smith&apos;s name attached to this in writing, I&apos;d never have guessed he had had a hand in it.\n\nBut ultimately, it doesn&apos;t matter much, as it&apos;s just plain not terrible. You can tell I&apos;m trying not to go overboard in my hyperbole, right? I want to present you with a level-headed, even-handed look at whether this is worth your time. And it is, with lowered expectations. It&apos;s amusing, although not for the whole family to watch.",

      "name": "A sentimental film about things seemingly not",
      "reviewBody": "There are numerous directions Clint Eastwood and screenwriter John Lee Hancock could&apos;ve taken in his film, A Perfect World, and the one he sucks up and follows is a brave, endearing roller-coaster of emotion, sentiment, and commentary all providing slick and clean moments robbed of mawkish sequences. This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself, cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both.\n\nA Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved, saddening family of devout Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses. Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) is a young boy, victim to not having birthdays, holidays, or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother&apos;s preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house, Kevin Costner&apos;s &quot;Butch&quot; Haynes takes the kid as a hostage, and Butch&apos;s loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem.\n\nWhen he is finally abandoned long after the robbery, Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could&apos;ve imagined. Butch&apos;s dad was never around, and his mother was a prostitute, accompanied by men they couldn&apos;t care less about him. Phillip&apos;s dad is a simple deadbeat, never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I&apos;m blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine.\n\nIt&apos;s big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher; growing up with no mother, or no father. Without a father, you don&apos;t get the &quot;time to be a man&quot; talk, you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone, and this leads to the lack of parental supervision, causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother, you&apos;ve lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of, maybe, truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so, but answer me this; when children cry, do they want mommy or daddy? I&apos;ve trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood&apos;s Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit, destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper, but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention, it isn&apos;t as intrusive or as dopey as it seems. It&apos;s actually taken with a lot of seriousness and heart.\n\nPerformance-wise, the film is around the clock superb. Much acclaim is due to Costner&apos;s character, who is serenely nuanced enough to make a true, memorable character. He has an outer-layer of cruelty but an inner layer of gooey anti-cynicism which comes forth very quickly. T.J. Lowther is spunky and charismatic as little Phillip, and Eastwood, do I even need to say it? Is incredible.\n\nA Perfect World may extend a bit over the recommended time limit, but few, few spots are dry, the script is always attentive, and the casting and directing style of Eastwood is fitting and balanced. This is probably Costner&apos;s most dedicated and engaging performances, yet due to the moderate box office receipts and the minimal impact, it has likely made him reconsider serious roles. Same thing could possibly go for Robert De Niro. It&apos;s undoubtedly easier to immerse yourself into a character that is thin, vacuous, and dull than one that is developed, deep, and potential-ridden. Eastwood has made a sentimental gem of a picture, with topics that hit seemingly hit every note but.\n\nStarring: Kevin Costner, T.J. Lowther, and Clint Eastwood. Directed by: Clint Eastwood.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this before the brouhaha with Clinton and Lewinsky broke, and I imagine most of the negative comments about this film came because they saw it after and thought this was a Nostradamus film.  When I saw it, I thought it started a bit slow, and was a bit too self-satisfied (like the scenes of people crying at a concert; that seemed fake).  However, for most of the way, this is sharp, biting, and yes, funny, though when I first saw it, I thought it was more accurate in its Hollywood satire than on its government satire.  Time, of course, proved me wrong.\n\nDavid Mamet will never be universally loved, because not only does there seem to be a large group that doesn&apos;t get him, but that thinks those of us that like him are degenerates.  Myself, I happen to think he&apos;s one of the best playwrights and screenwriters working today (though I&apos;m split so far on his novels).  His writing may be highly stylized, but I guess I&apos;m in tune to the rhythms of his dialogue.  And he doesn&apos;t assume his audience is dumb; rather, he seeks to challenge them by asking you to come to your own conclusions, rather than hit you over the head.  And he does that very well in this movie; at the beginning, we may think Conrad Brean and Stanley Motss are real sleazebags, but at the end, while we deplore the action they take of faking a war just for political ends, we can&apos;t quite dismiss them either.\n\nOf course, a lot of that has to do with the performances of Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman (Anne Heche is also a standout as Winnifred Ames, the increasingly bemused presidential aide).  DeNiro seems at first like a teddy bear here, with his beard, his hat, and his bow tie, but he transfers the energy associated with his more volatile roles (TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS et al) to guile and street smarts here.  The way his eyes probe whoever he&apos;s talking to, and the way he anticipates almost every verbal comeback the other person has demonstrates that(he can&apos;t anticipate every event, of course, but once he gets used to it, he can).\n\nBut the standout here is Hoffman.  There&apos;s been a lot of comment on Hoffman basing his character on Robert Evans.  My own theory is he read Lynda Obst&apos;s excellent book HELLO, HE LIED, which talks about the producer&apos;s role, and simply played that.  I formed that theory because of his mantra whenever things go wrong, &quot;This is nothing!&quot;, especially when Winnifred reads him the riot act after their plane crashes.  There&apos;s a part in the book where Obst talks about having to argue budget with the studio, and realizes it&apos;s all a game where they have roles to play; she argues for more money, the studio for less.  Just as Winnifred&apos;s role is to be pessimistic, and Stanley&apos;s is to be optimistic.  And Hoffman never condescends to Stanley, instead showing a talented, maybe amoral guy who deep down is so insecure that he values credit even over his life(&quot;F*** my life, I want the credit!&quot; is one of the best lines of the film&quot;).  Contrary to his line, this film is not nothing.",

      "reviewBody": "Love needs expressions not language, it requires feelings no boundaries, it&apos;s beyond oceans beyond limits- Free and Beautiful but only few know how to live it. Barfi as its name is sweet, full of aroma, delicious and tasty. This in true sense expresses love without any language, caste, creed or color –Selfless with heart; an impeccable cinema worth watching with your beloved, friends and family.\n\nBarfi ! Essentially is a chapter of life which has numerable good moments to recall, laugh and to love with. Every character is well placed without being dramatic with excellent music, performances, direction and screenplay.\n\nAnurag Basu- the director has done extraordinary work in terms of narrating the story. Like &apos;Inception&apos; his narrative style takes you in flashback and a flashback within a flashback to narrate a simple story in its most impactful form without creating confusions to audience. Every story has been woven perfectly till climax. Despite the destiny of characters what audience recalls some beautiful moments, cheer, laughs, true love and sacrifice. Each and every prank on screen gives you a bucketful humor and feel good factor whether it&apos;s Barfi-cop chase or Barfi&apos;s effort to impress Jhilmil and Shruti throughout the movie.\n\nRanbir Kapoor- Well this guy has redefined himself, and the only commercial cinema star of recent time who knows how to act dances and laugh with perfection. Whether it was &apos;wake up sid&apos;, &apos;Raajneeti&apos;or &apos;Rockstar&apos; with every movie he has successfully set benchmark for himself but with this movie he has set benchmark even for so called Khans and Roshans. The beauty of his character is despite being deaf and dump in the movie not a single moment you will realize that he even require to speak. His expressions are heartwarming and simply outstanding. \n\nPriyanka Chopra – Luckily we have a pool of talented actress these days and Priyanka Chopra with this movie will give a tough challenge to her peers. Her expressions as an autism child are natural and clean. Her feelings for Ranbir as a lady could be easily readable and this is undoubtedly one of the best performances of her career.\n\nIleana D&apos;Cruz – She is one of the best debut of this year. Extremely good looking and charming, she never gives the feeling of a debutant. She does her job perfectly as a narrator and as an actor.\n\nBarfi is a way of life, it has potential to make you laugh without getting dirty, it has power to make you cry without getting dramatic and it has energy to teach you love for all without being a documentary. Barfi is perfect in all sense. And for those who could ask why I have written an inch away from Masterpiece ,well being a critique we always expect more than what we got but as soon as the wedding bells rings in the end it was obvious that Barfi has crossed that inch of perfection It&apos;s a Masterpiece of Indian Cinema.\n\nThanks &amp; Regards Yours AVA For Complete Review Please VISIT www.thecritiquelab.com Your Views are heartily welcome",

      "reviewBody": "Spanglish navigates between drama and comedy with a strong cast and moments that capture the complexity of human relationships. However, its narrative lacks a clear storyline, unfolding more like a mosaic of interactions and conflicts among its characters.\n\nThe story is narrated by Cristina, a 17-year-old girl, as a tender recollection of her mother, Flor. Through her Princeton admission essay, the film explores her family&apos;s immigration journey, adding layers of emotional manipulation to the narrative. Flor, who learns English to better connect with the family she works for, brings invaluable common sense to a household filled with chaos.\n\nDeborah (Téa Leoni), meanwhile, is a neurotic woman going through an identity crisis after losing her job as a commercial designer. While her behavior often crosses the line-like when she buys her daughter Bernice smaller-sized clothes to &quot;encourage&quot; her to lose weight-Leoni manages to make Deborah humanly endearing, even when she constantly oversteps boundaries. Her lack of consideration gives Flor an opportunity to shine with her intelligence, while Bernice and John (Adam Sandler) eloquently express their indignation, allowing the audience to draw its own conclusions.\n\nAdam Sandler delivers a surprisingly authentic performance as John, a chef hailed as the best in America by The New York Times. While one might expect his character to be a perfectionist tyrant with anger issues, John turns out to be a sweet and genuine man-reminiscent of the lovable characters Sandler is known for. His moments with his daughter Bernice, portrayed with freshness by Sarah Steele in her film debut, are heartfelt and stand out as some of the most memorable in the movie.\n\nThough Flor is endearing as a mother and central figure in the story, Paz Vega&apos;s character occasionally feels unreal in her reactions. Some of her decisions seem overly idealized, which detracts slightly from the credibility of her role in such an intimate and human context.\n\nDespite its gaps in plausibility, Spanglish remains compelling, mainly because of the emotional connection it fosters between its characters and the audience. While it&apos;s not always a cohesive story, its ability to depict the ups and downs of family life and cultural tensions makes it a worthwhile journey.",

      "reviewBody": "As a psychological thriller, or a horror film, &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; doesn&apos;t break new ground. In fact, once it&apos;s over, the viewer feels somehow manipulated by what we have just witnessed. There are, supposedly, four different alternative endings for the movie, but unfortunately, the one being shown, doesn&apos;t add anything to what we have already seen.\n\nAlthough the film has some interesting moments, director John Polson has gone for the Grand Guignol effect. Ari Schlosberg&apos;s screen play gives us hints about what to expect, yet, when we realize the mystery at the center of the story, we keep scratching our heads.\n\nSuffice it to say, this film doesn&apos;t add anything to Robert DeNiro&apos;s brilliant career. Mr. DeNiro&apos;s last choices in films puzzle us, as well as his fans because we know he is capable of doing much better. Yet, as shown with this film and &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;, and its sequel, &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot;, &quot;Analize This&quot;, and &quot;Analize That&quot;, the actor keeps us wondering about his choices.\n\nDakota Fanning is a young actress who shows an uncanny sense of how to upstage Mr. DeNiro in most of their scenes together. As Emily, in this film, this girl shows an enormous range in what she is capable of doing. One can see Ms. Fanning growing to be another Jody Foster in later years.\n\nThe rest of the cast is completely underused. Amy Irving is only seen in flashbacks, which is a shame since she is a valuable actress. Famke Janssen has a few key scenes. The same goes for Melissa Leo, Elisabeth Shue and Robert John Burke.\n\nThe only consolation was it was shown on cable and we felt lucky not having spent the price of admission.",

      "reviewBody": "Overblown, overdirected, overacted: that&apos;s why I always enjoy DePalma&apos;s movies.  He made the statement that the camera lies 24 times a second, and SNAKE EYES plays on that theme.\n\nDe Palma&apos;s camera is constantly in motion, roaming through the arena, casino , and hotel as if it had a life of its own.  At the beginning of the film we watch Nick Santoro (Nicolas Cage) as he swims through the sewer (his words) that is the Atlantic City casino world.  He tells us, &quot;This isn&apos;t a beach town.  It&apos;s a sewer.  It&apos;s my sewer, I am the king.&quot;\n\nIt&apos;s literally a dark and stormy night.  A hurricane (a tv reporter is pressured to refer to it as a &apos;tropical depression&apos; on the air) is coming ashore, and 14,000 people are gathered at a casino complex to watch a prizefight.\n\nThere&apos;s a shooting during the fight, and Cage orders the exits sealed; who would go outside into a hurricane remains a mystery, but anyhow.  There are two mysterious women involved in the incident, and as time passes he realizes that there were lots of people involved, possibly even his longtime friend Navy Commander Dunne (Gary Sinese) who is as straight-arrow as Cage&apos;s character is sleazy.\n\nBy the end of the story Cage is working toward redemption- even though during the early part of the film it&apos;s made clear that he sees everything as having a price.\n\nThere&apos;s one point where he is offered a million dollars to reveal where one of the women (she knows a lot- too much- about a defense contract, and was talking to the Secretary of Defense when he was shot) is hiding.  And there &apos;s a very real chance that he might give in, or be unable to protect her when the danger gets intense.\n\nMen in De Palma&apos;s films have a way of failing to come through for women in critical situations.  An executive couldn&apos;t save his wife in OBSESSION.  A young actor couldn&apos;t protect a mysterious, beautiful woman in BODY DOUBLE. The nicest guy in school couldn&apos;t keep the outcast/prom queen CARRIE from humiliation and its awful consequences.  In the superb BLOW OUT a movie soundman rescues a young woman from a sinking car early in the story, but is too late to save her from a madman at the film&apos;s conclusion.\n\nSo there is no guarantee of a happy ending.  Self doubt weighs heavily in De Palma&apos;s films, and often people&apos;s best efforts are to no avail.\n\nAdmittedly David Koepp and De Palma&apos;s script is something of a problem. There&apos;s a complex conspiracy underfoot, and conspiracies are low on my list of compelling things- I got burned out on them in the seventies.\n\nFar more compelling is the great fun that Cage has with his character.  Boy, does he get to chew scenery here.  Constantly in motion, talking on his cell phone (even during a hurricane; some of my friends can&apos;t use theirs when a cloud passes over the sun), interacting with the low life characters around the casino.\n\nAnd, oh, does DePalma have fun with the whole thing.  Of course, nothing is what it seems to be.  He retells the action from the viewpoint of this or that character: we sometimes literally see what happened through that character&apos;s eyes.  An important setpiece in which we finally see what really happened in clear perspective uses split screen imagery- and in the theatre where we saw SNAKE EYES the use of stereo sound was an integral part of the seperation of images.\n\nFor all the bravado of his performance, I was impressed with Cage&apos;s ability and willingness to share the screen with other actors.  In some of the retellings he is a supporting character or featured extra, and as an actor he&apos;s more than willing to let our attention shift to someone else.  A lesser actor might have been afraid of that shift of focus.  Way to go, Nicolas.  That&apos;s a real sign of maturity as an actor.\n\nSo did I buy into De Palma&apos;s bag of tricks?  Yup, 100%.  It&apos;s nice to see a movie that isn&apos;t afraid of the old razzle-dazzle.  I do appreciate subtlety and complex ideas- that&apos;s why I&apos;m a voracious reader.  I really don&apos;t think I&apos;d enjoy De Palma directing an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel or REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST.  The Merchant- Ivory people do that sort of thing so nicely.  But it was nice to sit back for an hour and a half and let a master showman use illusion to fool us and let our eyes fool our brains.\n\nOn a five scale, Pops gives it four slot machines."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Krampus&quot;, based on actual folklore in Germany and Austria, may not be without faults, but damn if it isn&apos;t a reasonably impressive new addition to the canon of Yuletide genre movies. It starts out as an obnoxious domestic comedy, as one family welcomes their grating relatives in for the holidays. Young Max, played by the very appealing Emjay Anthony, is so distraught by the friction between his kin that he destroys his letter to Santa and turns his back on the Christmas season. Big mistake: an imposing demon named Krampus makes it his mission to punish - make that SEVERELY punish - all those who lose their hopes and beliefs. Soon, horrible weather conditions presage an escalating series of terrors for Max and company.\n\nCo-written and directed by Michael Dougherty, who also gave us a modern Halloween favorite in the form of &quot;Trick r Treat&quot;, this is surprisingly engaging entertainment. However, it&apos;s not so much a horror comedy, as it is a full-blown horror movie with some moments of levity. Despite the PG-13 rating, it&apos;s not for the youngest members of your own family due to some incredible intensity. It does take on the tones of a nightmare.\n\nIt does have its pleasures, such as a rich variety of &quot;monsters&quot;, which are huge, hideous abominations of familiar toys and goodies. (This viewers&apos; personal favorite was the anaconda sized Jack in the box.) There is some very potent atmosphere and quite a bit of macabre imagery filling up the 2.35:1 frame.\n\nHow one responds to the protagonists will most likely affect how they respond to the film. Yours truly wouldn&apos;t have minded seeing almost everybody get theirs. Still, the actors give it 100%: Adam Scott and Toni Collette as Maxs&apos; parents, David Koechner as the gun loving uncle, Conchata Ferrell as the grumpy great aunt, and Krista Stadler as the wise grandmother who knows the score, right from the start.\n\nA solid diversion overall, with some groan inducing dialogue and moments but quite a bit of energy &amp; pizazz and a twisted nature.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

Suicidal themes run amuck, so, as you can imagine, there are many dark, intense scenes between talented actors. And the performances really are great, as is the mind-bending cinematography. But its way overwritten...the truly brilliant &quot;interesting plot device&quot; mingles but never bonds with the characters or dialogue, so everything falls flat. It&apos;s not rewarding, because insignificant elements overshadow details crucial to experiencing the intended impact of the film.\n\nIf you want to see an astonishingly filmed, well acted movie, here it is, have fun...But Stay breaks the first commandment of film-making because it takes itself more seriously than its subject. At the end of the day, the message the filmmakers seem to communicate is, &quot;see what we did!&quot; instead of &quot;see what we mean.&quot;",

Even better it&apos;s true to life humor, things that would actually happen. you are drawn into the &quot;family&quot; that is the class and you are led to see the changes taking place in people, instead of having it shoved in your face like your too basic to understand.\n\nI would also like to note the music. It was wonderful and did what music is meant to for movies, setting the moods the score was present in the background but not overwhelming (as in so many other movies lately) the music didn&apos;t overshadow the story that was unfolding in any way. \n\nOverall a very good movie that I will be happy to see again, and even happy to pay full ticket price (which is saying something!). Great job and thank you to all who worked on this movie, in my eyes it&apos;s a winner. ^_^ \n\n&quot;My badness&quot; *chuckle*"

      "reviewBody": "The Wedding Planner tells an identifiable story about falling in love and failing to recognize it. \n\nThe Wedding Planner stars Jennifer Lopez as Mary Fiore, a hardworking, beautiful, single woman of Italian descent, who has made a reputable career as a wedding planner.  Fully dedicated to her work, Mary successfully coordinates all the details of her wealthy clients&apos; weddings. She even acts as a kind of therapist, transmitting to the brides and grooms-to-be the optimism that relieves them of their &quot;second-thoughts&quot;, and that allows them to fulfill their true dreams of marrying. Yet one day, a literal &quot;faux pas&quot; turns Mary&apos;s orderly life upside-down: she walks across a street and gets her shoe stuck in a manhole. Just then, a dumpster menacingly rolls down the steep San Francisco street, towards her. Noticing that the dumpster is rapidly gaining speed, a young man rushes to help Mary out of her dilemma. The two are instantly enveloped by the rush of the moment, falling victims to love at first sight. Soon, however, fate shows its cruel side, proving that the handsome Steve Edison (Mathew McConaughey) is tied to Fran Donelly (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras), one of Mary&apos;s most promising clients. In the meantime Salvatore (Alex Rocco), Mary&apos;s concerned father, tries to inspire her to consider her childhood inamorato Massimo (Justin Chambers), who just arrived from Italy. Torn between acting sensibly and fulfilling her long suppressed dreams of marrying, Mary must first determine which love is the one destined for her.\n\nThe Wedding Planner exploits the physical beauty of its star (Lopez) and emphasizes her character&apos;s style and professionalism at work, while defining her personality as that of a free-spirited, down-to-earth person who enjoys dancing and playing Bingo with her father and his elderly friends. Similarly, her costar (McConaughey) is depicted as a good-looking, sensitive man who enjoys his work as a pediatrician. However, the film&apos;s secondary characters, especially Mary&apos;s family, friends and coworkers, are sketchy and mostly inconsequential. Thus, The Wedding Planner creates a story that solely revolves around the coupling of its two main characters; a choice which makes The Wedding Planner&apos;s plot extremely predictable, although at times amusing. While the plot complications are limited to the unavailability of either of the two main characters (where Steve is unable to abandon his prior commitments and Mary is ready to take up new ones), The Wedding Planner is most enjoyable when it creates romantic settings for its lovesick characters.",

The acting is next-level; every performance feels lived-in, even with all the genre craziness. These aren&apos;t just idols fighting demons, they&apos;re friends, sisters, legends in the making. I cared about every single one of them, which made every twist hit that much harder. The writing balances emotional depth with pop-culture fun. There are genuine character arcs, sharp humor, and moments of real heartbreak. It doesn&apos;t rely on tropes, it plays with them, elevates them. And the music. My god, the MUSIC. Not just earworms, these tracks are woven into the story. A power ballad becomes a battle cry. A training montage becomes a music video. A finale turns into a full-blown pop opera. It&apos;s genius.\n\nStylish, heartfelt, funny, fierce, and totally original. This isn&apos;t just a movie, it&apos;s a whole vibe.

The movie is basically about getting a nightlife, friendship and picking up girls. The movie centers on Mike (Jon Favreau). A very brave but not cocky young man who constantly dwells on his ex-girlfriend and unsuccessfully attempts to rekindle his love life. Trent (Vince Vaughn) is always there to give him encouragement and inspiration. In someways Trent is the star of this movie. He has a strong screen presence and is extremely funny.\n\nThis movie teaches us to always double down on an eleven in black jack and how many days to wait before you call the girl for the first time. The greatest scene in this movie has to be when Trent and Sue are talking to Mike in the lounge and are trying to encourage Mike to ask a girl at the bar for her phone number. The &quot;big bad bear and little bunny&quot; analogy they use is hilarious.\n\nYou have to feel happy for Mike when he meets Lorraine (Heather Graham) at the end of the movie. We see Trent and Sue watching their buddy in amazement but we know that they are truly proud of him. Mike really was money and he didn&apos;t even know it."

      "reviewBody": "Walter Hill is one of those directors who seems never to make an average film. His movies are, generally-speaking, either very good or very bad. 48 Hours is one of his &quot;very good&quot; offerings. It gives Eddie Murphy one of cinema&apos;s most unforgettable movie debuts, and invents the conventions of the buddy cop genre that were to become blueprints for years to come. Every buddy picture after 1982 - including Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, Fled, Bad Boys, and a thousand more - owes something to 48 Hours.\n\nThe film opens with psychopathic Albert Ganz (James Remar) escaping from a chain gang. Determined to track down Ganz, tough cop Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) springs a fast-talking convict named Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) from jail for forty-eight hours, during which time the mismatched duo must find their quarry. Cates doesn&apos;t like blacks, and Hammond doesn&apos;t like cops, so before they can even get to the business of tracking down their man they first have to come to terms with working alongside each other.\n\nFast-paced, energetic, foul-mouthed and funny, 48 Hours is simply a great ride. Nolte underplays brilliantly, wisely allowing Murphy to handle the loud and showy role while he etches a gruff, rugged characterisation as a cop on the warpath. The leading characters are rounded off wonderfully by James Remar, as a genuinely bad &quot;baddie&quot;. If the plot to 48 Hours sounds like a collection of all the clichés and predictabilities that ruin most films, it&apos;s important to remember that before this film nothing like it had really been done. These plot devices and conventions are only considered &quot;cliches&quot; nowadays because 48 Hours was so influential, not to mention frequently-imitated, in the ensuing years. James Horner&apos;s music score is perfectly judged too. Finally, no review of 48 Hours would be complete without some acknowledgment of the film&apos;s most famous scene. I&apos;m talking - of course - about the bit where Murphy causes a stir in a redneck bar. More often than not famous movie scenes fail to live up to their lofty reputation, but in this case that simply isn&apos;t so. It really is an electrifying screen moment.... in a film that really is an electrifying screen experience!",

Not very often. And how often are they both killers, who would be more than happy to kill each other? Only once, so far as I know. It is a great combination, and proof that Stallone was not just a star of the 80s -- he is just as strong here (and some would say he is still good in 2015).\n\nThis also happens to be one of those Julianne Moore films that has her as a main character before you realized that Moore was a big star. Maybe at this point it was more obvious, but it is quite surprising how many films she did before she was seen as an A-list actress.",

After viewing this film again I&apos;m just stupefied why didn&apos;t Meryl Streep win Best Actress in this movie. The role of Karen Blixen was very complex and she performed it beautifully. This is probably right up there with &quot;Sophie&apos;s Choice&quot; and &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; both Award winning performances for her and this is right there with &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot; and &quot;A Cry in the Dark&quot;.\n\nSyndey Pollock hit the nail right on the head with this classic beautiful cinematography. The acting is excellent by Streep, Redford, and Klaus Maria Brandeur.  I liked the scene when Karen (Streep) wants her servant to address her by her name and he said &quot;You are Karen, Sabu&quot;.  I also loved the owl that she had in her room - it was a small one, but it was so cute and I loved it.\n\nIf you have a chance to rent this movie, please do - it is a classic.  I love the beginning line &quot;I had a farm in Africa&quot;  it was so moving!!"

      "reviewBody": "If you watch a lot of films, you develop an instinct for what is happening behind the camera. Some films -- heck, most films -- are all about the money, the box office, the payoff.\n\nNot so with auteur Rick Famuyiwa&apos;s DOPE. Running at an overlong 1:45, you sense that money might have been the last thing on this writer/director&apos;s mind when he crafted the script; created some of the most endearing characters in modern film; carefully snuck into the dialog his puns, life lessons and bon mots; extracted top performances from his team; and ultimately created an experience that more &quot;overwhelms&quot; the viewer with images and ideas than &quot;overpowers.&quot; \n\nI liked it. I really liked it. But I go out of my way to catch films that most mainstream viewers don&apos;t, because film as a medium fascinates me.\n\nThe other IMDb members have done some great reviews and I don&apos;t want to repeat what has been said.\n\nI do want to add this: technically the film is almost perfect. There is nothing obviously wrong with any scene, trope, performance ... it all works. And passion? There is tons of passion, nicely hidden in the script, obvious only in the way the film alternates back and forth between fast noisy action, and contemplative self-absorbed scenes of the type you would be more likely to find in a Woody Allen picture. Even with voice-over.\n\nIt has everything but pacing -- and that is the critical flaw. Famuyiwa tried so hard to cram so much into DOPE that the film lacks internal rhythm. By the very end, the viewer, while appreciative of the characters and the story, is pretty much lost.\n\nOne hopes that in his next project Famuyiwa will pay more attention to the viewers and less to his own &quot;bucket list&quot; of things he wants to cram into the story.\n\nIn that way, what starts as merely good ... could be great.",

An ordinary woman looking for love and happiness derailed by her own star quality? The movie represents all of these views and refuses to settle the question.

      "reviewBody": "I was excited for this flick. I thought it looked like it could be a fun, crazy supernatural whodunnit kind of story. So, I went in with some fairly high hopes. Did the film live up to them? Well...not exactly.\n\nIt&apos;s well acted (Radcliffe gives a solid performance when he&apos;s actually focusing on acting and not on his accent) and incredibly well shot. I could not get over how gorgeous some of the cinematography is. However, there are a few things that bog it down considerably for me. The voice-over narration feels very forced in there and I thought that some of the exposition dialogue really killed lots of the more dramatic moments. It also suffers from very uneven pacing and the story flows is too jumbled at times. \n\nOverall, I recommend it. It&apos;s a fine flick that you won&apos;t regret watching at least once, but it ultimately didn&apos;t do much for me.",

Let&apos;s start by saying as a historical document it sucks - everyone knows that it was a British crew that found the naval Enigma machine and code books, fact. However, the second world war did happen and submarines sank ships. The film was quite well made and fairly well acted but the story should be taken with the proverbial pinch of salt. Robin Hood, Men in Tights was more historically accurate. There have been many submarine films including the superb German made &quot;Das Boot&quot; and an old British black and white film made on a shoestring budget - &quot;Morning Departure&quot; - based on the true story the sinking of HMS Truculent and the attempts made to rescue her trapped crew."

The premise is good decent as it is gender opposite and makes sense in a way, but overall the comedy just wasn&apos;t funny.\n\nThe cast was good, John Cena as the over protective father was perhaps the highlight. Other than that, the film is predictable in the end, with somewhat of a sequel type ending. However, this film probably won&apos;t end up getting a sequel due to it not being that big of a success.

Soren and Kludd are young owls about to learn to fly, but accidentally fall out of their nest and are captured by other owls to be slaves. From there on they go through many things with different consequences. While that&apos;s going on many new characters are introduced, and that&apos;s where they sacrifice quality in exchange of quantity. Some characters are annoying one-note comic reliefs (don&apos;t remember their names) and were not serving much of to the story.\n\nBUT the saving grace was the villains! Oh god they were intimidating! If Disney&apos;s Maleficent and Frollo had a child, that would be them! Every time they&apos;re on screen I got the chills! Enslaving other owls because they view themselves as superior!\n\nEven if it has a story with flaws and a mixed bag of main characters, I can without a doubt tell that this is the best looking animated movie to be released in a long time and set the bar unbelievably high for the rest of the 2010&apos;s. Don&apos;t know if a better looking movie has turned up considering the fact that we&apos;re currently at the end of 2018, but this is a tough one to beat.",

      "reviewBody": "Aged 19, Geum-ja Lee confesses as the woman who abducted and murdered the child Won-mo Park. At the time the tabloids cause a clamour against her but this dies down once she is inside and forgotten. She is reached out to inside and finds faith and redemption. However almost 14 years later she is released and decides she no longer has need for this and sets out to catch up with those she knew from inside her prison, all the while working up to her plan to take revenge on the man who robbed her of this chunk of her life.\n\nHaving surprised myself by how much I liked Oldboy, I decided to watch this film as a follow-up. For the majority of it, the story has enough to it to hold the interest easily; the actual core deed is not as interesting on its own as it is shorn of the mystery of Oldboy, however in theory this means it is more about the people and the emotional impact of the act and the vengeance more than the violence. I say in theory because I must be honest and say that I found it a lot less emotionally engaging than I would have liked. In some ways it is strong in this area but mostly it didn&apos;t have the heart that I thought it was trying to get to. The narrative is still enough to fill the running time but the second half is, dare I say it, a bit duller than it should have been just because the humanity wasn&apos;t there.\n\nPark must shoulder some responsibility for this but he does make up for it with the style and delivery that drew me into Oldboy. He has scaled it back from that (hence the feeling that this was meant to be more about the heart) but it is still visually engaging and uses various techniques to enhance the delivery. Yeong-ae Lee appears to have been given more insight into the material than I was because her delivery is full of emotion and hurt. She brings it out whenever she can but for some reason the film generally doesn&apos;t support her in this. The support cast are mostly good but the film belongs to her and is best when the scenes centre on either her story or her character.\n\nOverall though, not as good as the praise and ratings here would suggest but still an engaging film on several levels. Stylish and interesting it only stuttered by being surprisingly emotionally muted for large chunks where I felt it needed to be more convincing and impacting. Fans of the other Park films will enjoy it as a conclusion to the trilogy but it is hard not to feel that it could have done more."

While escaping the town bullies, a group of teenagers break into the house to hide and it is in this house they find a dusty old book full of terrifying stories but as they take it away with them, new stories begin to appear in the book and the group of friends start to disappear one by one. When I first saw this advertised, I had never heard of the books on which it is based and from the trailer I couldn&apos;t figure out who the audience for this story might be. From the trailer I felt it was aimed at young teenagers but then some of the imagery used on screen seemed so terrifying and disturbing i thought it couldn&apos;t possibly be. Well it turns out it is aimed at teenagers and if i was a teenager watching this i would probably have loved it. As an adult i did still enjoy it, the horror elements were done brilliantly, scary, disturbing and memorable. It&apos;s the bits in between the horror that let it down slightly. I just felt the characters weren&apos;t developed enough and didn&apos;t really gel together like the young cast of IT did. Visually impressive and a decent story behind it but could have done with some extra time dedicated to character development.",

      "reviewBody": "A lot of &apos;The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996)&apos; is decidedly silly, especially when it comes to its over-the-top, tonally jarring and generally just outright ridiculous action sequences. The heroes are essentially indestructible, despite the heavy beating they both endure by the film&apos;s end, to the point that it becomes quite ludicrous they&apos;d survive the events they do (indeed, the original script was much darker and even included a major death, which was shot but recut because of audience testing). However, there&apos;s generally a knowing vibe the the flick, one that&apos;s marked by Shane Black&apos;s signature witty banter and some almost ostentatious performances, and this allows the picture to remain fun regardless of its occasional tonal issues, its cartoonish action scenes and all its unkept mayhem (seriously, the flick has quite the body-count). It has an almost satirical feel that&apos;s compounded by the several scenery-chewing monologues, tried-and-tested genre cues and people who refer to themselves as spies with a straight face. 6/10",

I laughed at the way Martin&apos;s character acted when his daughter announced her wedding plans and the scene that was touching was when father and daughter were outside and snow began falling it was nice.\n\nMartin Short&apos;s role as Franck Eggelhoffer was both comical and very funny. George Banks (Martin) a middle class man and owner of a sports shoe company has it all a great job, a nice house, a beautiful wife Nina (Keaton) and son Matt (Culkin). He&apos;s in for the surprise of his life when his 22 year old daughter Annie (Williams) comes home and announces that she&apos;s getting married to Bryan MacKenzie (Newburn)a computer genius from a wealthy family.\n\nFrom then on George is in a constant state of panic because the wedding will cost too much and the fact that his daughter is grown up. However by the end of the movie he finally accepts that his daughter is an adult and has her own life.\n\nThe rest of the cast gave great performances I recommend this movie to fans of Steve Martin who enjoy his comedy antics 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "The Flinstones, next to The Simpsons, it&apos;s one of the best known animated shows of all time, we all know the name Fred Flinstone. It&apos;s such a great series, I grew up watching it, I still will catch an episode or two on the Cartoon Network and I&apos;m sure it&apos;s something that my children will watch too one day. So in 1994, we had the live action version of The Flinstones come into theaters, my family took me to see it, I was 9 years old, it was either this or Pulp Fiction, I&apos;m sure my parents didn&apos;t struggle much with that decision. But still as a kid I absolutely loved this movie, I think I wore out the VHS quite a bit. So I grew up and of course caught the movie on HBO, I figured that I would just give the movie another shot to see if it was still as fun as I remembered and actually I still love it.\n\nCliff Vandercave, the Executive Vice President of Industrial Procurement at Slate &amp; Co., plans to appoint a Vice President of his division to frame for a crime. To find one, he makes an exam to give to the quarry operators, among whom are Barney Rubble and Fred Flintstone. Fred loans Barney money so he and his wife, Betty can adopt a child. They adopt a caveboy named Bamm-Bamm. Barney appreciates what Fred did for him and is determined to pay him back. While taking the exams, Fred fails it, and is disappointed since he will not be able to give his wife, Wilma the wealthy life she used to have. Barney takes Fred&apos;s exam up for him and notices how poorly he did. To pay him back for giving him the money to adopt Bamm-Bamm, he swaps his exam with Fred&apos;s and Fred is promoted to Vice President. Cliff orders Fred to fire Barney because of his exam score, and he fires Barney at the Rubbles&apos; surprise party, but does his best to help Barney afterwards with financial problems. But Cliff still has big plans to set Fred up for a big fall and the Rubbles are starting to get sick of the Flinstone&apos;s over the top extravagances.\n\nHonestly, I really did enjoy The Flinstones as much as I did when I was a kid, I know the main reason a lot of people complain about this movie is because of the casting, but even with Rosie O&apos;Donnell in it I thought she was adorable, we had a great cast, everyone has their own ideas, but just deal with it and understand who this movie was made for. Granted as an adult I&apos;m not going to go out of my way to watch this movie by myself, but I still wouldn&apos;t mind at all showing this to my younger cousins and watching it with them. It has cute jokes, a fun cast, and a good story with tons of fun sets and props. I would recommend this movie to watch with your family if you get the chance, it&apos;s a rockin&apos; good time.\n\n7/10",

It was a collective catharsis, I only remember a group experience of the same intensity watching Crouching Tiger in its Cannes premiere.\n\nThe audience applauded the film five times, the last a standing ovation. Capitão Nascimento has become the alter ego of every Brazilian, seeking a secure place to live. I think the film will find an echo in neighboring Latin American countries. \n\nCompared to Tropa de Elite 1, the second delivery is a much more mature picture, a deeper look into the issues that plague every Latin American major city- citizen&apos;s security, human rights, and political responsibility.\n\nSince City of God, I have not seen such a round and impactful film about the social reality in Brazil. Remarkable work of José Padilha, Braulio Mantovani with a seamless screenplay. Lula Carvalho&apos;s precise work as a DOP, Daniel Rezende&apos;s brilliant editing, not to mention Wagner Moura&apos;s surprising delivery as a mature Nascimento.\n\nA total must see, and absolute award season favorite",

Both an acid indictment of the British class system and an unflinching portrayal of a man who in the end cannot transcend his largely self-imposed limitations, the film is both fascinating and agonizing to watch and its cumulative emotional impact will stay with you long after it&apos;s over. \n\nThere is an exquisite moment near the finale when Thompson&apos;s character bares only slightly a hint of the feelings she has for Hopkins, an allusion to what might have been between them. And Hopkins, in his consummate skill, maintains in both facial and vocal expressions the most non-committal of replies; his face a mask of bland affability but his eyes dark with the knowledge that he is a dead man who has wasted his life. With no outward show of emotion, the scene is devastating.\n\nTHE REMAINS OF THE DAY may not be a happy film, but it is a memorable and powerful one.",

Sometimes they can just be fun, and this one is.\n\nYou have to suspend disbelief on a few technical scientific things, such as sending a message from SETI into outer space, remember that radio waves travel at the speed of light, and the nearest star to use is 4.3 light years away. So at BEST it would take 8 years to send/receive a message, but most stars in our galaxy are 50,000 light years away or so, so the message to one of those would take 100,000 years to send/receive.\n\nThen we can&apos;t create DNA of a human, how are we going to create the DNA of an Alien species from scratch given just the data about it? But don&apos;t worry about those details, just have fun with it, watch the pretty little half-alien girl kill with much gore.. And the team of experts they send to catch the now fully-grown woman/alien is kind of fun too. Very cliché characters, but still fun.\n\nI like the deep, hard-to-understand movies as well, but this one kept me entertained all the way through. Not the greatest movie ever made but not boring either. A fun B-movie type science fiction/horror movie, but with good actors.\n\nI&apos;m giving it an 8, which to me means, &quot;liked it&quot;, whereas a 6 to me would mean &quot;it was OK&quot;. It was more than OK so I give it an 8.",

A plot reminiscent of The Magnificent Seven. It&apos;s such a fun light-hearted movie I don&apos;t see why it has so many detractors. Perhaps the humor isn&apos;t crude enough. This is certainly one of Landis&apos; least vulgar comedies. To me the movie has an old-school kind of charm about it. It&apos;s full of lots of great sight gags, memorable lines, and cute Randy Newman songs. It moves at a nice pace and seems to enjoy its story instead of overloading you with one &quot;bit&quot; after another. So give it a shot if you like Landis&apos; work or the work of the three stars. It&apos;s one of my favorite 80s comedies.",

      "reviewBody": "An accomplished film from young writer/director Ryan Coogler detailing the events that led up to the murder of Oscar Grant, a 20-something black man, by San Francisco police on New Year&apos;s Eve.\n\nMost of the film is a day-in-the-life study of Oscar, a young man who&apos;s trying to get straight in an environment that doesn&apos;t make it easy. He&apos;s recently spent time in jail when the movie opens, and he&apos;s lied to his girlfriend (with whom he shares a young daughter) about getting fired from his job. The lure of petty drug hustling is strong, but he&apos;s fighting the temptation, and he&apos;s got a mom (Octavia Spencer) who checks in occasionally to remind him how disappointed she&apos;ll be if he falls back on crime. The film avoids making any kind of hero out of Oscar -- he&apos;s a decent guy who&apos;s fighting the odds in not terrible but not great circumstances, and though his murder could easily have become a symbol of white oppression (which in real life it did), the movie doesn&apos;t force that idea down its audience&apos;s throats.\n\nOne of the things I liked best about &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; was how honest it was about its portrayal of white/black relations. White people don&apos;t play much of a role at all in these black people&apos;s lives -- the cop who murders Oscar is white, but the film shows other interactions with random white people that are perfectly normal and kind. The movie isn&apos;t concerned with preaching about how whites and blacks should get along -- instead it acknowledges that whites and blacks exist in very different cultures and explores the worst case scenario of how tragic the outcome can be when one doesn&apos;t make the slightest effort at accepting the humanity of the other.\n\nGrade: A-",

One thing I didn&apos;t like is that the opening has the original crew meet a different crew and doesn&apos;t show us how or why. I did see Generations in the theater because I liked the idea of the two groups working together, but it was mostly too blah. I liked Data&apos;s comedy, but there wasn&apos;t much action or interaction with the groups together, aside from Shatner and Stewart. I think the visuals were cool and it had some laughs, but the rest was nothing special. William Shatner is only at the beginning and end of the film.",

The realistic story line, the classic dialogue, and the horrific finale are the film&apos;s best features.\n\nWhat bothers me is that many people discredit the film. Saying that the movie is exploitation, or something even more ridiculous. I think that people are unable to except the fact that Kids is accurate. Not all teenagers behave like Telly or Casper, but you&apos;d be lying if you said that teenagers don&apos;t talk like that. \n\nKids is not exploitation, but rather a brutally honest piece of social commentary. Kids is a deterrent for high risk sexual behavior. The film is also a wake up call for insensitive parents who take no responsibility for their children. \n\nTherefore, Kids is a truthful portrayal of urban life.  it is not exploitation.",

      "reviewBody": "I was sceptical of watching this film at first. It looked like a low budget, and amateur attempt for Netflix to get bigger in their original film business. I went to IMDb to see what people had to say, noticed it got decent reviews and decided to give it a shot. Let me say, this is one of the best films I have ever seen within this genre.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, I will say that this is about the general civil warfare that exists in Africa, something most western, shelterd Americans have never even fathomed and have only learned about through movies. The film doesn&apos;t specify what part of Africa it is, but you know it is something that is real.\n\nNetflix doesn&apos;t hide anything about the realities of what happens to families, children, fathers, and brothers, as well as the numbness the war leaders (on both sides, really) have toward excessive and brutal violence. Imagine: the film shows all of this through the eyes of a boy, probably only 12 years old. He is forced into a mercenary squad after his family is torn apart, and he experiences something that is even darker than hell itself.\n\nThat young boy, played by Abraham Attah, puts on a performance I have never seen before in a child actor. Given the mature content of the film, it is quite unbelievable that the torn emotions any child would have, given this situation, is so clearly displayed and authentic. Every scene just tore at my soul; I wondered if it was really acting. And he wasn&apos;t the only one; women, children, and the &quot;extras&quot; in the film: are these people really doing their first major film? Each scene left me speechless.\n\nThe emotional involvement I had with this film as a viewer is astonishing. I felt ashamed at myself for thinking my life had problems, for thinking my life was hard. I felt foolish realizing my immaturity in life, and felt embarrassed for us as America in general, for caring so much about things so materialistic and shallow, when people in Africa (and other parts of the world, no doubt), are fighting for their lives every day, being torn apart by corrupt leaders and greed.\n\nTo compare this film, it is similar to The City of God and Blood Diamond, but in an of itself, it is certainly unique. It&apos;s a masterpiece.",

This one has it all, but mostly laughs. This Clint Eastwood produced and directed movie is great simply because the cast doesn&apos;t appear to take it seriously. They are just having fun. And special effects? They are better here than other movies like Armageddon and Deep Impact.\n\nIf you like movies where people are considered outdated or replaceable and prove the experts wrong, then this is the one. I watch it and keep getting reminded about all those COBOL experts who were back making the big bucks just prior to the millennium change.",

I finished the show in two weeks and is now one of my favorite TV comedies ever, so I was seeing this film either way. As it stands, this definitely does the series justice. Oh, it definitely wasn&apos;t anything out of the ordinary or unpredictable, but just like the show, it&apos;s able to still be completely hilarious and really touching when it comes down to it. The four characters have deeply resonated with me, and the movie just further expands their arcs in mostly successful ways. Even though the movie may not have the freshness the series has many times, it works because it still has the same humor, and the characters are definitely true to themselves. It&apos;s a riot!"

NYPD officer Ralph Sarchie (Eric Bana) investigates a series of disturbing crimes with his partner Butler (Joel McHale). He&apos;s married to Jen (Olivia Munn) with a daughter. Jesuit priest Mendoza (Édgar Ramírez) is fighting the evil and Sarchie joins in to investigating a group of returning marines.\n\nThe movie sets up a good dark murky NYC. Eric Bana is good at being the brooding intense guy. Joel McHale is the wise-cracking sidekick. Surprisingly, he muscles up and gets into a few fights. Filmmaker Scott Derrickson has zeroed in on the dark moody style. However the movie slowly loses momentum. The tension fades. Instead of intensifying the excitement, it get muddled exorcism talk. Also, Butler seems to be replaced by Mendoza. It would probably be better to keep Butler inside the group. It&apos;s a lot of darken rooms and jump scares. The movie never finds the next gear.",

      "reviewBody": "The Christmas Chronicles (2018) starts with a straightforward plot: two kids set out to catch Santa Claus on camera. Despite the simplicity and potential clichés in such an idea, the film manages to deliver an enjoyable and engaging Christmas experience with a smart approach and solid structure.\n\nThe film&apos;s storyline flows smoothly and keeps the audience engaged. Although the core of the plot is simple, the movie builds tension and excitement through a lively narrative. One of the highlights is Kurt Russell&apos;s portrayal of Santa Claus; he brings charisma and uniqueness to the role, presenting Santa as an energetic, confident, and memorable character, different from traditional portrayals of Santa in film.\n\nBeyond Russell&apos;s strong performance, the film&apos;s production design, costumes, and soundtrack all enhance the Christmas ambiance, creating a vivid, magical atmosphere. The music and design elements add layers of enjoyment that contribute to the film&apos;s holiday spirit.\n\nHowever, the movie does face some issues with logical inconsistencies and temporal mismatches. While The Christmas Chronicles is a fantasy, which allows for some suspension of disbelief, a few plot points could disrupt the story&apos;s rhythm, breaking immersion for the viewer. Though minor, these inconsistencies detract slightly from the film&apos;s overall impact.\n\nDespite these minor flaws, The Christmas Chronicles remains a delightful, modern Christmas film, ideal for family viewing during the holiday season. With a unique Santa portrayal and a storyline full of festive adventure, it&apos;s highly recommended for holiday entertainment.",

It is a wonderful beginning to a very chilling film, directed by the modern horror meister John Carpenter.  As with most of his films, Carpenter creates a scary atmosphere through moody settings(the California coastline, a lighthouse, an old Church), relentless mood music as in Halloween, good character acting(Holbrook, Houseman, Curtis, Leigh), and a claustrophobic feeling of something vice-like gripping you.  The story has some plot problems, but none enough to detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.  Adrienne Barbeau is as lovely as ever in the lead, and the film is credible amidst the background of supernatural actions."

      "reviewBody": "Horror Comedy? Uhm, yeah, no. Sure, there&apos;s a handful of funny moments and some scary stuff but it&apos;s far from being a horror comedy. This is a very traditional &quot;Nicolas Cage&quot; drama, through and through. It has an air of humor and awkwardness throughout all of it due to his performance, but overall, there&apos;s a bigger picture behind it. Oddly enough, in a lot of ways it felt like a very late companion piece to Cage&apos;s performance in The Weather Man, a movie where his character also deals with consequences of fame while dealing with a crumbling family life. The biggest difference is that Dream Scenario leans farther into the consequences of fame that celebrities never asked for and that consumers fail to understand because of the media. This is a very sad and upsetting movie that I would say accurately captures that feeling of not having control of your life. It&apos;s definitely among the best films I&apos;ve seen this year.",

      "reviewBody": "The Duchess is a superior slice of costume drama which manages to craft interesting, multi dimensional characters and an involving storyline from the well worn confines of the genre.\n\nKeira Knightley plays a very similar role to the one she played in Pride and Prejudice, a feisty, modern woman trapped in a male dominated society. However, whereas Lizzie Bennett&apos;s heart and character inspires affection, the Duchess of Devonshire&apos;s fosters only reproach and punishment from her traditional and patriarchal husband. Her performance is a standout and demonstrates why she is so highly rated in the face of many disappointing roles in other films. She brings both strength and weakness to the character. Able to deliver withering put downs at her husband and others, whilst showing the pain of her loveless marriage etched into her face.\n\nIf Knightley is the lynchpin of the piece then it is Ralph Fiennes that elevates it above a crowded genre. Resisting the temptation to play his character as evil, instead he simply plays him as a man of his times. In Fiennes&apos; hands the Duke feels no need to win any bouts of verbal jousting with his wife as he is secure in the knowledge that, as a husband, he is in complete control of the relationship. The Duke also clearly sees very little wrong in his treatment of his wife and acts, as he sees it, in a logic manner making the whole film feel more believable and, as a result, tragic.\n\nIn terms of the cast the only misstep is Dominic Cooper as Charles Grey, who lends the wide eyes of a political dreamer but doesn&apos;t have convincing chemistry with Knightley and plays one of the more one dimensional characters in the piece. However Hayley Atwell impresses by playing her character so well it is possible to describe her as scheming, and manipulative as well as sympathetic and loyal without it seeming a contradiction.\n\nThe film is deliberately paced so as to give characters and events time to breathe, encouraging the mood that the marriage is a car crash in slow motion, inextricably drawing all the characters further into the muddled mess of their relationships. Overall it&apos;s a fully recommended slice of real life costume drama that draws a multi layered drama full of compellingly deep characters from what could easily have been a one note story.",

The casting is spot on, one of the major differences to the sequel. Bruce Willis is a great choice to play the voice of Mikey, and John Travolta is fantastic. But for me it was George Segal who stole the show for me, playing Mikey&apos;s real father, who in his words is going through a &apos;selfish phase&apos;.\n\nSadly the sequels are simply terrible, but this movie is one of the best comedies I&apos;ve seen in a long time, and I gave it 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "On October 3, 1849 Edgar Allan Poe was found wandering the streets of Baltimore, delirious, calling out the name Reynolds. There have been lots of theories as to what Poe died of, from tuberculosis, rabies or to a drunken bender. &quot;The Raven&quot; puts forth a more romantic theory and a detective story for the man who invented the modern detective novel.\n\n&quot;The Raven&quot; as a movie demonstrates that you can make a movie that bridges the biographical facts of Poe&apos;s life and its own artistic vision and still make an interesting movie. The movie is driven by the premise, a serial killer starts a series of killings in Baltimore that emulate some of the more gruesome murders in Poe&apos;s stories. When the first murder is done inside a locked room, police detective Fields (Luke Evans) recognizes it as the setting of an Edgar Allan Poe story. Fields brings in Poe (John Cusack) at first as suspect, but when another murder occurs Poe quickly becomes the first criminal profiler and consultant. Poe helps Fields both in what kind of mind the killer may have and of course in the details from his stories. The killer kidnaps Poe&apos;s girlfriend Emily (Alice Eve) with the killer promising clues as to Emily&apos;s whereabouts with each new murder he commits.\n\nThe filmmakers, director James McTeigue and writers Ben Livingstone and Hannah Shakespeare don&apos;t try to recast Poe&apos;s character as a superhero or give the movie Poe attributes that the real Poe didn&apos;t or couldn&apos;t possess. As mentioned before, the filmmakers stick fairly accurately to the known elements of Poe&apos;s last few days, although there are some artistic liberties taken, and they still present an entertaining movie with a few twists and turns as to who the murderer is.\n\nCusack is spot on as Poe from his look, thin with a black mustache and goatee, to (more importantly) Poe&apos;s character. Poe was a writer who had the ultimate confidence in his own abilities as a writer and was dismissive of his contemporaries, especially if they were more successful. Cusack is supported by a cast that hits every note right.\n\nIf you think a movie about Edgar Allan Poe won&apos;t have enough action for you, this is a movie for you. If you&apos;re more literary minded and think this movie will have too many inaccuracies or violate Poe&apos;s character or will throw in too much action, you won&apos;t be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "At the risk of boring you all senseless here are some observations off the top of my head. \n\nTHE HUT Representing the self. All the possessions and shelter needed is on the floating hut. When the young man can no longer live at peace and comfort in the hut then bad things transpire. He never commits lustful acts in the hut. When we seek happiness outside ourselves, we are never truly content.\n\n THE DOORS The doors by the lakeside and in the hut are symbolic rather than prescriptive. The fact there are no walls means their use is not forced but elected. They represent morality and discipline. Morality is not defined by a higher power but by society and the self. By adopting the constraints the doors engender, self-discipline is attained. As soon as the young man transgresses these self-imposed boundaries, to sneak across to the young woman, then disaster follows. \n\nTHE DEAD ANIMALS The Master allows the young boy to let the animals die. He does not become an all powerful father figure, cleaning up after him, but allows him to make mistakes and suffer the consequences. Buddhism does not have a higher power but rather promotes self-awareness. \n\nTHE MILLSTONE AND BUDDHA Represent the twin stones of regret for killing the fish and the snake. What you do unto others, you do unto yourself. He has carried that karma around with him all his life until he transcends them both, carrying them to the top of the hill, near heaven. Here he cuts himself free and attains redemption through struggle. \n\nTHE MASTER Is a great teacher, but does not lecture. Hardly a word is spoken, but lessons are learned. A good teacher points the way for a student to discover self-evident knowledge for themselves. \n\nTHE MOTHER The veil, representing guilt and shame are ultimately the cause of her downfall. Hiding from the outside world can bring about ruin.\n\n THE YOUNG BOY Both at the beginning and the end, represents us. A good life is attained not by the absence of bad thoughts, but rather by their mastery, so they have no hold over us. We choose our behaviour rather than it choose us. The new boy is not born without sin, but rather must walk his own path to divinity. The same actor playing the young boy show the eternal cycle of the human soul. \n\nTHE SEASONS The endless cycle of birth, growth and death.",

You can&apos;t look at a serial like a grown up, not with that critical eye They was never meant for critics. They were made to make young fellows gasp at the villains and the cliff hangers, not to make you meditate on the state of the universe. If you wait for deep meaning, then you will be waiting a long time. &quot;Sky Captain&quot; takes us back to the days of &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot; and Gene Autry (Star of the first Scince Fiction Serial &quot;The Phantom Empire.&quot;) If you can divorce your critical self, sit down with a box of popcorn and some Ju-Ju Bes and turn off the lights, let yourself be 8 again.

Its a simple story- several tourists go to a temple in the Mexican jungle that happens to be off the beaten path. There is of course something there and the locals are not happy about visitors. I won&apos;t say more since I&apos;m going tempted to tell you way too much...which would be too much since the plot is simple. Its almost too simple. The reason the film works is that the film has decent characters and it does things that are decidedly not your typical horror movie choices. Its short, its sweet and it works. Its not perfect, there are one or two things I didn&apos;t like, but on the whole its a very good very creepy film. Frankly while Brazil got upset about Touristas a year because it might make think people about going there, Mexico should worry since this film will make anyone think again about going into ancient ruins. (7.5 ish out of 10 on the horror scale because thinking about the screams makes my skin crawl)",

I re-watched it not long ago, and had to admit it had worn out for me, but that&apos;s probably my own fault. It&apos;s not meant to be seen every holiday season. Still, it has very good timing and it&apos;s bittersweet. Bridget Jones&apos; Baby doesn&apos;t and isn&apos;t. It&apos;s dragging and it would make absolutely no sense to anyone not familiar with the first ones. The millennial characters are unfunny and implausible, the writing there is both patronizing and eager to please, like me following my friend&apos;s teenage son on Instagram and commenting YOLO. Pussy Riot and cats that look like Hitler... and the next minute jokes about human rights violations... So, I actually watched for the experience of a 40+ pregnant woman, of any glimpses of successfully acted emotions. And for Colin Firth, and possibly Emma Thompson, although I think I&apos;d now like to forget she has screenplay credit in this. But still, what happened? Was everyone an amateur? It was like the characters from earlier films were all doing cameos. Renee Zellweger was playing herself playing her character 12 years later. No, she was standing in for herself in that role. Her voice was often barely audible, like she was really, really tired.",

      "reviewBody": "Like Charlie Chaplin&apos;s Hitler, Chris Morris&apos; &apos;Four Lions&apos; shows that no subject can escape comic scrutiny; humour always seems to find the ability to expose the ridiculous in otherwise appalling situations. This satirical black comedy vents its disgust at the pseudo-morality of suicide bombing, whilst managing to portray its terrorists with an affection that allows the audience an unexpected emotional attachment with these supposed figures of violence.\n\nThe film follows a terrorist cell of blundering, inept, and impossibly stupid would-be suicide bombers on their quest towards martyrdom – we follow them failing miserably in a Pakistan training camp, trying to run through sheep fields whilst carrying bags of explosives, attaching bombs to crows, all the time creating a chaotic &apos;blooper&apos; reel of attempted martyrdom videos. These suicide bombers are not the feared assassins of popular imagination, but absurd and easily led dupes who encourage laughter and ridicule – and significantly, in the end, pity.\n\nThe comedy of &apos;Four Lions&apos; lies in the power of its bathos: the film reduces the dreaded spectre of suicide bombing to a ludicrous pageant of ineptitude. It&apos;s a film with fast laughs and dim wit in abundance, an absurd &apos;How Not-To Guide&apos; to martyrdom.\n\nHowever, the audience cannot help but feel pity for the characters as their plot reaches its climax. There is a sad inevitability to the group&apos;s last moments together; despite the horror of what the bombers are planning, the audience has been lulled into sympathising with their situation. The sadness of the film comes with the audience&apos;s realisation that these characters are regular, likable, funny, naive people – they are not monsters in themselves, but made monstrous by their susceptibility to absurd, immoral teachings.\n\nThe lead character Omar&apos;s interactions with his wife and young son are painful in their twisted depiction of the ideal family unit. At one point Omar (played by Riz Ahmed) tells his son a bedtime story about &apos;Simba&apos;s Jihad&apos;. It is a scene that is touching, funny and uncomfortable all at once, a reflection of our responses to the film as a whole.\n\n&apos;Four Lions&apos; is provocative in its comic parody of an emotional subject, but there is never any sense that it wishes to be deliberately inflammatory. Instead, the story is told with warmth and sharp humour; it offers us a fine concoction of derision and sympathy, pulling at our affections whilst cutting the terrifying down to the clownish.\n\nJames Gill ------ Find more reviews, news and previews at www.singleadmission.co.uk",

      "reviewBody": "In plain and simple words, I loved CDI. Heck, even if you take SRK out of it, I would still love it! This movie is about a man trying to prove his dedication and love for his sport, his people, and his country. This is about a man scorned by the nation, shunned by his close ones, and his redemption in the way he knows best. Its this main underlying theme that makes CDI special. This theme is so universal, and so identifiable, that your heart connects instantly.\n\nCDI is about Indian sportswomen coming to the forefront, about the stark and grim realities staring at our national sport, and the reasons behind that. It is about unity in diversity, strength in weakness, and putting the team above oneself. Its about the sacrifices one has to make in order to achieve his goals. Its about the success of true sporting spirit! Its real, yet entertaining. Its patriotic without being jingoistic. Its international, yet soaked in Indianness. Its a collage of the different states of India, and the difficult but fruitful formation of this collage.\n\nI have never played or watched or been interested in hockey! But this movie does not need that to touch your heart. All it needs is some patriotism, humility and goodness in your heart. If thats in abundance, I am sure you will love it.\n\nAs for the performances, I would just say the entire team rocks. the keyword here is TEAM, as thats what this film is all about! Enjoy !",

      "reviewBody": "Young Adult is Diablo Cody&apos;s latest utterly refreshing attempt on the life of a once-famous high school queen who was facing challenges in her life. The renowned writer of Juno is making a entirely different attempt here by depicting a mid-life crisis of Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) and her return visit to her hometown where she lived when she was a teenager.\n\nMavis hated the town, hated everything about it, hated all the people in it, that was, except Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson), who used to be her boyfriend. It didn&apos;t take her long to decide that she would return and rescue Buddy who she thought was a hostage in the deadly town with his marriage and newborn daughter. She would save herself from the disappointment from her life, save Buddy from the living hell, and picked up where things ended, once and for all.\n\nAnd well, you expected it. Things were not as simple as that; they never are. So get ready for the adventure in this visit and get ready to know our Mavis better.\n\nCharlize Theron totally manipulated the role of Mavis, letting the audience get to know who Mavis Gary really was as the events continued to unfold. It was a solid, realistic and Oscar-worthy performance that blew the audience away.\n\nYoung Adult is about life, about the past and the present, about why people are easily stuck in the past and do not see a future ahead of them. This is about why we should accept the present and look forward instead of always looking back. It is also more of a drama than a comedy but still it did give me some laughs.",

      "reviewBody": "The bulk of comments concerning this film center on the debate of its superiority/inferiority versus Silence of the Lambs. That line of criticism does not do justice to either movie.\n\nBesides the Thomas Harris link, there is no connection between them at all. Sure, there are shared character names, most notably Dr. Lecter, but not shared characters. Cox&apos;s and Hopkins&apos; interpretations of the infamous cannibal could not be any more different. Whose is better? That&apos;s irrelevant here. What is relevant is Manhunter&apos;s success as a stand-alone feature film.\n\n Michael Mann&apos;s film is standard serial killer fare, which is not necessarily a bad thing. What separates it from its cinematic brethren is its style and class. It&apos;s easy to follow a hunter-prey storyline. What isn&apos;t easy is to provide the audience with well-rounded characters who convey that grey moral ground of real life. In that respect, Manhunter is a success. From the FBI agent teetering on the edge to the killer struggling with his emotions, Mann weaves a complex story that takes a step above the genre.\n\nThe movie is definitely of the 80s. Timelessness is the top determining factor of a film&apos;s &quot;classic&quot; status. Whether or not Manhunter stands the test of time is yet to be seen. The music is already dated, but not to the point of impeding the story. Fortunately, it has not suffered the same fate as the now campy reruns of Miami Vice.\n\nManhunter is not a great movie. It is an above average genre film aided by a stellar cast and crew. Take it for what it is and enjoy an underappreciated thriller."

      "reviewBody": "This is one good looking movie and has many Coen recognisable signature quirks to make it worthy of a comparison to their earlier and later works. I will come back on those quirks later.\n\nI love the way the Coens always combine high-brow subtlety with  low-brow slapstick which makes it so accessible.  This movie is not heavy on subtlety but there are some genius moments in it to make it watchable again and again.  Newman for one is great in this movie and having the best of times. He makes minimal acting an artform.  Really, he could act anyone of that screen with his eyes closed.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is a contrast with her hand waving,her Katherine Hepburn- affected-ballsy way of speaking and general overacting but I guess she sets the scene quite brilliantly to complement the decor and general 30&apos;s feel of the movie.  You see, apparently the Coens have a penchant for the 30&apos;s movies style(and so they should.. Many a great movie was made in that decade) but the story in which an imbecile&apos;s dingus, against all odds became a total Fad and all the rage, doesn&apos;t quite fit that decade.  I can&apos;t think of any Dingus which became all the rage in the thirties (life was too hard for thingamabobs then, I suppose) and the earliest example, the hoolahoop, was definately a brainchild of the 50&apos;s (Life was good and spendable income to buy doodahs was more readily available ).  I don&apos;t mind that at all but I was confused to find out that it was set in the 50&apos;s because of all the visual and audible references to the 30&apos;s.  If Mussburgers office wasn&apos;t an art-deco Love-fest (that clock!)I don&apos;t know what is.\n\nI guess this review is definitely style over content but you know what? That just doesn&apos;t matter because plot is secondary to the visuals, and dialogue in this movie.  And that is just alright by me.  It is the reason why these movies are so good for repeat viewings.  Once you know a plot, you are not likely to watch it again just for the plot&apos;s sake.  It is the sights, the sounds the dialogue that makes you want to watch a movie again and again. Oh you don&apos;t believe me?  Name your favourite movie (not the one you tell your friends is your favourite but the one you watch again and again). What makes you want to watch it repeatedly?  Is it because you want to know what happens for the 100th time?  Ofcourse not!  You want to watch it for the 100th time because of the dialogue, the fun, the special effects the object of your desire etc. etc...\n\nNow I am not saying that plot is not important but I am saying that what makes Coen Brother&apos;s movies so good is that they think about their viewer/audience who wants to watch their movies until they can repeat every line in the movie(and becoming sad anoraks in the process).  I actually know people who watched the Big Lebowski half way and walked out of the cinema only to find them Lebowski addicts after one more viewing.  I am not naming names but you know who you are...\n\nI liked this movie the first time round... I know I will love it later...\n\nNow for the Coen parallels between this movie and the Big Lebowski:\n\nJennifer&apos;s way of speaking was similar to Julianne&apos;s Maud. They were both &quot;feisty&quot; Brunettes who fall for the main character(I wouldn&apos;t call &apos;em heroes)\n\nThe voice over to remind us that it is a fairytale at the beginning and end by guardian-angel-types. (Sam Elliot in Big and Bill Cobbs in the Hudsucker) Bizarre Dance Dream Sequences that have nothing to do with the plot but are hugely enjoyable. Blond Bombshell (Anna-Nicole Smith in Hudsucker and Tara Reid in the Big Lebowski)Who want to seduce the hero. Steve Buscemi. Memorable Lines...\n\nSo all in all I guess I recommend it!\n\n****"

      "reviewBody": "Boy, did this one take a wrong turn at Albuquerque!  Although it&apos;s still pretty entertaining, it&apos;s played far too much for laughs.\n\nAhnuld is back, and this time he gets more dialogue, a big mistake.  He sounds more than a little ridiculous with a large part of his dialogue. Instead of Gerry Lopez, we have Tracy Walter, a fine actor, but too comedic for this (yeah, he&apos;s the comic relief, but Conan shouldn&apos;t have comic relief). Mako is good and Sarah Douglas sizzles as always.  Grace Jones, well, is Grace Jones.  If you are looking for subtlety, look elsewhere. And, speaking of subtlety, there&apos;s &quot;Wilt, the Stilt.&quot;  As an actor, Wilt makes a great basketball player.  Olivia D&apos;Abo is cute, but little else.\n\nThe movie has its moments and the finale is pretty good, but there&apos;s a lot of junk in the middle.  The fight between Conan and Toth-Amon (Pat &quot;Bomber&quot; Roach) is fantastic, but the campfire scenes after are just plain stupid. Tracy Walter&apos;s character gets annoying with the constant Shaggy and Scooby jokes (you know, &quot;I&apos;ll wait here.  Wait for me!&quot;).  The basic story is good and in keeping with Conan traditions, but it descends into camp at the worst times.\n\nRoy Thomas and Gerry Conway were quite familiar with Conan, having written the character for Marvel Comics.  How much of their story is in the final film is a puzzler.  The elements that work are straight out of Howard and Roy Thomas&apos; comics.  The goofier stuff, who knows?\n\nThe first film was epic adventure.  This is more of a glorified B-movie. It&apos;s fun when you have a group of friends together and can &quot;MST3K&quot; it; but as cinema, it&apos;s not 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.  Director Richard Fleischer has done better.  Still, it&apos;s a great &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; film."

      "reviewBody": "The enormous success of &quot;Speed&quot; in 1994 could only create a (poor) sequel. The less we can say is that the scriptwriters have got a great narrow-mindedness. Here, the bus was replaced by a cruise ship and the movie doesn&apos;t work, partly due to this: a cruise ship can&apos;t go as fast as a bus even if it&apos;s trapped.\n\nThen, Keanu Reeves&apos; absence can terribly be felt. His replacement is so colorless and listless that Sandra Bullock almost steals the show from him. Moreover, as a rule, &quot;Speed2: cruise control&quot; is supposed to be a suspense film. Well, in this case, where&apos;s the suspense? The filmmaker doesn&apos;t succeed in creating the suspense and he even can&apos;t create a disturbing atmosphere. The end of the movie falls into the ridiculous when the ship is entering the dock and destroys everything in its path.\n\nAt the end: one of the worst sequels ever made."

      "name": "A thriller about social responsibility:  Haneke in top form",
      "reviewBody": "The title of this engrossing and disturbing new Haneke film is ironic. At the end of the film, Georges Laurent (Daniel Auteuil) tells his wife Anne (Juliette Binoche) that he will be &quot;caché,&quot; hidden, and he takes off his clothes, closes the curtains, and buries himself in bed. It&apos;s afternoon. But he will be exposed, as before. &quot;Caché&quot; is about how you can&apos;t hide. Auteuil, an actor who naturally looks worried and put-upon, and Binoche, who has a vulnerable and frightened look, play a privileged couple whose son Pierrot (Lester Makedonsky) at twelve is a star swimmer. Georges has a literary TV program (like &quot;Le Bouillon de la Culture&quot;), which, in France, makes him a star. They have a beautiful house in an elegant suburb of Paris. (His childhood home, we learn, was a substantial farm.) Beyond all that are the poor outskirts on the periphery of the French capital, the slums, the projects, the &quot;banlieux,&quot; with their Arabs and blacks, French society&apos;s underprivileged and mistreated, unemployed and ignored, a population ready to explode into revolt -- as it very dramatically did in November 2005. \n\nLike Haneke&apos;s previous &quot;Code Unknown,&quot; &quot;Caché&quot; is primarily about alienation and connection. This sounds theoretical and intellectual, but the uncompromising Austrian who now makes his films in French always finds a deep emotional core in his people, in this case a core of the most infinite desperation in both perpetrator and victim. &quot;Code Unknown&quot; focused on chance meetings. &quot;Caché&quot; moves in closer to home, to this family whose peace is shattered and to another family that has never had peace. As the film begins the foreground family begins to receive increasingly menacing videos left on their doorstep that show they are being watched. Georges thinks he knows who it is.\n\n&quot;Caché&quot; blends urban angst with the primal horror of Greek tragedy. What goes around comes around. For what he has explained was his starting point for the film, Haneke elliptically refers within it to the story of hundreds of Algerians the French cast into the Seine in 1961, a story recently unearthed and hitherto largely ignored. Within the film&apos;s foreground we discover that as a youth Georges himself betrayed an Algerian playmate in a way that effectively ruined his life. But the events that unfold are full of mystery and foreboding, and the relation between the Algerian, Majid (Maurice Bénichou), and Georges&apos; current terror and disquiet largely remains uncertain. Is this a thriller? Maybe: it has a thriller&apos;s progressive unease, the suspense and pulse -- up to the end, anyway -- of a good whodunit. But Haneke, a great director in fine form here, has produced something as intellectually challenging as it is emotionally troubling. He operates without the help of surging background music, jump cuts, or snappy chases. And as the final credits roll, the closing long shot (upon which we are again voyeurs, as when the film began), shows us that nothing is resolved. A highly original artist, Haneke continues to explore.\n\nSeen during its Paris run in October 2005. Shown first in the US at the New York and Chicago Film Festivals in October 2005. Opening in NYC and LA (US release title &quot;Hidden&quot;) December 2005, limited US release January 2006. This is a highly visual film and should be seen if possible on a big screen.",

      "reviewBody": "The &apos;burbs is a fun diversion from the usual neighborhood comedies. Joe Dante has a way of combining dark humor and outright horror and make it convincing to a mass audience (see &apos;Gremlins.&apos;) That this film has a lot of dark elements and remains just a light romp at the end is a feat unto itself. All credit goes to Hanks&apos; good natured comedic performance and Dante&apos;s fun with the material.\n\nDante paints a portrait of the neighborhood at the very beginning. Hanks plays Ray, probably the most normal among the neighbors. Art is like a big kid and the first one to suspect the neighbors of foul play. Bruce Dern plays a war vet where Ricky Butler, played by Corey Feldman is the loud teenager. All is well in suburbia until clues pop up that might reveal the new neighbors, the Klopeks, as murderers.\n\nWith any other talent behind the film, this could have been a very dark comedy. But instead of playing up the horror, Dante has fun with it, playing up the comedy talents of his performers (notably Hanks and Dern, who take turns chewing scenery). Dante also has fun with visuals, notably in a hilarious dream sequence that Ray has.\n\nEverything comes together to make this film work, including a great score by Jerry Goldsmith, that is part suburban comedy and part horror, complete with organs culled from a funeral march. This film is far from perfect, but it&apos;s fun diversional comedy and reminds of the great comic actor that Tom Hanks once was before becoming Oscar&apos;s golden boy.",

      "reviewBody": "Centurion is directed by Neil Marshall who also wrote the screenplay. It stars Dominic West, Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Liam Cunningham, Noel Clarke, Riz Ahmed &amp; Imogen Poots.\n\nBritain, 117 AD and the Romans are struggling to contain the Picts in Caledonia. The Roman Governor sends in their best army, the Ninth Legion. But they are victims of a trap and are forced to flee on foot across the mountainous terrain with the vengeful Picts in hot pursuit. Can they stay alive and make it to the border?\n\nOne thing you know you are going to get with a Neil Marshall film is blood and guts. Be it squadies facing off against werewolves, pot-holing babes grappling with hungry Gollum types, or a secret unit sent in to quarantined Scotland to fend off cannibal punk rockers; Marshall likes to pile on the grue. With his latest, Centurion, he continues in this vein. Sadly that&apos;s about all there is as the talented director appears to be getting a little carried away with himself and forgetting to put some substance into his characters. What promises to be a telling historical epic anti-war movie ends up being one long chase movie. Only pausing for breath for intermittent blood letting and the now obligatory love interest sub-plot. Oh it&apos;s fun, very much so, and the visuals coupled with the excellently constructed fight sequences don&apos;t waste a penny spent. But as a whole it just doesn&apos;t work, it&apos;s more a collection of set pieces linked together by visceral pleasures under the guise of being a take on a folklore story.\n\nHowever, there is no denying the commitment to the genre from Marshall. Centurion is often thrilling and brutal into the bargain, so as long as you don&apos;t require any semblance of depth then it will surely entertain you. While he has assembled a very admirable cast of British &amp; Irish thesps and put them thru a very tough shoot up in the Scottish hills. The craft is there, from director and stars, just no decent script to flesh it out. Oh and do we really need Roman soldiers saying the F word to show us how hard they are? Coming after Doomsday flopped (personally I think it&apos;s a whole bunch of fun), Marshall is at the crossroads of his career. Once the indie darling of Britain he&apos;s been courted by Hollywood and needs to make big decisions. You can only homage so much in your favoured genres (here he nods to Gladiator, The Warriors and even Zulu) before it gets to be boring. So is it time to let someone else write now? Also if he must stay mainstream then he has to get the budget to do the job properly; witness the digital blood used for the first fight sequences, laughably bad and able to take you right out of the film.\n\nAt times ridiculous and over the top, Centurion only works well as a pure action flick. Which of course will find an audience. But director and cast are better than this, as an effective story is bogged down by lack of narrative heart that in turn is most likely hidden by arterial blood. Lots of it. 5/10",

      "reviewBody": "The Wall tells the story of Pink; a burnt out rock star who has retreated into himself. Told in a non-linear fashion we see how he is effected by the loss of the father he never knew in the war; cruel teachers; a wife who leaves him; the adulation of his fans and too many drugs and finally how he grows to see himself as a fascist demagogue.\n\nThis is a far from conventional film; there is a minimal amount of dialogue. Instead the story is told through the images we see and the music of Pink Floyd. The images are a mix of conventional live action shots of Pink&apos;s life; images of war and animation designed by Gerald Scarfe. This is sometimes tragic and sometimes brutally disturbing. The scenes we see perfectly match the music; adding something to what isn&apos;t there on the album in a way that makes it hard to just listen without recalling the imagery. The animated sequences demand separate mention; they are creative and shocking in a way one doesn&apos;t expect in western animation; they contain a sense of bleakness, brutality and even flowers that border on pornographic! Overall I&apos;d say that this is a must see for fans of Pink Floyd and for those looking for something different who don&apos;t mind being disturbed.",

      "reviewBody": "For the most part, I like Will Ferrell&apos;s comedy. I really do. I loved Talladega Nights, to be honest. I laughed throughout the whole thing. I had expected this to be a good bounce-back from Blades of Glory. I prayed that Mr. Ferrell just happened to make a flop and was back to making good movies. I was wrong.\n\nI felt the plot itself was solid--I really like it as a non-comedic movie. But it insists on itself--it just begs to be laughed at. The problem with that is that it insists in all the wrong ways. For example, Shaun of the Dead is one of my all-time favorites, mostly because of the fact that it is a rather serious subject with scenes that could be seen as horrific and yet maintains to be laugh-out-loud hilarious every time I watch it. It insists on being a good movie, not on getting you to laugh at cheap jokes. That&apos;s where Semi-Pro went wrong. You have to either be ridiculous with a handful of serious elements (ala The Big Lebowski) or serious with a handful of comedic elements (ala Shaun of the Dead). Semi-Pro doesn&apos;t fit into either, because it&apos;s not good enough in either one of those categories.\n\nI probably only laughed out loud maybe three or four times throughout the whole movie, and more out of a response to pure nonsense than actual comedic value. Like, &quot;....what?!&quot; rather than a response to pure hilarity. I am reminded of the &quot;I&apos;m on fire!&quot; scene from Talladega Nights--hilarity. Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous--you just couldn&apos;t NOT laugh at it. This movie attempts to achieve the same ludicrous hilarity that Talladega Nights had...and fails miserably.\n\nIf you&apos;re a huge fan of Will Ferrell&apos;s comedy, or just Will Ferrell in general, then you may like this. Again, don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s not a horrible movie, but don&apos;t expect anything epic. Unless, of course, you expect an epic fail, in which case you may be pleased.\n\nSo overall: decent movie, good storyline, great cast, horrible jokes and even worse comedic value lands it a 5 out of 10.",

I found the story very intriguing and atmospheric and it held my interest - at the same time I felt something was missing and it just wasn&apos;t as rich, complex and good as it should have been.\n\nI am not sure why, I think the key for me is that I was not able to really get emotionally involved with the love story - and this is first and foremost a love story. I have trouble with most love stories, due to my own particular biases, so there has to be a lot there to really identify with it. I think the problem here was the casting and acting - it could have been a lot better.

There is just something so moody, foreboding, and genuinely unsettling about this film. Its not scary or a horror film in the traditional sense, but watch it alone in the dark and try not to get uneasy in parts. The acting in the film is superb, with an all star cast including Richard Gere, the amazing Laura Linney, and vastly underrated Will Patton among others. Their acting sells this movie. I found myself drawn to their characters regardless of the blandness of the script itself. Credit must also be given to Mark Pellington, the director, for taking a so-so script and crafting a truly creepy and underrated gem from it. I find myself watching this again and again if it happens to be on TV, and it has become one of those guilty pleasure movies for me that I watch just about anytime I see it on along with The Green Mile, Signs, The Shawshank Redemption, and O&apos; Brother, Where Art Thou?. Definitely worth a look, but be forewarned, don&apos;t watch it alone in the dark.",

      "name": "An intriguing if not entirely effective meditation on love, memory and identity.",
      "reviewBody": "In a very real way, our memories are who we are - our identities as individuals depend in an almost terrifying way upon our ability to remember what we do (and what we&apos;ve done), why we do it, and whom we love. That&apos;s why the notion of memory-making (and losing) looms so very large in the art we create. In the cinematic realm alone, characters whose memories are sorely compromised have starred in thrillers (Memento), romantic comedies (50 First Dates) and weepies (The Notebook). Before I Go To Sleep, based on the novel by S.J. Watson, is a chilling if not entirely effective blend of family drama and thriller, trading on the heartache and horror that comes with losing oneself every single day.\n\nChristine (Nicole Kidman) wakes up every morning with no memory of the last fifteen years of her life. Ben (Colin Firth), the stranger who shares her life and bed, informs her that he is her husband and that she lost her ability to make new memories after a bad car accident several years ago. Any attempt to forge lasting memories seems futile - and yet, Christine tries. She receives a phone call from Dr. Nasch (Mark Strong), a neurologist who assures her that they&apos;ve been working to improve her condition. He reminds her that she&apos;s been keeping a video diary every day: one that, upon review, suggests that Ben is not telling her the whole truth about their shared life and history.\n\nIt&apos;s to writer-director Rowan Joffe&apos;s credit that he mostly manages to make a very personal - and inevitably repetitive - journey of discovery both cinematic and chilling. As Christine awakes each day with her memory reset, Joffe finds inventive and intriguing ways to ramp up the spinetingling alienation she feels from her own life and husband. He captures Christine&apos;s terror, doubt and paranoia in the shuddery footage she takes of herself while hidden away in the bathroom from a husband she doesn&apos;t recognise. As the wheels within the narrative spin and turn, Joffe&apos;s camera makes villains and heroes out of everybody: Ben, in particular, shifts from one to the other on an almost daily basis, as Christine doubts and then trusts the love this man must have for her to stay by her side for so many years.\n\nUnfortunately, Joffe can&apos;t quite sustain the tension throughout - the film sags noticeably in parts, as Christine flounders miserably between very few choices. There are many twists, as she uncovers people and secrets in her past that will inevitably disappear from her grasp within a day, including a final doozy of a revelation. But Joffe winds up wasting much of this tension and intrigue with an oddly definitive ending. In a film filled with questions, doubts and uncertainties, it feels completely out of place and emotionally untrue.\n\nJoffe&apos;s cast, at least, is unreservedly excellent. Kidman delivers her most fascinating performance in ages, one that&apos;s equal parts vulnerable and strong. Her Christine is very much a victim of her circumstances - and possibly her husband - but Kidman skilfully imbues her with a steely determination to reclaim her life and identity against very poor odds. Firth, too, is fantastic, shading both light and darkness into his trademark charm - enough to make us believe that he&apos;s the kind of man who could love and/or betray Christine with all of his heart.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame, then, that the final frames of the film don&apos;t live up to its promise or potential. Joffe has hit upon something truly unnerving with his premise: Christine&apos;s condition provides the ideal backdrop for either the perfect crime, or a love story for the ages. Before I Go To Sleep quite effectively teeters between the two extremes, as does Christine, but ultimately fails to follow through when the true depths of its darkness are revealed.",

      "reviewBody": "Watching the emotionally intense black comedy, &quot;Notes on a Scandal,&quot; you, too, may feel like its main character, Barbara, who reflects in one of her many voice-overs, &quot;The opera has begun and I have a front-row seat.&quot; Directed by Richard Eyre (&quot;Iris,&quot; &quot;Stage Beauty&quot; and the exceptional TV version of &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot; with Maggie Smith and Natasha Richardson), &quot;Notes&quot; bravely wades into modern-day Grand Guignol as the tension between its two female stars heads inevitably toward a showdown.\n\nPatrick (&quot;Closer&quot;) Marber&apos;s melodramatic screenplay cleverly makes use of Barbara&apos;s voice-overs as she scribbles in her diary and makes jaded, bitter observations about the world around her. Abundant voice-overs usually point toward shortcomings in a drama, but here they provide irony and serve to enhance the dialog. \n\nIn her juiciest role since &quot;Mrs Brown,&quot; Judi Dench brings an element of sympathy to Barbara, a closeted, self-loathing lesbian school teacher attracted to the new art teacher, Sheba, played by Cate Blanchett. Madly hoping to wrest the heterosexual Sheba from her husband and two children, one of whom has Down Syndrome, Barbara stumbles upon Sheba&apos;s sexual dalliance with a 15-year-old student. In a Machiavellian turn, Barbara hopes to manipulate Sheba by maintaining her secret . . . with strings attached. Need I add that all does not go well?\n\nIn fact, escalating histrionic fireworks ensue. Blanchett holds her own in this emotional and physical battle royal, capping her incredible year (2006) that also included outstanding performances in &quot;Babel&quot; and &quot;The Good German.&quot; As Sheba&apos;s husband, Richard, Bill Nighy also comes through with a powerhouse performance. The moody score by Philip Glass is icing on the cake.\n\nAt a tidy 92 minutes, &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot; is highly concentrated and vivid. The recently announced Golden Globe nominations include Dench, Blanchett and Marber, so we can expect Oscar nods as well.",

I think those who wrote the screenplay did a great job at portraying the harsh conditions of healthcare workers in the 90s/ early 2000s. However, the characters were underdeveloped, which was an absolute shame because I was left with so many questions.\n\nThey spent a lot of screen time building Amy and Charles&apos;s friendship, but not enough time giving us an idea of why Charle and Amy were the way they were. Why was Amy a single mother? Why did Charles keep getting hired with such a sketchy background? Why was the hospital covering for him? These questions are never answered and it made me wonder how much of this movie was real.\n\nDon&apos;t worry, all of those answers are easily googlable, but I feel like if those questions were given answers in the movie, I would have been much more invested. I felt like it was wasting Jessica and Eddie&apos;s talent by not diving into their characters more because the acting is so good.\n\nLike when Amy is starting to get suspicious of Charles, even though Charles&apos;s behavior doesn&apos;t change, I was scared of him. Amy&apos;s fear displays enough for the audience but hides enough to protect herself from Charles, making you terrified for her and creeped out by Charles. Which screws with your head because Charles&apos;s behavior doesn&apos;t change. He&apos;s still as sweet as he always was, but instead of finding it charming as you did at the beginning of the movie, you slowly start finding it creepy.\n\nPerhaps if this movie was a miniseries, I would have liked it more since it wouldn&apos;t have left so much of the real story out. As a movie, it just glossed over too much. That being said, if you&apos;re interested in the case of Charles Cullen and enjoy a great performance, you&apos;ll enjoy this movie.",

Jonah tries his best for some sprinkle of horror, everytime he&apos;s on screen, he&apos;d make sure you feel uncomfortable. Loved this movie for particularly the characters. The brother sister love is all over the movie.\n\nIt&apos;s not particularly horror, it&apos;s dark and depressing along with some gore elements sprinkled on top. Wait for the first half an hour for the character development and it takes off and never feels like a drag. No jump scare, wonderfully shot and the background score beautifully compliments the gore nature.\n\nI&apos;d recommend this movie wholeheartedly to everyone and would rate it a solid 8/10.",

After an unfortunate accident, he&apos;s left paralyzed from the neck down. After so many years he decides that he&apos;s had enough and wants to attempt suicide. As he tries to find the right person to help him, we get to meet so many great characters played by many great actors/actresses. From his family to his friends, you get this emotional bond between everyone and it really makes for a real powerhouse. You will believe Bardem is paralyzed, it&apos;s so effective. He makes it seem so realistic from beginning to end. This film has a very deep and dark meaning that anyone could feel for. It&apos;ll make you cry, it&apos;ll make you laugh and it will leave you in silence. If your a fan of Javier Bardem, or your a fan of a good and solid piece of art, do your self a favor and see this movie.",

Viggo Mortensen is a charismatic and very persuasive actor and talented man. Omar Sharif, &quot;Let in the light&quot;...  the scene at Wounded Knee is thought provoking.  Hidalgo is one I would recommend highly. I do not see how a mustang from America could have any chance though in such a race.  It would be unaccustomed to the new climate, and could possibly get sick and die just from the  change of environment. It would be racing against horses who have been  on these sands all their lives... it would be at a great disadvantage.  Remember the movie Lucas? Where at the end he finally gets to play football and nearly gets killed? Reminds me of those kind of odds.\n\nThis movie has many subtleties that go unspoken that are the signature of a great film.  I&apos;d like to point one out.\n\n1. The amount of the purse is unspoken until halfway thru, which leaves the mind open to experience beyond the material aspect.\n\nI love the goat herder whose punishment for stealing milk is to work for the American. We see objectively thru the eyes of Frank the positives and negatives that arise from different cultures, including our own.. and this honest experience, gives the film great character.\n\nOverall a very enjoyable film. I give this film a 8/10",

The result is a story you can connect with.\n\nExcellent film.",

      "reviewBody": "An ex-girlfriend talked me into seeing this movie, and I am happy she did. In my opinion, John Travolta deserved at least a nomination for an Oscar here, if not the award itself. The story was decent, but the performances of Travolta, Forest Whitaker, Robert Duvall, and Kyra Sedgwick made me care about what was happening on the screen. By no means is this a romantic comedy. It&apos;s romantic, probably the most romantic film I have seen in a long time. The reason for that is simple...it&apos;s real. In most movies you see the main characters sleep together within a day at the most, which rarely happens with two people who are really in love. True love has to take time and effort, which is exactly what you see here. Travolta&apos;s George is patient, but not because he wants to be. If you&apos;re a romantic at heart you will understand and relate to him, and you will hope for his success as you would for your own. Without giving anything away, I will tell you that the ending is sad, but also heartwarming. George has his &quot;experience&quot; for no other reason than to suggest what we as humans can become. Phenomenon is a story about our potential, the good and bad things that can happen to us if we achieve it. We could only be so lucky, and watching the movie is a good start. I give it 8 out of 10 stars.",

      "reviewBody": "The Dig (2021) was directed by Simon Stone. It stars Carey Mulligan as Edith Pretty. Mrs. Pretty is a widow who lives on a large estate. She is convinced that there&apos;s something of archeological significance on her property. She employ Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to excavate one of the burial mounds. Brown is a skilled and experienced excavator, but he has no formal academic training. The result of his efforts can now be seen in the British Museum.\n\nThis could have been a great movie, if director Stone had just worked with what actually happened. Naturally, staff of the local museum wanted to direct the excavation, as did staff of the British museum. There was an inquest to decide the ownership of the find. World War II was (literally) about to begin. A perfect 90-minute movie. However, it ended up being a less-than-perfect 105 minute movie.\n\nThat&apos;s because director Stone brings in a (fictitious) cousin of Mrs. Pretty and a beautiful young female archeologist married to a stodgy , unromantic male archeologist. (Guess where that goes?) The inquest--an absolutely essential scene about who owns the find--is botched. You have to work backwards to figure out what happened. Worst of all, you never see the dramatic results of the excavation. You can see them in the British Museum, or online, or on a postcard. However, you don&apos;t see them in the movie. (Maybe the British Museum didn&apos;t like the movie, and refused to give permission.)\n\nAll in all, what could have been an excellent movie turned out to be pretty good movie. It&apos;s worth seeing as long as you don&apos;t expect great things. It works well on the small screen. The Dig has a pretty good rating of 7.3. I agreed, and rated it 7.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was unnecessary once again. I get it. These characters are fun characters and people like watching them interact but i just once again feel like there was nothing to be said once again.\n\nThe glaring issue is this movie is also too long. 2 and a half hours! That is 5 times the run time of a single episode of the original series. That is a big jump and i don&apos;t think it works especially when then story isn&apos;t there to support the long run time.\n\nI actually found this movie slightly funnier than the previous but only by a slight margin. But i just couldn&apos;t get past the blah-ness.\n\nKim Cattrall is great as always but why she is also great is she&apos;s the only thing stopping them making a third movie, so good on her. They would keep making them because like i said people love these characters, i do too but i don&apos;t want to see them just like flounder around the screen not growing or developing. I said it in the last review that these characters have plateaued. They have reached their end and big surprise they ended once again where we started with them.\n\nI do want to mention the start of this movie because it was the strangest thing id seen all week, Liza Minelli singing Single Ladies. That maybe even be enough to make the film watchable.",

      "reviewBody": "I will admit there have been some romantic comedies I have not liked, and others I have. One thing for certain though, I adore Splash! It is a beautiful, charming and sweet romantic comedy that has quickly become a favourite of mine. For instance the whole film is beautifully shot, with lovely cinematography and stunning underwater sequences. Plus New York looks absolutely gorgeous here.\n\nThe music is also delightful. The song in the end credits was so beautiful, I nearly cried. Maybe it was also to do with how it is sung; the vocals were sublime, and never spoiled the mood of the song. The script is funny and touching, more the latter than the former, but who cares? There are still some funny parts of the movie. The direction from Ron Howard was secure and focused throughout.\n\nThere were so many charming scenes in Splash! The ending certainly was exactly that, and a bit of a tear jerker as well. Another charming scene that springs to mind was the ice skating scene. Not only how it was filmed, but also the music featured. A perfect choice of music for that particular scene, the Skaters Waltz. I also thought that the movie&apos;s length was perfect, and the pacing was just fine.\n\nAnd I can&apos;t write this review without mentioning the performances. Every single person did a superb job. Tom Hanks is charismatic and likable enough and was perfectly cast as Allan Bauer, a successful businessman who falls in love with a beautiful mermaid named Maddison. Speaking of Maddison, didn&apos;t Daryl Hannah look gorgeous here? She is a generally ignored actress, and she was positively charming. Eugene Levy plays a sort of bad guy, and he is funny as well as detestable. However, the film&apos;s humour comes from the late John Candy who is hilarious as Allan&apos;s brother.\n\nAll in all, I adore this movie. Out of all the romantic comedies I have seen, this has to be the most charming and possibly irresistible. I have been vocal before about not trying to take IMDb ratings to heart, but 6.2 is too low for this movie. It does deserve a higher rating than that. While not the best movie ever made, it is certainly one of my all time favourite movies for a number of reasons. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

If you like movies like the Evil Dead trilogy, Last House on the Left, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you will love this movie. The acting is surprisingly good for a bunch of nobodies, the story is very well developed (even a few really funny jokes, always good in horror), and the gore is INCREDIBLE! For those of you that miss the extreme gore of the 70s and early 80s, you will not want to miss this film. If you like absurd, black humor, you might also enjoy it a lot. And if you want a change from the standard slasher in the woods as the villain, definitely check this out. I&apos;m predicting this will be the best horror movie of the year."

I would have given it 10 stars except for a poorly written character trait implied in Michael Cain&apos;s &quot;Fred Ballinger&quot; to appeal to the gay community for God knows what reason. It doesn&apos;t fit into the character&apos;s personality or lifestyle at all, and so it made no sense and was purely gratuitous.\n\nAside from that issue, and the fact that the movie begins with a female singer (Maria Letizia Gorga) who is so talent-less, I have to mute the remote until she is finished, I found this movie to be a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, combining sights, sounds and thoughts in a totally original fashion, and takes place in a setting I can&apos;t recall ever seeing in any other motion picture. In contrast to the opening singer, the last singer (Sumi Jo) is &quot;extremely&quot; talented.\n\nThe acting is flawless from all involved, as is the casting, sets, editing, and most of all: &apos;the music&apos;. I have since purchased the blu-ray of this film, and have watched it more times than I&apos;d care to admit, and I&apos;ve never been able to control my emotions at the very end with the voice of an angel soprano singing her heart out to a song that not only should have been nominated for an Oscar (it was), but should have won it hands down. &apos;Simple Song #3&apos;\n\nIf you&apos;re an action addict, this film isn&apos;t for you. However, if you like beautiful scenery, music, and talent from all involved, you may like this film as much as I did: One of my top ten favorites."

      "reviewBody": "In all honesty, the plot is awfully muddled I couldn&apos;t even figure out what it is about, and it keeps going off at a tangent frequently with all its twists and turns until it becomes almost entirely obfuscated by the end. But seeing whip pans, dolly-tracking shots, overheads of perfectly placed props and profile shots among others that would later become Wes Anderson&apos;s visual trademarks is oddly satisfying and special in its own way. Sure they seem half-ripe and lacking in the tantalizing aesthetic quality that define the look of Anderson&apos;s films, but they are all there and as effectively and perfectly employed as in the auteur&apos;s most acclaimed efforts. And the same can be said about the hodgepodge of evocative music choices. Madcap and slapstick moments are present as well. What truly piqued my attention, and gripped me throughout the hour-and-half runtime, are the warmth of friendship between the lead duo (played by Luke and Owen Wilson) and spirit of camaraderie between the three pals that, alongside the plotline revolving around Anthony&apos;s romance with a hotel chambermaid, give the movie a feel that&apos;s at once tender, free-wheeling and delightfully charming tending to make one think of John Hughes. Whilst the attempts at making a caper story with a light-hearted approach are worthy of appreciation, I think it&apos;s fair to say that it is the weakest link here. Still, Bottle Rocket is a small-scale joyride and a confident debut for one of the most idiosyncratic filmmakers working today.",

      "name": "Arguably the best of the &quot;Halloween&quot; sequels, &quot;H20: Twenty Years Later&quot; serves as the wonderful book-end to the story, offering a satisfying and entertaining conclusion.",
      "reviewBody": "Ah, the mid-to-late 1990&apos;s... sort-of a rebirth of horror in a way. After all, the period from 1990 to about 1995 was wholly and decidedly a relatively murky period for the genre, with quality releases being very few and far between. Audiences were tiring of the holdover 80&apos;s slasher flicks and ho-hum ghost stories, with really only a handful of stand-out creep-shows to keep horror fans satiated. With so few quality-choices (notably the mini-series &quot;It&quot; from the book by Stephen King and the wonderful thriller &quot;Candyman&quot; from the stories of Clive Barker), it was no wonder that the early 90&apos;s were considered a &quot;dead&quot; period.\n\nThen, &quot;Scream&quot; happened and changed everything. It proved that not only could horror be widely appealing at the hands of gifted writers and quality filmmakers, but also showed that the old tropes and clichés could be &quot;hip&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; again when handled with care and a degree of nostalgic love.\n\nSo, it should come as no shock that after the colossal misfire that was the previous film (&quot;The Curse of Michael Myers&quot;), the &quot;Halloween&quot; series got a new lease on life with a post-&quot;Scream&quot; sensibility in this 1998 release- &quot;Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later.&quot; A minor degree of self-awareness, a focus on modern teenage and young adult culture and a fun blast from the past by way of original star Jamie Lee Curtis made the series relevant and modern in a way that both worked to re-invigorate interest and also pay homage to the series origins.\n\nThe film was lovingly crafted to serve as a book-end to the original, cleverly taking advantage of being released on the twentieth anniversary of the John Carpenter classic as part of it&apos;s schtick. It was built up as the &quot;Halloween&quot; to end all &quot;Halloween&apos;s&quot;... A &quot;Halloween&quot; for the modern era. A &quot;Halloween&quot; for the sharp and post-modern 90&apos;s crowd. And a &quot;Halloween&quot; that honored the long- beloved roots of the series.\n\nDirected by Steve Miner, the film revolves around Jamie Lee Curtis&apos; Laurie Strode, now living as a teacher under a false name. Still haunted by nightmares of her murderous sibling Michael Myers, Laurie is trying her hardest to move on. But when her brother comes calling, the stakes are set for a final and apocalyptic battle from which only one can emerge alive.\n\nThe success of the film really falls onto its clear adoration of the original and the desire to &quot;evolve&quot; and &quot;complete&quot; the story that it started in a new and fresh way. You can feel the love for that film oozing in virtually every scene here, with many subtle homages and call-backs. Yet it also builds and evolves the franchise in a way that previous films hadn&apos;t. Whereas prior sequels truly did feel like they were simply trying to re-create the magic of the original to increasingly diminishing results, &quot;H20&quot; actually has the guts to say &quot;No, the best way to pay tribute to the origin of the series is to make homage and continue the story, but allow it to change with the times.&quot; A huge part of that is the result of that late-90&apos;s self-aware mindset popularized by other films, and I think it works wonders. There are numerous levels of subversion that make you second-guess where it&apos;s all leading, there&apos;s plenty of banter and humor that satisfies the audience, and it also makes the wise move to make all the characters likable... nobody here really has their own agenda as so many other slasher-sequels have done with their characters.\n\nMiner&apos;s direction is strong, with a keen sense of scope, atmosphere and composition. He finds just the right balance between old- fashioned cinematography and 90&apos;s era aesthetics, giving the film a unique tone and visual palate that both compliments and contrasts with the Carpenter original.\n\nPerformances are uniformly strong for the material. Curtis is a joy in her returning role, giving Laurie a grand sense of pathos but also a drive to finally face her fears. Supporting roles by the likes of Josh Hartnett, Adam Arkin and even rapper LL Cool J round out a likable and believable cast. And there&apos;s no sore thumbs to be found. Also of note is voice-over artist Tom Kane, who perfectly re- creates the brilliant dialog of the late Donald Pleasance in a wonderful opening sequence. (Also, keep your eyes peeled for future superstar Joseph Gordon- Levitt in a small role in the opening sequence!)\n\nShould I have to address any negatives, I would definitely have to dock some slight points for a frankly shaky first act, which does fall back on the old tropes and clichés a bit too much. It just feels contrary to the much stronger second and third acts of the film, and it doesn&apos;t do much to subvert expectations or built on the legacy of the series. I also take some slight issue with the film&apos;s at times break-neck pace... it&apos;s already a fairly short film, and it rushes a bit too much for everything to really set in.\n\nStill, those flaws being stated, I can&apos;t help but feel that for my money, this is the best of the &quot;Halloween&quot; sequels. It built off of what came before, served as a loving tribute and also book-ended the series with what was at the time built up to be the final entry in the series. To me, the &quot;Halloween&quot; franchise is a trilogy- Carpenter&apos;s &quot;Halloween&quot;, it&apos;s first sequel &quot;Halloween II&quot; and this film, &quot;H20.&quot; Everything else to me is pure fan-fiction.\n\nI give &quot;Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later&quot; a strong 8 out of 10 as a horror fan and in particular as a fan of the franchise. Definitely worth seeing. (It&apos;s follow-up &quot;Resurrection&quot;... not so much.)",

I&apos;ll watch anything but I&apos;ve seen enough to know the dire ones (well, we all have our own opinions).\n\nI really enjoyed this film. Maybe it is because I expected it to be really awful. Maybe I got seduced by the good cast. Or I really am a secret girly girl and just thought all the shopping was fabulous.\n\nBut seriously, how did this get _that_bad an IMDb rating? I mean, I actually thought it was better than the Devil Wears Prada, which I thought was a bit of a let down. OK, the script is not original but it doesn&apos;t contain any big clangers and it doesn&apos;t try to hard. There is no wooden acting. No moments of cringe worthy awfulness, and some good cast chemistry. No, if you want to see a bad big-budget rom-com I still maintain Wimbledon is awful. Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst looked completely indifferent to one another.\n\nAs for being disappointed about books. Sheesh. If you love a book never go see a movie (e.g. Atonement) or accept it is going to be completely different.\n\nConfessions is utterly predictable, but the characters and actors are kooky in a lovable non-Oscar lusting way. Its like cheap chocolate-you know it has hardly any rich content but you keep going back.\n\nF*** it. I really like this movie. Not quite as much as Fight Club or Dawn of the Dead, but its moving up there. Seriously.\n\nNow if only they&apos;d do a sequel involving Christina Ricci and a load of blood...",

Dumbo is absolutely adorable and steals every single scene he is in and the flying parts of the movie are absolutely gorgeous and magical. the baby mine scene though not as emotional as it was in the animated movie is done beautifully here and it still made me tear up a little bit. the pink elephants on parade scene was absolutely brilliant and in my opinion was one of the better scenes in the entire movie. overall despite all the flaws I really enjoyed Dumbo and would watch it again.",

Nowadays, we are becoming more and more guided by the marketing that goes behind the movies, to realize when we actually go see them that we are often left unsatisfied.\n\nFelon is a movie about a man who is working hard to create a life for himself and his family, he has worked hard to establish his own business and feels as though he is finally ready to start reaping the fruits of his labour. Then, life brings a unexpected twist and he finds himself in prison. From this point on, we see transformations of a man who is forced into a new world where he has no control.\n\nThis movie is a great glimpse of the extreme conditions that the American correctional system can create. It also displays very well how people can get corrupted by power. All the actors in this movie shine and portray perfectly their characters. The story is very well told and by the end of the movie, you are left reflecting on how the correctional system has so many flaws and how it drives people to become their worst, both as inmates and as guards. However, the film also shows that even in these circumstances, there are great acts of humanity and compassion.\n\nA very good movie, definitely worth the watch. 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Killer Joe is a roller-coaster of a movie. At first it seems like a dark comedy, then a crime drama plot starts to uncover, and by the end it becomes downright terrifying. I&apos;m a sucker for these kinds of movies and Killer Joe absolutely nails everything it goes for. This kind of story couldn&apos;t be pulled off without the right director. Thankfully William Friedkin knocks it out of the park. You can smell the white trash emanating from the screen. Every detail of every action is given the right amount of attention; every shot has purpose. Not one second is gone to waste. And in order for a story like this to truly resonate you&apos;d need competent actors, and I don&apos;t think you could find a more perfect cast for Killer Joe if you tried. McConaughey is absolutely mesmerizing as this badass detective who&apos;s a hit-man on the side. The story revolves around a trailer trash family and their plan to exploit an insurance policy on the husband&apos;s ex-wife because the son got wrapped up in a bad drug deal, so they hire Killer Joe to do the job. Little do they know, Killer Joe does not f*ck around. \n\nIt&apos;s a graphic movie but it&apos;s not gratuitous. There&apos;s a reason for everything that is shown. And the narrative slowly builds to an explosive climax that leaves you flabbergasted. Seriously, the final scene in this movie which is about 10 minutes long, is absolutely phenomenal. Shocking, riveting, unsettling. Matthew McConaughey is downright villainous in this role. It&apos;s hard to call him a &quot;villain&quot; because he&apos;s straightforward in his motivations, much like it&apos;s hard to call the family the &quot;heroes&quot; because they&apos;re a bunch of moronic assholes, except the daughter who just doesn&apos;t know any better. The line between good and evil is blurred to the point of nonexistence, with Joe epitomizing this duality being the half detective half gun-for-hire hard-ass that he is. It&apos;s quite poetic, really. The characters in this movie are scum, and they all get what&apos;s coming to them.\n\nKiller Joe is a lot of things, but one thing it&apos;s not is scatterbrained. It&apos;s entirely focused and cohesive. All the genres it glosses over fit right into this depraved story arc, and it grips you to the screen from beginning to end. This movie certainly isn&apos;t for everyone, but if you can stomach Killer Joe, you won&apos;t soon forget it.",

I&apos;d been prolonging until I find a non-blockbuster movie that can really caught me deeply and The Kings of Summer happened to be the one.\n\nThe acting in this movie is basically original, starring Nick Robinson who played Joe perfectly well as a fifteen year-old desperately wanting to get out of his dad&apos;s house under his rules just like a typical teenager. Then there&apos;s his best friend, Gabriel Basso who played as Patrick who loves his parents but also desperately wanting to get out of their house because of how their parents treat him as a child. Moises Arias as Biaggio, who I think really suits for the role of a physically small friend of both of them who appeared out of nowhere and could really get things funny because he&apos;s that lovable and warm. Joe&apos;s dad, Nick Offerman as Frank, played a great grumpy father who gets mad and cranky easily in this movie and then there&apos;s Erin Moriarty as Kelly, which plays the girl who Joe had a crush on. \n\nThe movie at first started just like any ordinary drama movie, but the various shots and angles made it look pretty smart in the beginning. As you watch longer, the movie started getting interesting to where it&apos;s going, although you can really guess what will happen next. The Kings of Summer with its &quot;Into The Wild&quot; theme is packed with humor and a bunch of emotional feeling will be involved throughout the movie. Another plus point for this movie is the selection of songs in the background or soundtracks, how each song suits perfectly well based on the actions the characters were doing which really built up my point of view towards the movie. \n\nWhat caught me the most is how the movie is directed and made it as if he really wants us to feel to be like each one of the character involved there. The shots on the scenery and &quot;wild&quot; views in the forest really succeeded on making me re-think and went deeper about how there&apos;s more to the movie than what I&apos;ve actually seen. The movie does have some really cliché teenager scenes, however, I like how it stays original and remain unpretentious by showing that there&apos;s a big chance that conflicts may happen between friends and families but then in the end you will always come back to them, by not having all the cheesy fights nor a corny truce. It sticks to reality and shows people that it is truly what it is.\n\nNot considering how old you are, I really recommend you to watch this movie with anyone for you&apos;re about to feel that youth blood pumping down your streams and actually get something out of it. Praise for Jordan Vogt-Roberts for making this movie as perfect, my eyes were glistening right at the very last scene of the movie and at the same time drawing a smile on my face.",

Even if his heyday was a good half-century ago, his actions during one of Hollywood&apos;s very darkest periods still have tremendous impact even today. Especially today, for that matter.\n\nSome quick background. You may recall that in World War II, the US and the Soviets were allies but that after the war we became distrustful adversaries. This time was known as the Cold War – since the two countries didn&apos;t fight one another – and really ended only in the late 1980s. Prior to the end of WW II, many Americans joined the Communist Party as a way to fight the rise of Fascism in Europe. After the war, current and former members of the Party were looked upon as pariahs of the highest order. Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston) was one of these pariahs. It didn&apos;t help that he actively tried to rally technical workers on film sets (grips, lighting and sound technicians) to strike for higher pay. Unionizing was seen as a bad thing, despite the gains it had achieved for American workers earlier in the century.\n\nTrumbo&apos;s membership in the Party wasn&apos;t a big deal at first, but then gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren), who wielded an enormous amount of power in Hollywood, took it as a personal affront and used her column (and weekly appearance in newsreels) to denounce Communism in general and Trumbo in particular. Kicking the whole scandal into high gear was a little-known congressional group – the House Un-American Activities Committee. These guys tried to rout out Commies from Hollywood (which it saw as holding a lot of sway over Americans, much more so than today) by calling a group of known or suspected Communists to Washington for sworn testimony. These men were known as the Hollywood Ten. Trumbo was one of them, and he refused to tell the committee the names of anyone else who was or who could be a Communist. He, like his fellow Ten members, was found in contempt. Later, someone not in the group did name Trumbo, and he was put in prison for a full year.\n\nWhen he got out, no one would hire him (or any of the others in the Ten). Except for King Brothers Studio, which couldn&apos;t pay him much. But Trumbo worked fast as both a writer of original stuff and a fixer of existing scripts. The Kings loved him. So much so that the others in the Ten were offered jobs (for no credit, same as Trumbo) working as script doctors. During this time, Trumbo also got work from some friendly sorts in the business by selling them a script but not taking on-screen credit; the credit typically went to a fictitious person, or to a willing accomplice – known as a front. Through this method, Trumbo won two writing Oscars – although no one knew it at the time.\n\nDalton Trumbo fought for himself, his fellow writers, and for anyone for whom the Bill of Rights holds any meaning. He reasoned that if people could be silenced for political beliefs, then anyone could be silenced for any reason. This is, unfortunately, still true today. And although he didn&apos;t receive credit at the time, Trumbo was awarded his Oscars eventually (one posthumously). He&apos;s recognized as being one of the very greatest screenwriters the world has ever known. The movie does a terrific job describing Trumbo&apos;s struggles – and that of his family: his wife Cleo (Diane Lane) and his three doting children. The toll that his stance took on them was noticeable to everyone except for Trumbo himself.\n\nCranston turns in what was an Oscar-nominated performance, but his was not the only one of note. Lane is superb as his suffering, strong better half. Elle Fanning, as his eldest daughter, is also a standout, as are John Goodman (as Frank King) and Alan Tudyk (as writer Ian McLellan Hunter). Spellbinding from start to finish, and all screenwriters owe Trumbo a huge debt of gratitude for his long struggle on their behalf.",

      "reviewBody": "I admit that I was hesitant about seeing &quot;The Invasion&quot; after reading some poor reviews and coming to this message board. I also was leery after learning that part of it was re-shot by different directors which is usually a very bad sign. Plus the fact that they give Kidman a kid in this film had me leery for I often grow weary of female leads in suspense/action/horror films having to protect children instead of other adults like male leads do especially if the kids are annoying.\n\nSo, I almost didn&apos;t see &quot;The Invasion&quot; after reading and hearing all of the complaints about no plot, no real character development, bad acting and poor directing/editing.\n\nYet, I finally agreed to just go with my gut and take a chance on a matinée show of &quot;The Invasion.&quot; Boy, am I glad that I did, not only because I did not have to pay the outrageous full price of ten bucks but I actually liked this film.\n\nDespite what some are saying this film does have a plot. People are actually doing things that lead to other plot points like the whole deal with Veronica Cartwright&apos;s character and Kidman&apos;s character leaving her son with the ex-husband. These two story lines lead to important discoveries and actions that happen later on in the film.\n\nAlso, there is character development. Kidman&apos;s character does develop because she&apos;s forced to change in order to survive and to protect herself and her son. The warm relationship between Kidman&apos;s character and her son and Ben also is established.\n\nSo beyond these relationships do we really need to dwell on the other characters for too long? After all this is a plot driven movie not a character driven movie. Besides, if they had taken time to thoroughly get into everyone else&apos;s back story people would be whining about the movie being too long. But I digress.\n\nAlso, I thought that all of the actors did a good job especially Kidman. She showed good range from being a caring psychiatrist, to a loving mother to a terrified woman to a desperate mother who would do anything to protect her child. I also like the mood and tone of this film. Granted the Pod People in the 1956 and 1978 versions were a tad bit creepier but I liked this film better than the 1978 version overall and I didn&apos;t miss that crazy scream. However, the 1956 version is definitely a classic.\n\nSure &quot;The Invasion&quot; is not perfect and it has it flaws and I feel that the studio probably should have left the original version alone. After all, the majority of the film is stronger than the last half which is obviously where the re-shoots took place. Still despite the unnecessary out of order time cuts, and a tad too many car crashes, the film still worked for me. I was definitely entertained.\n\nNow that&apos;s saying a lot especially since I went in with low expectations."

      "name": "It&apos;s a Shame the Final Adventure Was No More than a Flashy Action Film",
      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m conflicted in my opinion of the final adventure of the Next Generation crew. I can see why a lot the fan community slam the film but I can&apos;t help but find some positive aspects in the movie. I agree that it&apos;s a good thing NEMESIS was the final film in the series, as the filmmakers appear to have given up recapturing the essence of the series years before and were more interested in putting out blockbuster hopefuls. The film opens with the marriage of Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) to Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis), but the festivities are soon put on hold when the Enterprise-E locates a prototype android identical to Data scattered in pieces on a nearby planet. As the android (dubbed B-4) is reassembled, the Enterprise is dispatched to Romulus where the Remans have risen up against the Romulans and their leader apparently seeks to find peace with the Federation. The Remans are led by a clone of Captain Picard named Shinzon (Tom Hardy), originally bred as a weapon against Starfleet but eventually relegated to the dilithium mines of Remus. Picard struggles with the feeling that a portion of his identity was stolen as the Enterprise is discovers that Shinzon&apos;s intentions are not those of peace, but of destruction.\n\nAs has been the case with all of the Next Generation movies (with the exception of INSURRECTION), this film is visually beautiful. The CGI effects are at their peak and the production design of Herman Zimmerman continues to blow me away. I loved the design of the Remans: part Romulan, part vampire. It was some of the best makeup design in the series since the Borg were redesigned for FIRST CONTACT. The filmmakers have even learned from their mistakes of the last film and used a cinematographer who gave the film a wonderful cinematic feel, as opposed to the flat television lighting they&apos;d regressed to before. Nothing about the film&apos;s visual style disappoints, but the same can&apos;t be said for the story. Most of the earlier films retained the depth of the series, but NEMESIS really is nothing more than a flashy action pic. For proof, you need to look no further than the entire last half of the film. There is some weak subtext to the story but the entire second hour is drawn out battle leading to the climactic confrontation between Picard and Shinzon about the enemy ship.\n\nAs seems to be the norm with all of the Next Generation movies, Picard and Data are the focal points here. The other crew members are usually given plenty of their own to do, but not here. A lot of the crew members are underused and I&apos;m sure they weren&apos;t happy about being background players in their final feature film. Patrick Stewart is certainly the strongest member of the cast and carries most of the movie, and Brent Spiner is great as usual as Data (and B-4). I wish I had more positive things to say about Tom Hardy as Shinzon. He&apos;s a fantastic actor and has the skills to go face-to-face with Patrick Stewart (for those who doubt me, watch his screen test for the film). I just couldn&apos;t help but feel his character was too young and that really robbed me of any sense of danger from him. Had he been a bit more aged and worn, I might see him as a threat to Picard.\n\nI suppose the film is a fun action flick, but it&apos;s just a weak STAR TREK film. It&apos;s shallow story can&apos;t be saved by it&apos;s impressive effects, but I wish the crew had been given one more chance to do it right before calling it quits. It&apos;s an entertaining two hours but aside from a bittersweet ending there&apos;s nothing entirely memorable about it. Fans of the franchise will be polarized in their views on the film and non-fans might be able to stomach it as an action-packed sci-fi romp. One thing&apos;s for certain: it&apos;s not the best time spent with the crew of the Enterprise.",

Yes, we definitely liked this movie.\n\nAnd of course we&apos;re not sailors. We do not know the technical details of what to do or what not to do in sailing. Of course there were some logical problems when we asked &quot;wait, why did he do that?&quot; in some scenes - but this didn&apos;t bother us enormously.\n\nBut when I entered and read the reviews here, I confront with human ego, I-know-everything attitude of &quot;sailors&quot; here. Ego is interesting, don&apos;t get me wrong I do not criticize this. If this movie was about health &amp; illness and the main character was ill in a remote island and tries to heal himself, you should see my technical rant here as a health professional. Yes this is E.G.O., Everyone Got One.\n\nBut if you can pass ego, this is real nice movie showing the strong will and instinct of human being vs nature.

There are too much movies with repetitive stories so to see one with an interesting plot it gets my attention. It&apos;s a weird story, so if you don&apos;t like the bizarre (that&apos;s those with the negative reviews) then you should just not watch it, you will be disappointed. Vivarium is the kind of movie that makes me talk out loud during the viewing, what I would do if I was in that case and so on. The plot is intriguing, the decor very minimalistic but that definitely adds to the odd ambiance, the cast is very small but good. Once you&apos;re in the story you defintely want to know what the hell is happening and where they are going to? Maybe the end could have been a bit more elaborated but overal it&apos;s a movie that deserves a better rating, just for creativity alone.",

      "name": "A fanboy film that celebrates Kamal Hassan to the fullest extent!",
      "reviewBody": "The buildup and marketing to Lokesh Kanagaraj&apos;s Kamal Hassan starrer &quot;Vikram&quot; has been nothing short of all-encompassing, driven primarily by the fact that the 36-year old young director is yet to direct a sub-par movie, with &quot;Maanagaram (2017)&quot;, &quot;Kaithi (2019)&quot; and &quot;Master (2021)&quot;, all having been well-received by audiences. And the precocious storyteller delivers, with a mazy yet continuously engaging crime saga with resounding mass elevation sequences and enough emotional hooks to keep the audience invested.\n\n3-time National Award winner for Best Actor Kamal Hassan stars as a grieving father heartbroken at the loss of his son, who was a policeman investigating the burgeoning drug mafia in Chennai and who had, before his mysterious murder, uncovered a staggering cache of illegal drugs the syndicate safeguarded . Enter Fahadh Faasil, a black ops specialist charged with unraveling the mystery around the carnage unleashed by the cartel as a result. Vijay Sethupathi stars as the head honcho of the vicious and vengeful mafia operation and is first shown to the audience in one of the most intricately weaved, deliciously bonkers intro sequences for an antagonist in recent memory.\n\nIt is testament to Lokesh Kanagaraj&apos;s directorial genius that he manages to give his three lead actors enough room to develop their characters and build a connect with the viewers. If it is Sethupathi&apos;s quirky eccentricities that catch the eye, Fahadh&apos;s intensity weaves a subplot of its own while Kamal excels in the emotional sequences. Lokesh Kanagaraj had told us to rewatch his classic &quot;Kaithi (2019)&quot; before we went to theaters to watch &quot;Vikram&quot; and with good reason, with the two movies being intricately connected and seemingly leading up to an extensive LKU-A mouth-watering Lokesh Kanagaraj Universe! A fantastic cameo from superstar Suriya is the cherry on the cake, with the actor looking the most stylish and massy he has in years!\n\nThe director&apos;s penchant for crime thrillers, retro music and biryani continues to hold good for &quot;Vikram&quot; with Anirudh Ravichander&apos;s music rendering a soaring sheen to the narrative being built. The callbacks and references to old Kamal classics blend smoothly with the storytelling and are never jarring or contrived. The actor&apos;s phenomenal voice modulation and expressive eyes elevate even simple sequences to another level, especially his interactions with his toddler grandson.\n\nMaster stunt choreographer duo Anbariv continue the same rich vein of form they displayed in the KGF franchise, but this time sacrificing the larger canvas for more close-quarters, hand-to-hand combat in tight spaces. Girish Gangadharan&apos;s cinematographer is other-worldly as usual, soaking up the bone-crunching action in all its glory. Editor Philomin Raj also deserves praise for ensuring that a movie with a seemingly daunting 3 hour run-time is never boring at any stretch.\n\nWhile you might see many of the plot&apos;s twists coming, the visual grammar, treatment and picturization takes your breath away, nevertheless. &quot;Vikram&quot; is yet another endeavor from a superstar fanboy that pays rich dividends, along the lines of Prithviraj&apos;s Mohanlal tribute &quot;Lucifer (2019)&quot;, Karthik Subbaraj&apos;s Rajnikanth-starrer &quot;Pettah (2019)&quot; as well as Amal Neerad&apos;s ode to Mammootty, &quot;Bheeshma Parvam (2022)&quot;. Highly recommended! Long live the Lokesh Kanagaraj universe!",

Then, if they missed it at the theater, now then can buy this crucial information (but not until Nov. 21st).\n\nThis is nothing more than a fancy documentary. But you gave it a premier like a movie, ran it in movie theaters (with movie prices), held it for DVD release like a movie. What gives Al Gore?

However, Chris Pine is not Mel Gibson and the storytelling is not as engaging or as smooth.

The Outlaw King is certainly a quality production and good for an evenings entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "What is freedom?  How does one determine who is free?  In 1839, those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now.  Yet, the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations.\n\nThat is, in essence, what Steven Spielberg&apos;s gripping drama &quot;Amistad&quot; is about.  Through its various dramas, Spielberg presents a case about a group of Africans, who, after being seized from their home, were forced onto a ship and sent to the United States aboard &quot;La Amistad&quot;.  On their way there, the slaves, led by Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), rebelled, killing off part of the crew.  However, the ship was still directed towards the United States, where the Africans were brought to trial under murder.  \n\nIn the court, various factions claim ownership of the slaves, and therefore try to seize them away.  The United States government, led by President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne), and Secretary of State Secretary Forsyth (David Paymer), try to ship the Africans to Spain, where an 11 year old Isabella II (Anna Paquin) wants them back.  The two Spaniards who own &quot;La Amistad&quot; want the slaves for themselves.  The American ship that found the slaves also wants them.  In the midst of this are two abolitionists (Stellan Skaarsgard and Morgan Freeman), who want the slaves to be free.  They enlist the help of lawyer Matthew McConaughey, who tries to free them. Through various legal proceedings, the case appears before the Supreme Court, where it is argued by ex-President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins).\n\nThe film itself is a visual wonder.  Spielberg favorite Janusz Kaminski sets the film in a dark, somber mood when appropriate, and a visual setting when appropriate as well.  At times, the film is very slow, and very methodical. Spielberg is not at his finest here, the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag.  But Spielberg&apos;s finest work in the film, the opening scene, a scene of Cinque&apos;s family, and the brutal voyage of the slaves to America, is altogether stunning.  It is this emotional force that carries the film.  McConaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the Africans, Hopkins is sensational as the old Adams, Freeman is outstanding when used (Spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents), and the rest of the cast is stellar. The movie, however, belongs to Hounsou.  His emotional intensity is brilliant.  Spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on Hounsou, and the film&apos;s extraordinary power is simply captivating. The film is flawed, for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard.  But that doesn&apos;t matter.  The story is a gripping one, and one of extreme importance.  Kudos to Spielberg for finding it, finding the right men for the job, and letting the audience listen to the words of Cinque.  A good job all around.  ***1/2 out of 4, or an 8 out of 10."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;In The Mouth of Madness&quot; is one of John Carpenter&apos;s better flicks. It features the usually bland Sam Neill in a surprisingly good and likable performance, and is packed with oodles of intriguing concepts and spiffy details. The music is good (it was cowritten by Carpenter) and the movie has a great look. There are also lots and lots of ginchy make-up effects, and while some are better than others (the kid who turns into an old man looks like a kid wearing a Spencer&apos;s Gifts Old Man mask and fright wig), but the sheer abundance of them make this unique.\n\nNeill plays John Trent, a no-nonsense insurance investigator who loves his job and has disdain for most of humanity- but with a sense of humor. He&apos;s sent to find a missing mega-selling author Sutter Caine (Jurgen Prochnow, in a role that would have been kick-ass if played by Stephen King), whose books are a nation-wide craze. Trent ends up in Hobb&apos;s End, a town right out of Caine&apos;s books (literally) where the morbid tales of fiction are becoming reality.\n\nThe movie, although muddled in places, too repetitive (on purpose), and too reliant on flash forwards, has lots of things to say about the perception of reality and it interesting and entertaining.\n\nThe supporting cast is good: John Glover and David Warner are psychiatrists, a subdued Charleton Heston is a publisher, and Bernie &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; Casey is Trent&apos;s boss, but the highlight is Frances Bay as the sweet Mrs. Pickman. She provides the film&apos;s high points and ends up looking like something from the director&apos;s &quot;The Thing&quot;. The weak link in the cast is the leading lady, Julie Carmen, who delivers every line like she just chugged a case of Nyquil. In addition to her lousy acting, she&apos;s dressed in ugly outfits and has a kind of &quot;in-your-face&quot; ugliness. In one scene there is a special effects dummy head in place of Carmen&apos;s and the dummy head out-acts her.\n\nThis is not as great as &quot;The Thing&quot; but better than &quot;They Live&quot; as far as John Carpenter&apos;s paranoid, reality-bending flicks go, and is worth checking out."

      "reviewBody": "The Kennedy assassination was one of the defining moments of history, probably the most internationally shocking one until 9/11. Pablo Larraín&apos;s &quot;Jackie&quot; focuses on the widowed Jackie Kennedy during the few days after the assassination, as she tries to cement her late husband&apos;s legacy. I wasn&apos;t alive then, so I don&apos;t know what Jackie&apos;s voice sounded like, but Natalie Portman affects a breathy mid-Atlantic accent to play the stylish first lady. Quite an impressive performance.\n\nWe could make the argument that JFK didn&apos;t have much of a positive legacy, given his poor record on civil rights (upon which Johnson sought to improve) and an undeclared war on Cuba. Even so, the era was seen as the culmination of the possible. I recommend the movie.\n\nLarraín also directed 2012&apos;s &quot;No&quot;, about the TV campaign that led to Augusto Pinochet&apos;s defeat in the 1988 election.",

      "reviewBody": "I went into this movie tonight not expecting much based on the HORRIBLE reviews given to this movie on IMDb and critics reviews in today&apos;s paper. I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be another sweet movie about two male buddies that are learning to grow up. \n\nOwen Wilson was adorable and his character was not a loser. Dupree (I won&apos;t give away his real name because it surprises you when it comes up in the movie...) gives sage advice throughout the movie. In one scene is he standing in for Matt Dillon&apos;s character at a career day, in Molly&apos;s (Kate Hudson) 3-4? grade classroom. He tells the kids that some of them will go on to traditional or socially acceptable success, while some of them (pods, he calls them!) will &quot;float&quot; for a while, while they wait for the calling from the &quot;mother ship&quot; for their destined path in life. He says &quot;the pods that needed to hear this, did,&quot; and I laughed my butt off. His &quot;floating pod&quot; theory was hysterical and very accurate.\n\nIt sounds ridiculous, but it isn&apos;t. Dupree&apos;s character is consistent throughout as a lovable guy looking for his path. He&apos;s a smart, charismatic guy that makes lots of mistakes along the way. Of course the previews showed all the stupid humor (bathroom jokes, jacking off, etc) but it doesn&apos;t play as crazily over the top in the movie as it is edited for in previews. \n\nI think the movie was as fun as it was because of the great casting. No one else could have been Michael Douglas&apos; character (besides perhaps James Caan but he might have been too scary) and NO ONE could have done Dupree like Owen Wilson, because Dupree IS Owen Wilson. \n\nIf you&apos;re like me and you like Owen Wilson movies, you&apos;ll really enjoy this movie.\n\nPS: There is a (hush hush) cameo in this movie when you least expect it and you&apos;ll laugh.",

      "reviewBody": "In that time between summer blockbusters and the full-on Oscar blitz is time for Hollywood to take a breather. Sometimes the audience takes a breather too. And that isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing. Here we meet Becky Fuller, trying to make the jump from local to network news show producer. She is put in charge of an ailing morning program, and when told that it is on its last leg, she takes the novel and bizarre step of forcing well-respected television journalist Mike Pomeroy into the co-host position via a quirk of his contract. and thus they are off toward saving the show... A plot like this doesn&apos;t really have much in the way of surprises. What really matters is how well the characters are written and how well the actors play their respective parts. While none of the cast is terrible, standing out are a low-key Jeff Goldblum, playing a cynical network executive. While an over stated, loud performance would have sufficed, Goldblum plays it a pragmatic working guy. He gets in a few good zingers early on though. The other standout is Harrison Ford. While he hasn&apos;t had much success in the field, he is actually very good at comedy usually playing the straight man to what is going on around him. Here he plays the gruffly lovable curmudgeon pretty well. A significant part of the the plot is his character&apos;s personal growth. On the whole, Morning Glory isn&apos;t going to sweep any of the major awards, but it&apos;s a gentle way to pass two hours and get a few good laughs in the process.",

      "reviewBody": "...or maybe the villain is Sheldon Cooper gone evil...Because you couldn&apos;t do the kinds of things that the villain does in this film unless you have all kinds of coding skills and superuser privileges. But I digress.\n\nIt was actually pretty interesting to me.A lot of people complain about it not being scary or containing the essence of a horror film, and I think that&apos;s kind of the point. The cliches of horror are there to throw you off the scent - the real horror comes from these kids and the depths of violence and cruelty that they show themselves to be capable of. They experience horror in the form of a ghost haunting them as they skype and chat online, but any violence that goes on is nothing compared to what they do to each other as they&apos;re forced to reveal their own and each other&apos;s secrets.\n\nThat alone, to me, makes it worth watching seriously. And the film has a &quot;gimmick&quot; that demonstrates a command of realism that returns to the fundamental idea of the verite style, after so many hackneyed &quot;found footage&quot; films made that term meaningless. The same is true for the dialogue - it&apos;s not good, because it&apos;s realistic. The characters do dumb things because it&apos;s realistic. And anyway, the idea of characters doing dumb things is a staple of horror films and makes for good writing. Characters making smart choices does not a good horror film make.\n\nI&apos;d recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "Midnight Special is a modern day science fiction film with a very old school feel running through its veins. Jeff Nichols has made it no secret that classic sci-fi films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind are inspirations for his film however, I find the fact that his relationship with his own son was used as an inspiration too, much more intriguing.\n\nAlton (Jaeden Lieberher) is an eight-year-old boy who possesses otherworldly powers. When his father, Roy (Michael Shannon), takes his son and flees from a religious cult, they must travel across the country to an undisclosed location on a specific date, during which a celestial and possibly world-changing event may occur.\n\nMystery is a strong point for Midnight Special, the entire mystery surrounding Alton&apos;s powers, what will happen on that specific date and the reason a religious cult want him back, all playing a part in making the story such a captivating one. Then comes the film&apos;s climactic moment. We get answers, but they end up ruining some of the mystery that made what came before so good. Less is more definitely sprung to mind as it all unfolded.\n\nThe story, written by Jeff Nichols, is a very good one and at the heart of that story is a rather beautiful relationship between a father and son. It adds another layer to the film rather than it just being a standard story about people on the run, and as mentioned earlier, it really feels like a personal film from Nichols. Not saying that his son has special powers though, so don&apos;t think that.\n\nIn a rather short directorial career, Nichols has made quite a name for himself and Midnight Special should further his reputation. It&apos;s a very well made film but if there was one thing that stopped it from being great, it was the pacing. Unfortunately, this film dragged itself out through a few scenes and it really bugged me.\n\nI cannot fault the film for its performances mind. Michael Shannon possesses such a magnetic screen presence, you just can&apos;t take your eyes off him and Joel Edgerton certainly makes his presence felt, even if his role remains a little unexplained. Kirsten Dunst and Adam Driver offer good support and Jaeden Lieberher is rather good as Alton. \n\nIt may be that, in time, I appreciate Midnight Special more however, my initial experience warrants me to say that it&apos;s not the special film I was hoping for.",

Those who created Norbit did not set out to make a witty, comical masterpiece that made the viewers think and contemplate...this is a comedy. No one seems to understand it, be the long, winding and rather dull critical remarks on the movie bringing &apos;a new meaning to distasteful&apos; or something equally as yawn-worthy, what needs to be realized is that this is riddled with clichés and fun, comical satire. This is not meant to make one think, it exists because it must have been entertaining to make and it is funny. This is no Little Miss Sunshine, and it serves its purpose, I spent one hour and forty-two minutes without a decent thought in my head. Those humorless people who continue to bore us with their in depth reasoning for &apos;why this movie isn&apos;t good&apos; need to stop for a second and look at the plot and concept...this is not meant to be taken seriously.",

      "reviewBody": "The opening few minutes of Kurt Wimmer&apos;s Ultraviolet is a rip roaring, pulse pounding set up of action sequences and chases. Then the film calms down for a little breather until the next amazing fight sequence. \n\nFollowing a holocaust some humans have become Hemophages, a sub-species with enhanced physical abilities. Violet, must protect a nine-year-old boy who has been marked for death by the human government.\n\nIn the wake of 2005&apos;s disappointing Aeon Flux, underrated Kurt Wimmer director of Equilibrium (2002) writer of The Recruit (2003) and Salt (2010) set about creating an up-to-the-minute Sci-fi.However, after shooting wrapped Kurt left after being pressured to deliver less emotional PG-13 rated film. In turn, Ultraviolet was completely re-edited by the studio and apparently this marred the finished product significantly.\n\nActing wise, William Fichtner puts in an unusual performance, Sebastien Andrieu and Nick Chinlund both seem unsure what&apos;s going on. With an abundance of forgettable bad guys, Milla Jovovich excellently plays Violet who has enhanced speed, incredible stamina and acute intelligence. Her character at first seems very one dimensional as she plays her usual Resident Evil kick-ass self. But even in the short running time her character develops, you&apos;re given glimpses into here past, as she bonds with &apos;Six&apos; played well by Cameron Bright.\n\nThere&apos;s great effects, stunts and a thumping score. A lot of reviews have criticised the CGI usage, however, it&apos;s stylised, hyper-real and sleek. It&apos;s not meant to be faithful representation of a real world. Holograms, swords, a new invented language, gun-fighting and martial arts. It&apos;s science fiction entertainment, set in the 21st century, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nIt&apos;s fast, it&apos;s fun - Ultraviolet is an pleasing sci-fi action but possibly could have been so much more if Wimmer was allowed to deliver his cut."

      "reviewBody": "I wasn&apos;t going to review this film until I read the other reviews. But the way a large number of people so negatively react to this film is a testament to how powerful it really is, and perhaps says more about the film than those reviews themselves ever could.\n\nWe live in a world that hates the truth. And &quot;Eighth Grade&quot; is pure truth. The most remarkable thing about the film is how it refrains from dramatizing how young people today grow up and interact, and instead tries to simply show things how they are. You can argue how successful they were in this attempt, but I think they got it pretty close. And some things about growing up are timeless. While the technology may have changed, all of the things Kayla did in the film, I also did at that age. I also came from a broken home and background of trauma, and I was also not popular. One review said that you had to be a loser to like this film, and maybe there is more than a nugget of truth there. The kid who was head of the class in Grade 8 might have a tough time relating.\n\nThe film does very little to explain all this to the viewer, and does not make any attempt to show why Kayla is how she is. This is fascinating because that is exactly how our society, and in particular teen society, works: it is blind to why people are how they are, and simply ruthlessly sorts them into categories such as attractive/popular and ugly/unpopular. It seems that people who are used to going along with this way of thinking are puzzled and unsettled by the film.\n\nWhat &quot;Eighth Grade&quot; ultimately is, is a mirror. It simply reflects back to us what our world is. There is no editorialization. So when so many people are recoiling in horror from a mirror, what does that actually say?",

      "reviewBody": "From the opening shot of &quot;Nineteen Eighty Four&quot; the viewer is plunged right into the hellhole of Oceania and the ultimate totalitarian nightmare. Whilst the year 1984 may be long past us, the essential themes of George Orwell&apos;s best known work still remain as timely and as relevant as ever.\n\nWinston Smith (John Hurt) is a drone worker in the Bureau of Information, and his job is to edit the news in accordance with the needs of the governing Party (which is in continual, seemingly endless war with Eurasia and other opposing states).  He must also refer to the dictionary of Newsspeak, which is the government&apos;s language for the distribution of information.\n\nHe lives in a world where there is no escape from the authority of the government who regiment the every thought and deed of their subjects.  The Party is steadily working on a way to outlaw the concept of the family and the idea of conception.  This is done to eradicate Thoughtcrime and guarantee the worker&apos;s total devotion to the Party and its leader, Big Brother.\n\nWinston abides by this (recording his increasingly ambiguous thoughts about society in a hidden, handwritten diary) until he encounters Julia (Suzanna Hamilton), a strange young women with rebellious ideas, to whom he develops a powerful attraction.  But their passionate, forbidden relationship cannot escape the all-seeing eyes of Big Brother.....\n\nScreenwriter Jonathan Gems has a done a terrific job with the script.  He successfully translates Orwell&apos;s ideas to the screen with great clarity. Micheal Radford directs with subtlety around the greasy sets and crumbling locations (the picture was filmed in and around the very area in which Orwell set his novel).\n\nThe performances from the chief principals are very strong.  John Hurt is excellent as Winston, bringing a subtle and considerate approach to the character.  Particularly disturbing is his final scenes, as he becomes gaunt and disfigured through government torture.  Suzanna Hamilton is gentle and quirky as Julia and &quot;Rab C Nesbitt&quot; actor Gregor Fisher appears as Winston&apos;s ill-fated friend, Parsons.\n\nVeteran actor Richard Burton lends a cold charisma to government enforcer O&apos;Brien and he too excels in the film&apos;s final moments, as he coolly and sadistically tortures Winston, subjecting him to severe physical pain to subdue him, casually pulling a tooth out of his rotting mouth, then exposing him to the horrors of Room 101, all the while exhorting obedience to the Party and love to Big Brother. \n\nThe strong relevance of the concepts of &quot;Nineteen Eighty Four&quot; should not be underestimated.  Whilst the term &quot;Big Brother&quot; is now synonymous with the ridiculous &quot;reality&quot; TV shows of the same name, others like the Two Minutes Hate (in which the workers are coerced, through a two-minute broadcast, into hating the enemies of the state); the idea of a government waging a perpetual war to advocate &quot;peace&quot; (especially relevant in the aftermath of September 11) as well as the editing of news and the abuse of language in order to suit the needs of government and disguise its true agendas are ideas that are chillingly present in today&apos;s society.\n\nAll of this is powerful and thought-provoking stuff, and helps to make &quot;Nineteen Eighty Four&quot; an accurate and powerful rendering of a still very timely piece of work."

I&apos;m guessing you&apos;re familiar with it, not only because of countless movies being made about it, but because of the original story too. Or maybe you just heard about it. This takes a more fantastical turn for it and tries to make it as entertaining as possible.\n\nIt&apos;s not a classic or anything that will be remembered as a great movie. It can be an entertaining watch though, if you let it. The lead character is interesting enough and the origin story or the story in general is told decently enough. It&apos;s a family movie so don&apos;t expect it to be too violent or too extreme in some regards. Just take it for what it is and try to enjoy it",

      "reviewBody": "Wow, I guess there is SOME hope for video game adaptations. While not a direct translation of the Final Fantasy video game franchise, it is written by the series creator, whose name I cannot remember. On top of that, his video game company branched off into a film company (Square Pictures) just to go and make this movie. At least one can&apos;t complain about the handling of the material.\n\nBut the big question here is: Do these guys know anything about film-making? Maybe. Maybe not. Truth be told, they don&apos;t need to. The beauty of this movie is that it does something new. It blends the world of video game technology and storytelling with the art of film-making. It cuts corners on film-making, but its uniqueness makes up for it. I will admit that I&apos;m a gamer, so I appreciate what was attempted here. What we get out of this movie is an impressive display of what animators and video game technology can do together. I know there are other CGI movies out there, but, unless I am mistaken, they have all followed the over-the-top cartoony path. This is where Final Fantasy stands out. The animation is swelling with reality. From a technical standpoint, this is a gem, and a reason at the least to give it a rent.\n\nThe storyline is subject to much scrutiny though. It&apos;s not for everybody. This IS a film of Japanese origin, so anime fans will be right at home with it. For the mainstream audience, however, that remains to be decided. Although the script was revised to suit North American localization (and done very well might I add), it still is very Japanese in style, albeit with a bit less surrealism. It&apos;s fast-paced and a bit abstract at times, but it is coherent.\n\nIn the end, I would say that one should rent this just to see the technological achievement at the least. It&apos;s safe to say that all would agree with that point. Depending on the person, you may get into the storyline as well. Either way, you&apos;ll walk away with at least part of you satisfied.",

      "reviewBody": "Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean X3, The Ring, The Mexican) has an uncanny way of moving strange characters through bizarre plots while maintaining our interest and our empathy. THE WEATHER MAN was so poorly promoted when it hit the theaters that it seemed like it was going to be one of those asinine food throwing slapstick comedies instead of the very serious examination of contemporary life in the big cities, or even more about the struggle of a disillusioned man who cannot find a balance between business success and family/marital failure, it is. This viewer almost ignored it completely - until the DVD.\n\nDavid Spritz (Nicholas Cage) is a TV pawn the station uses as a weatherman: he is untrained as a meteorologist, skilled only be his TV persona success dependent on a created gag/tag line - the Nipper (the peak worst day in the forecast). His personal life is a mess, separated from a disconsolate wife Noreen (Hope Davis), distanced from his successful writer father Robert (Michael Caine) and on shaky territory with his two children - fat and sad Sully (Gemmenne de la Peña) and sweet but troubled pothead Mike (Nicholas Hoult). To make life worse his TV persona follows him into the streets of blustery Chicago where his viewers either seek autographs invading his privacy or throw food at him as the progenitor of the lousy cold weather. This polarized existence is invaded by an offer to become weatherman on Bryan Gumbel&apos;s Hello America show in New York (a career jump for which he longs for many reasons), serial confrontations with his father whom he emulates but always feels a failure, the finding that his father has lymphoma, the ridicule of fat Shelly at school, Mike&apos;s edgy involvement with his drug counselor Don (Gil Bellows), and Noreen&apos;s new live-in Russ (Michael Rispoli). How David meanders through this quagmire of dilemmas is the story and while it is not pretty, it is pungent.\n\nCage inhabits the strange role of David finding a way to make this loser with a short temper someone about whom we care. It is a tough assignment but Cage meets it on every level. Michael Caine provides some of the more eloquent moments in the film: his words of wisdom and view of life are the only grounded elements of the story. Likewise Hope Davis is fine as are the cameo roles of the children as sensitively played by de la Peña and Hoult. The subject of the film is tough and the excessive use of potty mouth language is overbearing and at times one wishes Verbinski would have edited some of the gross food slinging scenes.\n\nBut as an overall message movie there is much here to admire. It simply is not the mindless slapstick the posters and trailers would indicate. The PR folks on this one blew it. Worth your time and attention. Grady Harp",

      "name": "Bland action thriller that tries- but fails- to be the younger Bourne, no thanks to Taylor Lautner&apos;s hammy acting",
      "reviewBody": "Five minutes. That was how long it took before Taylor Lautner took his shirt off in his purportedly gritty action thriller &apos;Abduction&apos;- and depending on how you took to that fact, you may find yourself enjoying every minute of it or cringing in disbelief. Right from the start, this Taylor-made vehicle makes no excuses for being a breakout role for the &apos;Twilight&apos; star- after all, if Team Edward (or Robert Pattinson) can do it, then there&apos;s no reason why Team Jacob can&apos;t do likewise.\n\nNonetheless, it seems that Team Jacob should have just stayed in the woods of Forks, Washington, for this insipid Bourne-wannabe does him nor his fans no favours. Rather, (and we may be risking our life and limb by saying this) it only demonstrates his limitations as an actor, especially since he practically recycles the same angsty broody expression throughout the film that he had already put forth umpteen times in the &apos;Twilight&apos; movies. And no, being a teenager who discovers that the people you call &apos;mother&apos; and &apos;father&apos; aren&apos;t in fact your real parents isn&apos;t much of an excuse too. \n\nThat&apos;s the predicament Lautner&apos;s character Nathan finds himself in one day, after stumbling across a website with photos of missing children and using some software to approximate what one of those kids could look like as a teenager. Though that&apos;s the very premise of the movie, the least we expected was for debut feature film screenwriter Shawn Christensen to come up with a better lead in than just some stupid research assignment Nathan and his girl next door Karen (Lily Collins, daughter of singer Phil) was assigned to work together on. \n\nLogic and coherence are however too much evidently to demand, as one would have to suspend both to believe that Nathan is suddenly at the centre of global espionage with both the good guys (led by &apos;Spiderman 2&apos;s&apos; Alfred Molina) and the bad guys (led by Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist from &apos;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&apos;) in pursuit. Apparently, Nathan is the son of a top secret CIA undercover operative whose &apos;parents&apos; (Jason Isaacs and Maria Bello) are fellow CIA agents sent to protect him while his father is away. As with all chases, the aim is for something that Nathan has in his possession- some encrypted code with the names of dirty CIA agents. \n\nIt takes almost half an hour before the action kicks in, the introduction that sets up Nathan&apos;s adolescent issues and his secret high-school crush on Karen pure tedium that is definitely not director John Singleton&apos;s forte. Thankfully, the pace picks up considerably once Nathan is thrust into that implausible situation, with Singleton clearly at ease setting up the film&apos;s various action sequences. One of the first that sees Nathan&apos;s &apos;parents&apos; murdered is shot and edited for maximum thrills, and the climax set in a packed stadium with a live baseball match also packs suspense. \n\nTo Lautner&apos;s credit, the action also looks good because he performs most, if not all, of the stunts by himself- whether tackling a bigger- sized guy MMA-style or fleeing from the bad guys with parkour. Singleton doesn&apos;t go for the shaky-cam technique, allowing his audience to appreciate Lautner&apos;s physicality in its full glory. Even so, taking on the lead role requires Lautner to perform some serious acting in order for us to identify with his character&apos;s inner distress, but the square- jawed actor with his one-note performance fails to inspire any empathy. \n\nThe fault doesn&apos;t lie with Lautner entirely- to appeal to the teenage demographic which the producers are relying on to turn up for this movie, they have decided to amp up the obligatory romance between Nathan and Karen, even to the extent of letting the two teenage characters engage in some heavy making-out that stops just before it crosses the PG13 boundary. It is distracting and laughable, although the latter seems to be in line with most of the awful dialogue in the film. \n\nNot even veteran stars like Isaacs, Bello, Molina, Nyqvist and Sigourney Weaver (who plays Nathan&apos;s psychologist) can redeem this at-best made- for-TV thriller that tries to be the younger version of the Bourne series. So as much as Team Jacob may wish for Lautner to be their Matt Damon, or even Tom Cruise, it is clear from his debut headlining movie that once the &apos;Twilight&apos; phenomenon fades, the same can probably be said of Lautner&apos;s acting career as well. \n\n\n* www.moviexclusive.com\n"

      "reviewBody": "Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is a New York city cop who got off on a technicality following his execution of a supposed rapist/murder. Discharged from the force by his Captain (Jeffrey Wright), Taggart is viewed highly by Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe) for taking out the trash with a common thug. Seven years later, Hostetler, amidst a re- election battle against golden boy city councilman Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper), hires Taggart to find out who is sleeping with his gorgeous wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones). As Taggart follows, he uncovers a much larger conspiracy. \n\nIn his first solo outing, Allen Hughes (one half of the Hughes brothers that brought us &quot;The Book of Eli&quot;) now offers a stylish, dark vision of corruption in New York. The ladies are beautiful and all have something to hide, the men are violent and vicious and the story is ripped out of countless true-to-life headlines. &quot;Broken City&quot; lives up to its name and fires a slug packed with intrigue and intelligence. That doesn&apos;t necessarily translate to mean &quot;clever&quot;. \n\nThe story sold in the trailer is a bit misleading, but perhaps that&apos;s the point. Mayor Hostetler&apos;s hiring of the true-blue cop Taggart is only a minor segment of a much larger puzzle. It involves cops, businessmen, and politicians in bribery and exploitation with a prize that all but Billy seem to seek: power. Overall that is the film&apos;s theme and it more than adequately conveys it. If you understand that and aren&apos;t looking for much else, &quot;Broken City&quot; is your ticket. \n\nAs I was watching the film I kept thinking that there must have been some significant cutting and re-editing. Perhaps the original cut was too dry so they added in some scenes and cut some to make the film seem more edgy. But it doesn&apos;t seem as edgy as it could have been. A number of subplots (for instance Billy&apos;s actress girlfriend, or the undeveloped father-son relationship between two of the villains) go nowhere and remain unresolved when the screen goes black. I felt much the same way.\n\nMark Wahlberg does an excellent job playing Mark Wahlberg, a role he was born to play. Catherine Zeta-Jones is as beautiful and commanding as ever in a role that is too short for the movie. But it is Russell Crowe who devours his scenes with the political intensity I would suppose is necessary for any real Mayor of New York. Even as the script built around Billy lags, Crowe tears apart his role. He shows why he is truly one of the best actors in the business. \n\nThe supporting cast of this film are as much a draw as the leads. Jeffrey Wright, the usual supporting character with more power than he lets on, plays the secretive Police Commissioner. His character is introduced as a stock role but ends up being much more. Kyle Chandler has a small role that deserved to be expanded. Barry Pepper, who wasn&apos;t even featured in the trailer, is the only actor in the film with the same bravado as Crowe. His scenes, particularly one with Wright and Wahlberg, are indicative of why he should be the one on the poster, now buried in the bottom credits. \n\nOverall &quot;Broken City&quot; kept my attention but left me hungry for more. I suppose that is all you can ask for at the movies. I would take this ride again.",

      "reviewBody": "I am just going to assume you have seen the first Friday 13th movie. I mean if you haven&apos;t ... why would you watch the sequel! It clearly states so in the title, that this is not the first one. Which makes it even crazier that this rehashes the last minutes of the first film. While Cunningham didn&apos;t get how or why they would bring back Jason Vorhees (he was dead, wasn&apos;t he?), Steve Miner took over ... and quite the job he had to undertake. Make the same movie but a bit different.\n\nSo right from the start we get rid of what remained from the first movie (excluding Jason that is). And then we get more teenagers for him to be mad at. Why you ask? Does it really matter? Let&apos;s say because they can live a life he never could and he hates them for it. That should be good enough. We also get a final girl that is quite clever. Even if not as asexual as some might remember her. She&apos;s quite flirty isn&apos;t she? Rhetorical question that was.\n\nThis sequel does not just see a different Jason actor ... it sees many of them. Apparently a lot of crew members literally stepped into his shoes. Though Steve Dash is the one who seems to take most credit for it. Some may question that, with other stunt man trying to make their case, but it seems he did the heavy lifting (or glass related stunt breakthrough) ... no pun intended.\n\nSince the first Friday movie was so popular but also had many people who were shocked at the gore it had (again quite tame from todays standards), this had quite the issues. Especially because it tried to outdo the first one. So quite a few things landed on the cutting room floor. While this has more blood then, it seems to have less nudity. Though that does not matter that much I think - it&apos;s more about the killings isn&apos;t it? I think most would agree.\n\nWhile this also contains Jason as character and killer, sort of the first time, it is not the Jason most might know, especially thinking of the later movies here ...",

I thought the critics were exaggerating when they said how bad it was but they weren`t BATTLEFIELD EARTH is one of the worst films released by a major Hollywood studio. It`s badly directed , badly cast ( Barry Pepper as Jonnie makes for one of the least impressive screen hero`s ever seen . Maybe Travolta should have stuck to his guns and played Jonnie . He perhaps would have been slightly too old for the part but at least he does have some charisma unlike Pepper)  and has one of the worst scripts ever written. An alien race called Psychlos , sounds just like psychos , I bet they `re really evil and cruel . Oh they are evil and cruel just like psychos . Why do they think rats are the favourite food of humans when it`s the only thing they`ve seen humans eat ? And why do they think &quot; Rat brains &quot; is an insult to humans ? especially when they consider the &quot; man animals &quot; to be a primitive species . And am I alone in finding the term &quot; Man animals &quot; irritating ? Surely it should be &quot; Manimals &quot; ? A far sharper and clever expression . But sharp and clever is no way to describe this script . Cities stand almost intact after a thousand years since the collapse of human civilisation ! Not only that but so do large amounts of firearms , ammo and Harrier jump jets , and a flight simulator for the jump jets where the humans learn to fly within a week , and no doubt they`ll learn what petrol is and learn to put it in the jets in order to fly them . Does this sound very likely to you ? Let me put it this way: Go into a time machine and go back to the biblical times , capture a few dozen people , bring them back to the present and get them to become fighter pilots within the week. Do you think they`d be any good flying planes and shooting down enemy forces ? Me neither . Do you think they could overthrow a superior civilisation ? Me neither ? Do you think anyone involved with this film deserves to work again ? Me neither",

His girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) tells him that she&apos;s pregnant. She decides to raise the baby by herself rather than relying on him. His lawyer friend Brett (Chris Pratt) warns him against children. Then a lawyer from the sperm bank tells him that his donations spawned 533 children and many of them are suing to discover his identity. He is given the kids&apos; profiles and starts getting involved in their lives.\n\nThis has some limited laughs. To me, Vaughn is wearing out his welcome as a comedian. He is better off trying to transition away from his loudmouth brash character. This movie has more heart than laughs anyways. It works better as a light drama. He works quite well in that capacity. However I wish this has more substance. With so many kids, this feels a mile wide and an itch deep. There are apparently no other parents in any of these kids&apos; lives. Also I don&apos;t like the $100k debt story. That part takes the story to a different place which conflicts with the general tone of the movie.",

It presents a clear choice that we make everyday; live life to its fullest or use excuses to keep everyday the exact same until we die. I believe that there is no greater message worth spreading.\n\nAs I said, I have no intent on spoiling this movie whatsoever, but if you happen to run out of movie ideas, this is a solid choice even for family viewing, despite the 15 certificate.",

      "reviewBody": "A Ghost Story marks David Lowry&apos;s return to cinema since his 2013 indie hit &quot;Ain&apos;t Them Bodies Saints&quot;. Telling the story of a young couple (Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara) who buy a home and plan to start a life together in it until tragedy strikes. The Man suddenly dies and leaves the wife to fend for herself and build a life in the house by herself instead of with the man she loves. All while she is going through this in reality, the Man begins to haunt the home in a classical white sheet donning way. Throughout the years of being trapped to haunt this home, The Ghost also has to witness the love of his past life continue on without him and experience the moments of life without him. It is a beautiful and heart wrenching film that delves deeper into what grief does to not only a person but to a ghost.\n\nWhether you believe in an after life or not, A Ghost Story isn&apos;t worried about your beliefs. It plays out like a fantasy and that&apos;s how it stays which really bodes well for it. It never reaches beyond what is happening with the Man and the Woman and, of course, the House (which becomes a character in and of itself). David Lowry does a great job at setting up a &quot;what if&quot; scenario that all you can do is ask yourself, &quot;what would I do in this situation?&quot; The scariest part of that is there is literally nothing you can do. That rationalization is probably scarier than most horror films out today. \n\nThe film itself is a very digestible 90 minutes which is of a perfect length for this film because it doesn&apos;t go overboard and forget what it is. It&apos;s a horror film that is light on scares but heavy on thoughts and brains. There&apos;s no real scares. The big scare is putting yourself in the shoes of the ghost. What would you do if you had to witness your loved one go through grief and you couldn&apos;t do anything about it? You couldn&apos;t comfort them. You couldn&apos;t hold them. You could just watch. What if the person you loved moved on from you? What if they forget you? These questions are what made A Ghost Story scary for me. The level of helplessness that the film portrays is horrifying enough to remind audiences that death is still scary.\n\nOverall, the film is an experimental ghost story that shows Lowry in top form both as a writer and a director. The crass nature of reality is that death is lonely and he captures that perfectly. While many who take a look at the poster will certainly think that the film is just another horror movie trying to capitalize on some paranormal money, A Ghost Story is much more than that. It is beautiful to watch, heart wrenching to experience and an absolute delight cinematically.",

After a few chance encounters with the crown prince (who falls in love with her), Danielle finds herself on a collision course with her family who have royal designs of their own. Shot on location in France, the dialogue often veers very close to preachy, but knows when to cut the politics and return to the story. And a good story it is, well acted by Drew Barrymore as Danielle, and Angelica Huston as the wicked stepmother. This one is worth the rental.",

Movie per se is too good and I was moved by the very idea of the movie. As i am not checking the spoiler box, I must be brief......Though the movie is incomparable and nothing can be said without exposing the plot. Now I can easily say that Bollywood is showing some of its traits that can be compared to a Hollywood movie. The idea of the movie is among the best I have ever seen. This movie should go for Oscars not involving any kind of politics this time.\n\nLets see what can be said about the components of the movie, to start with we have 2 of the greatest Bollywood actor in the movie and chosen aptly for the roles. The four terrorists are chosen correctly for the role and also their getup is quite nice and appropriate. In the acting department only Deepal Shaw has shown some weakness, otherwise all the actors for big and small roles have shown their skills. Screenplay is good with too many story running simultaneously at the start of the movie. Cinematography is also fine with the scenes on the road, from the streets and all, also appreciable amount of money has been spent on it too. Background score is a bit too loud but some may find it appropriate but its not.....Editing is nice enough as the coherence is evident in the movie. Now what ..... the king of all ...... Mr Niraj, the director of the movie, he has done a great job by managing all the accoutrement on his back and using the right card at the right time.........This movie has an effect and is generally followed by a deep thinking........ &quot;When there&apos;s a match between India and Pakistan.....and when India loses ... ESPN &amp; STAR SPORTS are not blamed&quot; It simply says that stop blaming the accessory, take the responsibility of failure, then only you deserve the accolades.",

      "reviewBody": "Entourage isn&apos;t a very good movie. It&apos;s hard to even call it a movie because it&apos;s basically Entourage season 9 crammed into an hour and a half theatrical film. It picks up right where the show left off and continues with the same subtle banter humor and Ari Gold proving again why he&apos;s one of the best characters ever written. People who haven&apos;t seen the show will be confused, or at least bored, with the characters because they really have no development throughout this movie. There are simply too many characters to make a movie like this work. A mini-series? Absolutely. It would&apos;ve been great to flesh out some of these subplots with multiple episodes. But a feature film? It doesn&apos;t quite work.\n\nThe entourage are up to their usual shenanigans. Vince wants to direct a movie, Drama wants to get his acting break, Turtle wants to go out with Ronda Rousey, and E is having a baby with Sloan. Ari&apos;s storyline is by far the most engaging. Being a studio head now, everything is riding on Vince&apos;s movie to perform well in order to save Ari&apos;s (and Vince&apos;s) reputation, and in order to do that he needs to get funds from two financiers from Texas - a father-son duo played to perfection by Billy Bob Thornton and Haley Joel Osment respectively. Oddly enough, I found their scenes to be the most interesting of the movie. Larsen (Thornton) sends his son Travis (Osment) to Hollywood with Ari to see the movie early and to ensure it&apos;s worth putting up the extra funds, and Ari LOATHES it. Some of the funniest scenes come from the stress these guys put on Ari and there are a couple classic Ari outbursts. What Thornton and Osment really bring to the movie is a reality check. Larsen only cares about money - he never watches the movies, he&apos;s simply an investor, so naturally he and Ari clash when it comes to defending Vince&apos;s artistic freedom. It was these moments where Entourage felt more like a movie. There was tension, conflict, and although the Texans are written as the villains, their motives are actually grounded and understandable, especially for a movie as extravagant and gratuitous as this.\n\nTo get the most out of Entourage, it must be seen directly after the show. It feels like the show never skipped a step. The writing is on point, the characters are the ones you know and love from before, and it has even more celebrity cameos (probably the most in any movie ever). I&apos;d love to see an Entourage mini-series if they decide to continue this, but I was perfectly satisfied with this movie granting some closure to the group. There&apos;s even a priceless shot of the entourage walking down the red carpet with The Who&apos;s &quot;Eminence Front&quot; playing in the background. It&apos;s perfect.\n\nIf you&apos;ve never seen the show and are expecting a standard raunch comedy, then Entourage might fall flat. However, if you want to make the most out of it, watch the show (it&apos;s totally worth it) and then the movie, and it will make the experience better by a tenfold. It&apos;s an hour and a half of the gang up to their usual antics, and it&apos;s a boatload of fun.",

Stunning art direction, lively pacing and an absorbing narrative all make up for a few key performances which seem too modern, and minor instances where the editing isn&apos;t as sharp as one might hope. The maid&apos;s many entrances and exits are repetitive, but Scarlett Johansson proves to be an intuitive actress who excels in a role with very little dialogue. Quite good overall, and with a finale that smartly leaves the breathless viewer wondering...asking...wanting more. *** from ****",

If one views it as a &quot;Kill Bill&quot; kind of silliness that looks at the Mexican/Us border, then one may enjoy it. \n\nThe movie is not self-indulgent, rather it takes common stereotypes and puts them into funny situations. It has dark humor at times and makes no apologies for making fun of everything. It takes on many issues in a light-hearted way, but for some reason, it is not listed as a comedy. It, however, is a comedy. \n\nThe hero is a clever native American which is it&apos;s twist. The movie&apos;s plot is not predictable and it is filled with guns and shoot ups. It is a modern comedy that pokes fun at US politics and all its insincerity.\n\nWatch it. Do not take it seriously as an action flick and allow it to be the comedy that it is."

      "reviewBody": "A very tense and taught thriller that puts you along side Dwight as events unfold. I am so accustomed to the actions of characters in your typical Hollywood revenge thrillers that in my mind I was intensely screaming at Dwight&apos;s actions when IT, hit the fan. Then the realization came, this is not a film where the lead character becomes a fuel raged unstoppable hero suddenly becoming an expert on how to kill. \n\nThe quietness is very intense in this film and you focus everything on the characters. That is how good the directing and the script are, the film is not afraid of the silence. You become aware of how fast your heart is beating in the silence. The directing by Jeremy Saulnier was handled expertly and was feast for the eyes. Beautiful cinematography and his utilization of natural lighting made it easy to get lost in the film. There are scenes that will make you squirm and there are humorous tension releasing moments, that is how tight the script is you are relived that you have those moments. Everyone in this cast is on point, I did not feel one off key from any of actors. The gamut of emotions that run through Dwight&apos;s ( Macon Blair) eyes alone is worth the price of admission. There are some great actor finds and also some actor re-found here. Eve Plum as an unredeemable character in the film. Yes, that Eve Plum. Applauds to the whole cast. The score from the Blair Bros is haunting and never over powers a scene. It might sound like I am gushing over this film, but if you can talk and think about a film long after the lights come up then gush I must. \n\nIf you find this film near you, do yourself a favor and see it and be kind to your friends and bring them along. You are guaranteed a long conversation over drinks afterward. This is not your typical revenge film, yes it bleeds, but it also bleeds emotions.",

People need to learn that. This movie is absolutely incredible, the story is amazing, and it made me cry at least five times. Overall I recommend the movie, and I recommend you not believe everything you see online.

I liked the movie but throughout the first half, you get the feeling that there is something big coming up and you just can&apos;t wait till it does. The ending was quite satisfactory considering what happens.\n\nThe actors were all well chosen for the roles they portray. The bad guys led by the evil Capricorn fulfill their role as a motley crew. There is a hidden humor amongst them which does not bore. The CGI animations were very well done especially the magical creatures and alike.\n\nOverall, I would say that if you like Stardust, you will enjoy this one. Although, Stardust is still better in my opinion.\n\nI give it 6 only because the first half drags on a bit long and takes sometime to move onto the real story.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not going to put any spoilers in this review, but this is certainly a movie with some great twists and turns. I haven&apos;t been this excited about an upcoming release since The Sixth Sense or Memento. Hard to believe this is the director&apos;s first feature (although it&apos;s possible he cut his teeth in the commercial or music video world... I&apos;m not sure) I mean, certainly the film has a few problems, some of the moments didn&apos;t ring exactly true to me and the music was a touch maudlin at times. But when this film gets it right, it gets it really right. I was on the edge of my seat from the second act on. It&apos;s the first film I&apos;ve seen in awhile that manages to balance a genuine emotionality with a strong thriller aspect. Even Hayden Christensen, who I think we all had our doubts about after Episodes I-III, puts in a memorable and affecting performance. Definitely a film to see and a director I&apos;ll be keeping my eye on."

(well actually, &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; wasn&apos;t all that bad, i just couldn&apos;t think of another bad movie that we are being forced to see a sequel to... hahaha) the point is: I WANT ANOTHER SNAKE PLISSKEN MOVIE!!!!!"

      "reviewBody": "Time travel, eh? What a tricky old subject it is. Never seem to get it quite right, do they, these filmmakers? They always seem to drop a clanger that&apos;s caught not only by those film geeks who can spot obscure meaningless anachronisms that nobody else cares about, but even those who are paying only passing attention (eg. the older daughter doesn&apos;t have scars when she should). On top of this, the character caught up in this time-hopping conundrum resolutely fails to do the one thing every ordinary person would do in the same situation: try to break the chain of events. If the reasoning of this film is to be followed the outcome would be the same, but at least there would be a little logic involved.\n\nSandra Bullock plays the depressed housewife who, for no apparent reason, finds herself batted back and forth in time like a ball of wool between a kitten&apos;s paws. Every time she wakes up she finds herself one side or the other of her husband&apos;s death and very slowly pieces together the pieces of the puzzle. For the most part her predicament is surprisingly uninvolving, possibly because the writers neglected to give her any sort of character whatsoever, just a set of predictable responses to fantastic situations. Only at one brief moment, when Bullock asks her screen mother, &apos;If I let Jim die, is that the same thing as killing him?&apos; does the film even remotely look as if it is going to go off in some interesting direction. Unfortunately, that idea is dropped as quickly as it is suggested, and the film lumbers toward one of those predictable conclusions that used to be a twist when Rod Serling wrote it in the 50s.\n\nThe film isn&apos;t boring, but it isn&apos;t particularly interesting either. Bullock does what she&apos;s paid to do, but she&apos;s a lightweight actress at the best of times so, really, you should know what to expect when you see that she&apos;s appearing in this type of film.",

Great set-up for a story that takes a slow spiral downward once the couple returns home (to a rather lovely cottage in Southern California). Some sparks from principals Robert Redford and Demi Moore, but Woody Harrelson is out of his league and Adrian Lyne&apos;s direction is all visual and nothing much upstairs (and I could&apos;ve done without the horse-racing video suddenly morphing into a shot of Demi in &quot;the act&quot;). The film is shamefully enjoyable, and capped with teen-romance fever, but aren&apos;t these characters a little old for moony-eyed puppy love? ** from ****",

I thought the casting was great, the children who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the guy who played Amir as an adult was great! The scenes between him and Baba were especially touching. I thought the locations they used were interesting... scenes set in Afghanistan were shot in China, and one scene that took place in Fremont, CA (the graduation scene) was actually shot on Treasure Island in San Francisco. I worked one day as an extra on &quot;Kite Runner&quot; and it was that day, the day they shot the graduation scene. We reported to Treasure Island in the morning, they checked everyone&apos;s wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late 80s, an then we took our places in the audience. They shot the scene over and over again until they were happy with it. It was cool to see the actors up close and also to see the book&apos;s author, who was on hand as a story consultant. I thought this book was excellent and I recommend both the book and the movie to anyone. This is a moving story about friendship, love, guilt and eventual redemption. &quot;There is a way to be good again.&quot;",

Freddy is a killer in his own right, having his vengeance on the Elm Street parents who burnt him alive, so what does he have to gain by using a teenager&apos;s body?\n\nThe teenager in question is the nerdy, insecure Jesse (Mark Patton). This is probably why Freddy chose him as his vessel, because he is vulnerable and susceptible. Jesse also lives in the house on Elm Street Nancy used to live in. Freddy says he needs Jesse because Jesse has the body, and he - Freddy - has the brains. Jesse never kills anyone, though; it is always doing Freddy doing the killings, so I guess he uses Jesse to lure his victims. It still didn&apos;t entirely make sense why he needed a host, but it does allow for some excellent scenes in the form of make-up and prosthetics.\n\nJesse is seeing Lisa (Kim Myers - who, by the way, looks so much like Meryl Streep in this movie!). I found her a really nice character, who was caring and considerate. She is also a very strong character, who stands by Jesse.\n\nThis sequel might not be as good as the original, but it is a worthy entry in the series with some great kill scenes, a constant creepy atmosphere, excellent makeup, an awesome party scene, and a great performance once again from Robert England as Freddy. I also thought Mark Patton was really good portraying the troubled and confused Jesse. In general, this is a highly entertaining supernatural horror slasher.",

      "name": "Oddly mainstream for a blaxploitation flick, but Jackson is great and the total is fun and solid",
      "reviewBody": "Shaft (2000)\n\nThis comes so far after the original &quot;Shaft&quot; in 1971 you might hesitate to call it a sequel. It&apos;s more like a revival, or a nostalgic time trip. Except that it&apos;s all been updated nicely, with a feeling of the original sassiness intact. And the Isaac Hayes music is central, and terrific, making this a legit Shaft movie. \n\nSamuel Jackson plays the role perfectly, not pulling back and not overdoing it. The idea of a black cop in a city that still has racial biases, in this case emphasizing the rise of Latino drug lords as part of the fracturing, is mainstreamed here. It&apos;s not as daring or shocking to see this pushed forward, but it&apos;s still effective. Shaft, the main character (who never seems to have a first name), is powerful, smart, and unwilling to be pushed around by authority. Even if it means losing his job (or quitting--Shaft is always the one making his own choices). \n\nThe director, John Singleton, is not especially well positioned for a mainstream sequel with high production values (his one famous effort to date is &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;), but he pulls it off. This is a snappy, smart, well made movie. It&apos;s oddly mainstream, playing with clichés too easily, working with bad guy good guy tenets adding only the minor twist of racial or ethnic alliances, though even these we&apos;ve seen before. You can&apos;t help but see &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; from three years earlier as a far more interesting, well made, and timely movie. That one was by Quentin Tarantino, which changes the score a bit, but it starred Jackson, again, and makes the most of him.\n\nYou might say Singleton makes the most of Jackson here, too, but a better way to look at it is that Jackson makes the most of Singleton. He takes over the movie, and it&apos;s a good thing. He has talent and presence in a classic Hollywood acting way. The cast around him is really strong, which is nice. (There is a cameo by the original director of the 1971 &quot;Shaft,&quot; Gordon Parks, in a bar scene, if you are lucky--a white haired older black man at the table.)\n\nThe other terrific actor is Jeffrey Wright, playing a drug king with enough realism and panache to make it real and glitzy both. The third main character is the future Batman, Christian Bale, who is a great bad guy and who you actually miss in the last parts of the movie.\n\nWhat really brings this down to earth, and too much so, is the story, which is boilerplate stuff. There is machismo, and guns, and a play of one bad guy against another, and one cop against another. You might say, hey, isn&apos;t there room for more cop and crime movies that work in familiar circles? Yes. But I again refer to &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; as a way to see out of this box. \n\nThis new &quot;Shaft&quot; is good stuff--it&apos;s well acted, tightly edited, directed with professional canny (noticeable in lots of different ways), and brings up racial clichés in a fun and even important way. It descends by the last third into overused chase and shoot scenes between cops and robbers. But...it&apos;s better than its reputation, for sure. I say see it. Enjoy the attitudes. The acting. And the homage to the original.",

At magic hour, a bad guy on a motorcycle is intercut with ludicrous but gorgeous images of other bad guys (in suits, no less) ritualistically banging axe handles together in some underground warehouse in Los Angeles in time with a dark, brooding synth score \n\nThe sequence that follows, a madman&apos;s bullet-ridden assault on a supermarket, is again stunningly shot and staged and a triumph of style over anything you want to name.\n\nOnce these bravura sequences have passed, mediocrity and Hollywood Plotting 101 cuts in and we&apos;re pulled back into a dull reality.\n\nBut don&apos;t fret. Sit tight for long enough and you get an enthusiastically staged car chase with ducks, machine guns, classic cars bursting from buildings, a Santa who comes close to being roadkill and badly uttered Stallone lines.\n\nFast forward then to the film&apos;s climactic shootout on motorcycles and you&apos;re left with an action film that spends forty minutes doing everything right.\n\nStallone emotes with cruise control and his wife-at-the-time Brigitte Nielson just wears the clothes and moves from first position to second.",

I think it&apos;s the odd one out, but certainly not the worst.  It&apos;s the only one of the three that regularly stretches credibility (the plot twists are really wild), and the only one with a male protagonist, but it&apos;s also the most exciting of the films and, ultimately, the most disturbing. The ending in particular is a killer.\n\n&quot;Red&quot; tinkers a bit with &quot;White&quot;; in fact, if I&apos;m not mistaken, it entirely changes the resolution of this film for the worse.  That&apos;s too bad.  &quot;White&quot; works best on its own, as a pessimistic movie, without the more optimistic outlook of &quot;Red&quot; grafted on in retrospect.

      "name": "A Frank Review",
      "reviewBody": "I happened to see the trailer for a movie I had never heard of, called Frank, at 8:45AM this Saturday morning. Within five minutes of seeing the preview, I found that the Angelika Theater at Mockingbird Station was the only place in Dallas showing this wonderfully bizarre looking movie, and by 10:20AM, I was sitting in a dark room with about twelve other people, waiting to see just what this giant paper-mache head had in store for us.\n\nMaybe I should step back to explain that last part. Frank revolves around an avant-garde musician names Frank, who is never seen without an oversized paper-mache mask on. The trailer promised quirky indie escapism, possibly some decent music, and some references to SXSW – ahhh, there is such beauty in under-promising and over-delivering.\n\nFor a brief moment, it feels like Frank will be little more than a stylized fictional Behind The Music type of movie because the central narrative is observed and reported from the viewpoint of an involved outsider, the new guy in the band. The outsider point of view is a perfect choice, however, because the audience then has the same questions as the narrator so we&apos;re all in it together. Is the end product of music/art as important as the process of creating it or who you create it with? Frank captures the ambition and compulsion of creating art and very harshly slaps away any generalizations of how or why an artist is the way he is. The paper- mache head isn&apos;t a gimmick for the movie or the music.\n\nOn the topic of music, Frank and his band The Soronprfbs, are easily ranked in the top five fictional bands – The Wonders(That Thing You Do), Stillwater(Almost Famous), Eddie &amp; The Cruisers(Eddie &amp; The Crusiers), Wylde Ratttz(Velvet Goldmine), and The Soronprfbs(Frank). The music falls somewhere between The Flaming Lips, Jim Morrison, and an extremely catchy coffee shop rambler.\n\nThe band is absolutely mesmerizing every single second they are on the screen and much of that credit has to go to Michael Fassbender. Because we can&apos;t see his face, every bit of emotion must be poured out elsewhere. Fassbender delivers an extremely physical performance. From the combination of his hands and voice, to the way he shuffles when uncomfortable, to the way he loses control when he sings, the small crowd that happens to see Frank this year will be seeing one of the best performances of 2014.\n\nIt has been almost two days since I saw Frank and I still can&apos;t get it out of my mind. Maybe it&apos;s the music or maybe it&apos;s the acting but I think the bigger reason is that it asks the questions I thought only I had. How does someone create something both abstract and powerful? What part of my brain should I be tapping into? Why can&apos;t I? Frank is a photograph of the special brand of artistic jealousy that wants to be or at least be part of something bigger and better than ourselves, all while realizing the privilege of simply getting to be witness to that greatness."

      "reviewBody": "Having just reviewed the first three movies that was co-written by Harold Ramis, not to mention the first three of his that also starred at least one SNL cast member-former or present at the time-we&apos;re now at his fourth of both categories and also his first in which he also appears. As with the previous two-Meatballs and Caddyshack-Stripes also stars Bill Murray. Also, as with Meatballs, Ramis&apos; co-writers here are Len Blum and Dan Goldberg with Ivan Reitman once again directing. They make a good team here, Murray and Ramis, as they end up joining the Army mainly because of the former&apos;s bad luck in his last two hours as a civilian. Among the people they encounter in basic training: Judge Reinhold and John Candy who was familiar with both Bill and Harold since they all worked for Second City during the &apos;70s while Candy and Ramis were on SCTV together as well. Anyway, they have a tough sergeant in Warren Oates who provides at least one serious scene with Murray when he tells him what he really thinks of him. But there&apos;s also John Larroquette as a bumbling captain who&apos;s threatened with Artic duty if he doesn&apos;t shape up. Oh, and besides Ramis and Candy, other Second City/SCTV members in this movie include Dave Thomas as a mud wrestling host and Joe Flaherty as a Russian guard. And finally, Ramis and Murray fall for a couple of female MP&apos;s played by Sean Young and P. J. Soles, respectively. Okay, with all that out of the way, I&apos;ll just say that I found Stripes hilarious up to the graduation and not as much after that but still pretty entertaining. Now, despite that earlier confrontation scene between Murray and Oates, one doesn&apos;t really expect too much learning about Army life on the former&apos;s part but part of me did feel he genuinely respected the sergeant and vice versa at the end. One more thing, while you can no longer be asked if you&apos;re a homosexual when applying for the military because of &quot;Don&apos;t Ask, Don&apos;t Tell&quot;, I still found it hilarious hearing Bill and Harold&apos;s replies. Okay, so on that note, I definitely recommend Stripes. And, remember, &quot;There she was just a-walkin&apos; down the street singing &quot;Doo Wah Diddy Diddy Dumb Diddy Doo...&quot; P.S. Larroquette is a native of New Orleans which is a two-hour drive from my current hometown of Baton Rouge, La. And his assistant is played by John Volstad who is best known as one of the Darryls on &quot;Newhart&quot; and unlike there, he has lines here which was interesting to hear. Update 7/2/10: I&apos;ve just seen the extended version with 18 minutes of cut footage. There&apos;s a funny scene of Bill and Harold ending up in another country when they go AWOL. There&apos;s also a sexily funny one of them with P.J. and Sean in Germany. Those I wished had stayed. The others I&apos;m glad they cut.",

The comedy in this film is just as good as the original though, there are so many scenes that get me laughing just thinking about them.\n\nThe story in this film is even more bizarre than the original, but that&apos;s what makes it so great.  Peter Hewitt does a great job directing this film with a great cast.  The core cast from the original film returns to their characters in this film and all do a fantastic job with their roles.  I don&apos;t care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor!  I really enjoyed his portrayal of Ted in both of these films as I did Alex Winter&apos;s Bill.  I was very happy to see George Carlin returning to the role of Rufus, very cool!  Hal London Jr, who plays the part of Ted Logan&apos;s father does a really good job.  The scene where Ted possesses his fathers body and Hal London Jr begins acting like Ted is a great scene, and he pulls it off impressively well.  I can&apos;t forget to mention William Sadler as Death, he completely made the movie for me.  The rest of the cast is quite good as well.\n\nIf you liked the first installment of the Bill and Ted series, then I would hope you would like this film as well.  But, don&apos;t expect it to be as good as the original.  I really hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,\n\n-Chris",

      "reviewBody": "The journey that began on the small screen in 1967 comes to its end on the big screen in 1991, after three TV seasons, six films, and the creation of a cultural phenomenon unrivaled in the history of television. The crew of the original series had met with mixed results on the big screen, producing the excellent The Wrath of Khan, but also the inexcusably bad The Final Frontier; the other four ranged from passable to good. After the financial failure of Star Trek V, Paramount brought back Star Trek II director Nicholas Meyer, and commissioned from him the final voyage of the original cast. As Star Trek so often does, the events depicted mirror the glasnost of the late 1980s, as the collapse of the Soviet Union eased global tensions and heralded the beginning of a new era. In the Trek universe, the possibility of rapproachment between the Federation and the Klingon Empire raises the hackles of hardliners on both sides, and Kirk and co. must prevent the weak peace from being destroyed. The original cast is in fine form, all of them giving their all to make the (potentially) final appearances of their characters memorable. Despite William Shatner&apos;s reputation as a ham actor, he delivers a great performance here; his final log entry is one of Trek&apos;s finest moments. As the villain of the piece, we get General Chang (Christopher Plummer), a Klingon out to insure &quot;no peace in our time&quot;. Plummer is superb, chewing scenery and spewing Shakespeare with a wonderfully loathsome presence. I would rank Chang below Khan and the Borg Queen, but far above all the other Trek villains. There are some tacky anachronisms typical of Meyer&apos;s style, and the usual amount of discontinuities and canon issues; but that&apos;s inevitable, and I can accept it if it leads to a good story. Trek VI is a good story. 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Yes, I was once a 9-year-old who would &apos;yee-haw&apos; in front of the TV every Friday night. But then I grew up and basically forgot about the Dukes of Hazzard. Years later, when I learned of the movie, I scoffed. I had zero expectations and no plans to see it. Then months later, I ran into it on HBO. \n\nThis movie is a blast. Anyone looking for a dusty museum exhibit to replay the original series for a new generation will be disappointed. But It&apos;s great fun for anyone willing to be in on the joke and go along for the ride.\n\nBoss Hogg isn&apos;t fat. Uncle Jesse smokes weed. Roscoe is less cartoon bumbling, more cartoon menacing. Daisy is blonde. The General&apos;s paint job needs... explaining. \n\nBut the movie retains everything that made the original series work: car chases, bar brawls, short-shorts and good-hearted outlaws looking out for the good folks of Hazzard County. The movie brings back all these crucial elements... and then takes them out and gets them drunk. Buckle up for safety!\n\nThe plot is an inch deep, but gets the job done. The humor is perfectly simple and perfectly funny. And, aside from Burt Reynolds, the cast aren&apos;t winning any Oscars (ever), but they can handle these characters just fine. \n\nLastly, I had no idea how much I missed the General Lee. I&apos;m not a car guy or an action-for-the-sake-of-action guy, but the car chases, crashes and jumps in this movie are incredible. Most modern action scenes are just noise and blur, but the driving-action scenes in this movie are extremely well-paced and well-executed. I could replay the car chase in Atlanta (with Bo in emotional crisis behind the wheel) a hundred times and never stop loving that scene.\n\nI was truly surprised how much I enjoyed this movie - both times (thanks, Netflix!), with about 10 years between viewings. The big screen version of The Dukes of Hazzard actually works, and no one was more surprised than me.\n\nNow how do you think them boys are going to top this one?",

Now, coming back to the movie, &quot;Dunki&quot; is a decent entertainer with a great first half and a weak second half. The screenplay is engaging until the first half; after that, it falters. This is the only weakest point of &quot;Dunki.&quot; The music is outstanding and fits perfectly into the scenes. The dialogues are well-written. SRK, Taapsee, and others have done a tremendous job. Overall, it&apos;s a great entertainer for the festive season. It might not be Raju Hirani&apos;s best, but you have to remember it&apos;s still better than others&apos; best work .",

      "reviewBody": "Remakes are generally a bad idea. The percentage of remakes that are equal to or better than the original is probably less than 1%. However, English-language remakes of foreign films (or vice-versa I suppose) are a slightly different story. The percentage is still low, but maybe not quite as low. Anyway, all of this is to say that while I was skeptical of an Oldboy remake, I was not 100% against it. The benefit that a remake of a foreign film has over a regular remake is that you are pretty much forced to make things different, at least a little, simply by virtue of different tastes and filmmaking styles between cultures. That&apos;s a good thing, in theory, because all of the good remakes I can think of changed things from the original. The cookie cutter shot-for-shot remakes are the worst. Oldboy (2013) is, unfortunately, not a good remake.\n\nIn some ways the movie smartly avoids trying to copy some things from the original that would not fit with an American version. There&apos;s no hypnosis, no guy cutting his own tongue off, and no octopus scene. It&apos;s when the movie tries to copy its Korean roots that it fails most. I&apos;m speaking particularly of the comedy and action portions, which feature Josh Brolin trying to mimic Choi Min-sik with embarrassing results. Obviously the biggest problem is that the twist that the first movie relied so heavily on is going to be spoiled for a large portion of the audience that will even want to see this one. Worse, this remake seems to telegraph the twist in ways the original didn&apos;t. I watched the movie with friends who hadn&apos;t seen the original and they all figured out the twist and none were particularly shocked by it. Finally, it ends with the type of bizarre &quot;happy&quot; ending that plays to the worst stereotypes of Hollywood filmmaking.\n\nJosh Brolin was probably a weak choice to play the lead. He&apos;s not awful but just very unimpressive. Sharlto Copley, however, is terrible. Absolutely horrid. Yoo Ji-Tae was so good in the original film. He gave a sympathetic performance that actually made you feel for his character, even when you&apos;re being repulsed by his actions. In contrast, Copley is a completely unsympathetic foppish cartoon villain. To make matters worse, Samuel L. Jackson also appears in the movie in a villainous role and, of course, his huge personality makes Copley appear all the more underwhelming. The only real bright spot in the cast is Elizabeth Olsen, who continues to impress and is definitely headed for bigger things than this. Spike Lee&apos;s direction is workmanlike and uninspired. The less said about it the better. Yes it&apos;s a poor remake but, more importantly, it&apos;s a poor film altogether.",

If you have never seen The Ring, do yourself a favor and see Ringu first. It really shows how the Japanese can make good horror. The story is based on a novel written by Koji Suzuki entitled &quot;Ringu&quot;. If you get the chance, you can pick this up over at Amazon, it&apos;s a very good read and shows you how the story was meant to be told. The Japanese film was a better adaptation of the movie.

I liked the casting and the storyline. The actors did a good job, esp. the young college student male lead. This is a story that could have actually happened, imo. The music was a big part of the movie, too. Good soundtrack that, while I was aware of it, it did not take away from the scenes but built up my anxiety! It was like another character. Definitely worth seeing for all the right reasons. Very entertaining and kept my attention throughout. All this without &quot;blood &amp; guts&quot; galore - made me think of the old Alfred Hitchcock-type thrillers that depended more on the viewer&apos;s anticipation and imagination. Lastly, I thought I had the plot figured out, but I was surprised at how wrong I was. Smiled on my way out of the theater.",

      "reviewBody": "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo is far from an original or subtle comedy, but I don&apos;t think that is what the director had in mind when doing this movie. All in all it is quite a good movie, even though it is a real no-brainer.\n\nDeuce Bigalow used to work as a tank cleaner in SeaWorld, but got fired because he was cleaning the tanks in the nude in front of a lot of people. Since than he cleans domestic fish tanks for a living. This job brings him into contact with Antoine Laconte, who works as a male escort and owns a gigantic apartment, filled with all kinds of precious items. One of these is a tank full of very expensive fish.\n\nWhen one of the fish gets sick Deuce is asked to help and, since Antoine is going to Europe for 3 weeks, he has to check in on the apartment daily to look at the fish. But instead of checking in on Antoine&apos;s home, Deuce takes the opportunity to move into the flat. He accidentally sets fire to the toaster and breaks the fish tank. Knowing that Antoine will kill him for that when he sees it, Deuce has to make sure everything is exactly the way it was. But that will cost a lot of money... which he doesn&apos;t have. To raise enough money in that short period of time he decides to start working as a low-budget male gigolo.\n\nAs you can expect in this kind of movie, he doesn&apos;t meet any normal women who want to make use of his services. It is a real freak show, filled with a 500 pound woman, a woman who&apos;s about 8 feet tall... The movie is full of this kind of predictable facts, but when you are prepared for it, it really doesn&apos;t bother. Don&apos;t expect to see a highly sofisticated movie, but it isn&apos;t as bad as you might expect. One of the scenes that I really liked were the parodies on other movies like The Matrix.\n\nI would recommend this movie to everybody who doesn&apos;t mind laughing about older and predictable jokes. It&apos;s an excellent movie when you came home from a hard day at work, when you are tired and looking for a good laugh without having to think too much. I reward it with a 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s a lot to love and enjoy about Rock of Ages. Like most musicals, it has a great buzz and electric feel to it. You can&apos;t help but finish this film with a big smile on your face and its a very feel good comfort experience.\n\nThe production value was also great, from the sets to the costumes, everything felt realistic and just looked cool.\n\nThen there&apos;s the key part of any musical, the songs. You can&apos;t fault the selection, there were numerous classics which just kept on coming. Maybe a little too much.\n\nI couldn&apos;t help but feel like there were just too many songs. There wasn&apos;t any time to take a breather and the story wasn&apos;t allowed to develop outside of the music. As a result I couldn&apos;t find myself connecting to any of the characters and I feel like there was a lot of missed opportunity to develop the plot and characters because of the amount of songs.\n\nThis wasn&apos;t the only problem with the plot... it was all over place. Was this film about Sherry, Drew, Stacee Jaxx, Patricia, Lonnie and Dennis? Who knows. There was too much sharing of the spotlight, and the constant changing of perspectives and protagonists started to give me whiplash. I think things would have benefitted from having a more obvious and clear protagonist to root for and follow, which would have given the film more drive and direction.\n\nI also had mixed feeling about the characters. What Russell Brand was doing with his sporadic Brummie accent I&apos;ll never know. He&apos;s never been a great actor, and the accent just made everything so much worse. The two &quot;main&quot; characters of Sherrie and Drew were also pretty bland and I wasn&apos;t that fussed about them. Tom Cruise on the other hand, what a surprise. Easily the best thing about this film. He threw himself into this role and it massively paid off. It&apos;s worth watching for him alone.\n\nFinally, as much as I liked the selection of songs, the singing wasn&apos;t always on point and was quite obviously auto tuned to a heavy extent for some of them. I think musical films need to start finding a better balance between casting big names to get bums on seats, but also casting actors who can sing.\n\nRock of Ages is definitely fun, and any musical lover will find lots to enjoy here. I did however find it to be quite messy and overcrowded with one dimensional characters and too many songs. Lots of fun, but not a great film.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. The war on drugs has become a bit of a punchline in the real world, but has proved to be fertile ground for filmmaking: Sicario (2015), American Hustle (2013), Traffic (2000). Additionally, the popular Netflix show &quot;Narcos&quot; takes on the same Medellin drug cartel as this latest from director Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer, 2011). The movie is based on the true events of Robert Mazur&apos;s book &quot;The Infiltrator: My Secret Life Inside the Dirty Banks Behind Pablo Escobar&apos;s Medellin Cartel&quot; (a title that&apos;s very descriptive, if a bit long).\n\nBryan Cranston continues his impressive Hollywood run this time as Robert Mazur, the man who goes undercover to expose the money-laundering system of the cartel. His flamboyant alter-ego is known as Bob Musella, a character that allows Mazur (and Cranston) to show a side not typically seen. His antics get him inside Columbian Drug Lord Escobar&apos;s organization in the mid-1980&apos;s.\n\nWhen Mazur realizes the traditional method of chasing the drugs isn&apos;t working, he decides the age-old idiom &quot;follow the money&quot; might be a better approach. This takes him inside the world of international money laundering, and he learns that banks and governments are quite dependent on this huge business of drug money movement.\n\nThere are specific groups of people here: the government agencies, the small task force, the corrupt (and appreciative) bankers, the various levels within the cartel, and even Mazur&apos;s family  all these forces intertwine to make life difficult for Mazur and his team, and provide a glimpse into the complexities of undercover work.\n\nIn addition to stellar work from Cranston, the cast is terrific. John Leguizamo plays Mazur&apos;s motivated partner Abreu; Diane Kruger plays his undercover fiancé; Juliet Aubrey is Mazur&apos;s real life wife who doesn&apos;t much appreciate his declining the early retirement offer; Olympia Dukakis provides a dash of comedy relief as Mazur&apos;s Aunt; Yul Vasquez is the creepy money manager for Escobar; Benjamin Bratt plays Roberto, Escobar&apos;s right-hand man and the key to Mazur&apos;s case; and Elena Anaya (The Skin I Live In, 2011) is Roberto&apos;s wife. Also present are Amy Ryan, Jason Isaacs and the always great Michael Pare.\n\nThere are a couple of standout scenes – one involving chicken and voodoo, and another with a briefcase mishap, but my favorite is the Happy Anniversary cake scene in the restaurant where Mazur flashes his alter-ego Musella for his real wife to see  and she is understandably stunned.\n\nThe movie does a nice job of capturing the look and feel of the era (30 years ago), but it&apos;s somehow missing the elevated suspense it portends to drag us and the characters through. Some elements seemed impossible to believe – why would Mazur risk his family&apos;s safety? The timeline was a bit muddled. We aren&apos;t sure how much time has passed, but there certainly don&apos;t seem to be enough interactions before Roberto is telling Mazur he is &quot;like family&quot;. It plays a bit like those romance movies where the two leads are head over heels in love after a conversation or two. An element is missing and it affects the level of tension throughout the film. And that&apos;s something even a Leonard Cohen song (&quot;Everybody Knows&quot;) can&apos;t fix.",

It gives me hope, along with a select other few, that cinematic story telling has not simply been reduced to the next ex-cia to shoot up the town, or romantic comedy with the same stale happily ever after ending.\n\nIt is real, and comes with the all of the uncertainty and heartbreak of life.",

      "reviewBody": "As bad as Inspector Gadget and The Last Airbender are, they look like masterpieces compared to Dragonball Evolution. The TV series was very, very good, the movie was half-baked and bland. The only good thing was James Marsters, while he mayn&apos;t look exactly like Piccolo he at least tries to capture the essence of the character. Just a shame he isn&apos;t in enough of the movie to elevate it even more.\n\nWhy do I say that Dragonball Evolution is a contender for the worst live-action film for an animated TV series? The scenery and costumes are nice to look at, but the cinematography does nothing for me, the editing is shoddy and the lighting is dull. The special effects don&apos;t impress either, they do distract rather than enhance and it doesn&apos;t help that some of them are half-baked.\n\nThe film is also too rushed, and in all honesty I was left bored by the end, nothing really interesting in my view happens. The story is juvenile and predictable, the dialogue is terrible either being cheesy or due to the delivery very rarely ringing true and the direction is bland. The acting is nothing to smile about, Goku and Yamuka especially are complete disasters and show a complete lack of acting ability. Not only that, the characters here are treated in the most banal way possible and are difficult to like as a result.\n\nOverall, a very poor movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "The summer of 2014 hasn&apos;t seen as many strong independent films like last year. However, in the final days of the summer movie season comes Michael Dowse&apos;s &quot;What If&quot;, a smart and charming romantic comedy. It&apos;s a well written film about Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) who becomes friends with Chantry (Zoe Kazan) who is with her long time boyfriend Ben (Rafe Spall). Wallace and Chantry develop feelings for each other and struggle with what to do. It sounds cheesy and boring, but don&apos;t miss this film. \n\nElan Mastai&apos;s script is sharp and never over extends it hand. It combines several kinds of humor, from slapstick to witty. Mastai&apos;s screenplay balances all these humors well while also getting to the heart of the situation. The film has depth and mature conversations about romance and what to do when stuck in a love triangle.\n\nThe film is also well cast. Radcliffe feels very natural in the role. It&apos;s nice to see him play an everyday man instead of some epic famous character. Radcliffe is good at both and this film proves it. He also has good chemistry with Kazan. Radcliffe and Kazan are balanced well with Adam Driver&apos;s Allan and Mackenzie Davis&apos; Nicole. Driver is hilarious and steals the scenes. All of them fit their parts very well and give the film its charm.\n\nThe story can be predictable and maybe a bit forced at times, but its heart warming and grows on you. It uses artistic and visual motifs well and feels well rounded and complete. The film also has a nice indie rock soundtrack that fits right in. &quot;What If&quot; seems like a nice blend between &quot; (500) Days of Summer&quot; and &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;. \n\nThe romantic comedy genre seems to be criticized a lot. There are plenty of junk films in it, but &quot;What If&quot; is a gem. It&apos;s well written and acted and is able to balance many kinds of humors to please many people. &quot;What If&quot; is a romantic comedy done right. It is a nice little treat at the end of a blockbuster filled summer.",

      "name": "&quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot; (2009) is a good movie for Cage to go crazy.",
      "reviewBody": "Nicolas Cage - an Oscar winning actor in Werner Herzog&apos;s movie &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot; which has nothing to do with Harvey Keitel&apos;s 1992 film, goes absolute crazy in some scenes, but not as furious as he can. These limitations can be for good, to keep movie&apos;s tone in check. And there are no reasons to break drama genre and go bizarre into even more comedic and crazier tone. Because comedy is a pretty usual thing in this flick. Cage&apos;s character Terence McDonagh is a drug addict, very reactionary, he is frightening at times, because of what he is capable of, but inside he is a good , selfish person, who just seeks a way out. He has this back problem, taking pills, which aren&apos;t helping, he basically takes his own medicine ,using cocaine mostly with his prostitute girlfriend Frankie (Eva Mendes). After a group homicide of several immigrants Detective McDonagh is assigned to investigate. This and his personal problems lead this character into an interesting ending. Watching the movie you can&apos;t dislike Terence, the direction is really effective to make us care about, at first look, a scum like McDonagh. The plot goes many unexpected ways. Thanks to screenwriter William M. Finkelstein, who definitely wrote an engaging script.\n\nAfter loosing the main witness for immigrant&apos;s case, McDonagh goes rogue, uniting with the drug-boss, to make some quick money in order to pay debts and save his girlfriend from what she got herself into. That lead to a group of absolutely unexpected events that are not to be estimated anyhow. Nic Cage&apos;s character is that chemical element, provoking those events as he becomes a completely different person throughout the film.\n\nThe humor in this film is one special part that I enjoyed the most. Not only McDonagh is a guy who threatens helpless old people, but does it with style, and with script&apos;s emotional help by making those old people not only victims but villains in that scene, which is it absolutely funny, because emotionally you expect and want McDonagh to do so. \n\nThere no much action in this film, at some point it becomes a little fantasy of a drug addict. Moments of him, seeing dancing sole and stuff like that makes this movie even more bizarre, but Herzog doesn&apos;t overuse scenes like that, so to make this movie a good combination of drama, comedy and addict&apos;s fantasy.",

I saw John Carpenter&apos;s &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot; when it first came out in 1976 and remember it as being one of Carpenter&apos;s best movies. Now we have another version with basically the same characters including the drunk, originally played by Dean Martin, who is tested by the struggle for survival and eventually passes with flying colors. When I first heard the Christmas music in the movie, it took me a moment to grasp the reason for the Dean Martin selection until I realized it was the producer&apos;s way of paying homage to the crooner&apos;s performance in &quot;Rio Bravo.&quot; This would be more entertaining for those who have not seen the originals. This remake follows the originals to the point of spoiling some of the surprises intended. I won&apos;t go into detail on this since it would then spoil the surprises for those who have not seen the originals.

      "name": "A glorious retelling of the J.M. Barrie tale",
      "reviewBody": "Tradition be damned! I HATED the Mary Martin, Sandy Duncan, Cathy Rigby productions of Peter Pan! There, I&apos;ve said it. I realize I&apos;m in the minority on this point, but I have NEVER been able to accept the idea of some actress dressing up in silly green tights, singing equally silly songs, while pretending to be a prepubescent boy pretending to fly on silly piano wires. I fully admit that it&apos;s a pet peeve of mine and not meant to denigrate those who have delighted in this tradition. As a long time lover of the J.M. Barrie stories and play, all I can say is that P.J. Hogan&apos;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot; is the Pan movie I have waited my entire life for. It is simply a glorious retelling of the J.M. Barrie tale. After Spielberg&apos;s dreadful 1991 abortion, &quot;Hook&quot; I was convinced that the story had been buried forever as far as big budget film-making was concerned. I thought all there would be was the 1953 Disney animated film, which unfortunately is more Disney than Barrie or worse, that I was condemned to a lifetime of endless reruns of Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard. Boy, was I wrong. Taking its visual cue from the wondrous illustrations of Maxfield Parrish, Edmund Dulac, N.C. Wyeth and Arthur Rackham, this new film recreates the storybook Never Land on a level that has never been achieved before, nor will ever be again.\n\nBut the film is not simply a special-effects fest a la &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The effects, dazzling as they are, are just the icing on the cake. Hogan understands it is the characters, and our need to care for them, that must carry the film. And this film has a wonderful cast. Jeremy Sumpter is a great Peter Pan. Gifted with a luminous smile and physicality, he captures all the radiant cockiness, the self-delighted impishness of undefeated, indefatigable youth. One almost feels sorry for Hook for having such an adversary. Rachel Hurd-Wood in a very impressive film debut does a marvelous job as Wendy, the young daughter of the Darlings now at the beginning of young womanhood. Hurd-Wood is both child and woman, and she and Sumpter have very warm and charming screen chemistry in their scenes together, capturing the potentially dangerous under-current of adolescent sensuality without ever hitting you over the head with it, or becoming too cloy. Olivia Williams as Mrs. Darling isn&apos;t given much to do, beyond being the mother everyone wishes they had, but she does that very well, and she serves the story beautifully. And she is absolutely gorgeous. In the double role of Mr. Darling/Captain Hook, Jason Isaacs finally comes into his own as the cinema&apos;s most perfidious villain since Basil Rathbone crossed swords with Errol Flynn. Isaacs is simply magnificent in a role he was born to play. With a sneer and a swash of his buckle he obliterates forever the image of Hook as a buffoon, the mere butt of Peter&apos;s jokes. This is a dangerous, deadly Hook, a figure of Satanic dignity, who one can believe might actually best Peter some dark, unlucky night. Lynn Redgrave plays the role of Aunt Millicent, a character created for the film and not in any of the Peter Pan literature. While the new part doesn&apos;t really add anything to the story, it doesn&apos;t really take anything away either. And Redgrave is always a joy to watch. Finally the performance of the great Richard Briers should be noted. As Smee he steals every scene he is in. It is a delightful comic turn. \n\nThe one performance I questioned was Ludivine Sagnier as Tinker Bell. While I loved the concept of Tink as a bitch-sprite, capable of murderous intent, I felt at times her performance was a little broad. This may have been the outgrowth of having to play a purely physical role without the benefit of any spoken lines. On the other hand I thought she was vastly superior to Julia Roberts who played the same role in &quot;Hook&quot;. Nor was she a Marilyn Monroe wannabe from Disney. Sagnier to her credit never plays the part for easy sentimentality. \n\nHogan and company have brought the Barrie work to the screen and have rightly restored to it a child&apos;s sense of awe and wonder, of both beauty and terror co-existing side by side and for this reason alone it is the definitive film version of Peter Pan",

De Bont is a terrific creator of suspense and camera setups. All his hard work as a cinematographer paid off in movies such as these. He really knows how to build up an atmosphere accompanied by subtle visual effects and sound design. The way that big house groans and &apos;breathes&apos; just makes my heart beat faster. Equally great is Jerry Goldsmith&apos;s score. In some scenes when combined with the atmospheric sound effects it made my neckhair stand up. I was genuinely terrified. A special mention must go to the art direction and set decoration. The house has such wonderful and at the same time disturbing architecture, the thought of having to spend a night there gives me the chills. About the acting, I thought it was nothing special. The Haunting is a solely audiovisual experience, where acting is only of secondary importance. In short, I enjoyed this movie and didn&apos;t think the ending was bad.  I see about 200-300 movies each year, and I see a lot of bad ones, but this is not one of them. Go see it and decide for yourself."

He reconnects with a former classmate Hae-mi (Jeon Jong-seo) whose affections later turn to the very rich Ben (Steven Yuen). Ben&apos;s unusual character take everyone down a mysterious path.\n\nAt two and a half hours, the film is perhaps too long especially as the first half begins to get dull at a certain point. This thankfully changes when the story and its energy get very mysterious. Here is where the film earns many points for its uniqueness and its subtle ways to lure the viewer into its web. In a good way, this segment is rarely frightening but always intriguing. Also, class difference plays a major role but without being obviously so.\n\nThe audience is teased overall with only a minimal amount of information - just enough to understand while still yearning for more by the end. While a bit more information might have raised the film overall, it&apos;s still fair to say that the tease pays off for the most part. - dbamateurcritic",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The reason for a sequel,&quot; says Bullock, &quot;is that Marc (Lawrence, writer and producer) and I found ourselves on numerous occasions imagining what Gracie would have gone on to do after her big triumph at the pageant and how all the media attention would have affected her.&quot; Yeah. I&apos;m gonna take a wild one and say the fact that the original made over $300 million (including domestic AND worldwide gross, rentals, and DVD sales) probably had a little something to do with it as well.\n\nLet&apos;s be honest here, do you really need a review to convince you of whether or not you want to see this? Seriously, if you watch the trailer and read this review and STILL see the movie, then I don&apos;t want to hear any complaints. Walk out of the theater with a smile on your face or I&apos;ll put one there, OK? Otherwise, don&apos;t see it. Come on, you&apos;re not really expecting something fresh and original are you? Have you read the plot line? Miss Congeniality 2 obviously runs a predictable path. Gracie is originally reluctant to become Ms. FBI Barbie, but then she embraces the role and becomes a wee bit too wrapped up in it. But wait! William Shatner and Miss America are kidnapped! So it&apos;s off to Las Vegas to run a little PR. Enter Treat Williams as the Las Vegas FBI supervisor (Collins) who has ambitions of writing his own book and doesn&apos;t care for Gracie coming in and stealing his thunder. You might as well have cued the sinister music and given him a Cheshire cat to pet and a handlebar mustache to twirl.\n\nIt&apos;ll come as a shock to approximately three sub-70 IQ viewers that Collins disregards Gracie&apos;s attempts at helping and begins to steer the investigation in the wrong direction. You know what that means, right? Time for Gracie to shed the FBI Barbie image and go back to her old ways! Somebody call up Memento, and let it know that a new master of unpredictability is here and its name is Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous! OK, so not really. But who cares? The movie ramps up the cheese, the stupidity, the silliness, and the camp, and it revels in it. The best thing I can say about this sequel is it knows exactly what it is, it knows exactly what its audience wants, it knows exactly how ridiculously over-the-top everything is, and it doesn&apos;t care one whit what the critics think. There&apos;s no shame to be found here, and for that, I tip my hat.\n\nI&apos;ll be honest, if you try to put a movie like this on the shoulders of Julia Stiles or Kirsten Dunst then I&apos;m running screaming for the exit like I&apos;m Haley Joel Osment at Neverland Ranch. But I love Sandra Bullock, and she has the charm and the personality to make me smile at the stupidest stuff. She trips about 24 times, dances at a drag club in a ridiculous outfit, lays a beatin&apos; on a 6&apos;7&quot; behemoth to the tune of Spiderbait&apos;s Black Betty, and she forces me to be entertained by it. Admit it, she has a knack for making insanity absolutely adorable.\n\nOh, and who can forget the addition of a partner! Regina King (the girl from 227) is an FBI transfer with anger management issues. She&apos;s assigned as Gracie&apos;s bodyguard, and she has a bad habit of overextending herself physically. Yep, you guessed it, they don&apos;t initially get along. Can you see hijinks and shenanigans ensuing? I think you can! Is this a great movie? Not by any means. It&apos;s not even as good as the original, a big reason being that William Shatner is regretfully underutilized (although he does have a great line about his friend being run over by a milk truck). Oh, and go ahead and make sure you bring your little yellow bucket to puke in during the final scene. A producer somewhere obviously spoke up and said, &quot;Hey, we&apos;re one aww-inducing scene short of our quota,&quot; and thus the final scene was born.\n\nBut you just have to accept that and the fact that this is a comedy that&apos;ll have you shaking your head and rolling your eyes more than once. In fact, I should be ashamed to admit that I let myself enjoy it as much as I did. But if you go into the movie expecting to have a good time then you should walk out satisfied. The screening audience absolutely loved it. Granted, proclamations such as, &quot;That is the best movie I&apos;ve seen this year!&quot; are a bit much, but this is indeed a movie that knows its audience and plays to it effectively.\n\nAre you expecting high art? If so, then you really need to learn how to better analyze movie trailers. You also need to learn how to better analyze movie titles. Armed and Fabulous? One of the great absolutes in life is any time a movie tries to be cute and makes a play on words with a common phrase (in this case, &quot;armed and dangerous&quot;) in its movie title, then you better have a tent with you because mama, it&apos;s time to set up camp! The only thing missing here is a cameo by Adam West.\n\nI think I&apos;m gonna follow the trend. I&apos;m gonna write a script about baseball called America&apos;s Pastime where the home team loses the championship. However, they will get their revenge in the sequel - America&apos;s Pastime 2: Payback&apos;s a Pitch. It&apos;s gonna rule. You know it, and I know it.\n\nBottom line, America - how often in life will you get the chance to see Sandra Bullock in boxers and a t-shirt, all while sportin&apos; some long, shiny, straight hair? At the very least there is entertainment value in THAT! *sighs wistfully* Rating: 3 (out of 5)"

      "name": "Not even A-listers like Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore can save this under-developed and under-directed fantasy epic wannabe from its own tedium and mediocrity",
      "reviewBody": "Hollywood has of late had a lousy track record of fantasy action epics, and &apos;Seventh Son&apos;, which arrives just in time to close off the year, is yet another blemish to add to that list. Delayed nearly a year while its production company Legendary switched studios, this Universal release assembles A-listers Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore with &apos;The Chronicles of Narnia&apos; star Ben Barnes for an expensive big- screen adaptation of the first book of Joseph Delaney&apos;s &apos;The Wardstone Chronicles&apos; against tawdry sets and second-rate visual effects.\n\nWe aren&apos;t usually that critical of a film&apos;s production design, but there is just something awfully dreary about the widescreen world of Russian director Sergei Bodrov&apos;s debut English-language feature. Indeed, the only human city where any of the action takes place looks like it was rented right after the cast and crew of &apos;Game of Thrones&apos; abandoned it, while the mountain fortress which principal villain Mother Malkin makes her not-so-humble abode seems like it was designed for some 1960s B-grade science-fiction movie. The ugliness of these green-screened sets is even more obvious against the occasional picturesque Canadian backdrops, which cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel ably captures to evoke a majestic &apos;Lord of the Rings&apos; feel.\n\nAlas the unattractive visuals are just one of the litany of complaints that you are likely to have. What production designer Dante Ferretti fails to accomplish in sets, visual effects designer John Dykstra also fails to make up for in post-production. Whether the oversized orcs or shape-shifting witches (Moore and her fellow consort Djimon Hounsou transform into dragons, while others transform into creatures with reptilian-like tongues or Hindu deity-like arms), the CG effects for what was once intended to be a franchise tentpole are both unimaginatively conceived and poorly executed, even more appalling when viewed in post-conversion 3D or worse on an IMAX screen.\n\nAnd yet to fault its technical shortcomings seems at least a tad unfair, in particular because the movie&apos;s problems are much more fundamental. For one, despite boasting an impressive team of screenwriters including Matt Greenberg, Charles Leavitt and Steven Knight, there is hardly a story here. Without any context, we start with a younger Jeff Bridges imprisoning the Queen Witch, Mother Malkin (Moore), up in the mountains. The impending dawn of the once-a-century blood moon lends her strength to break out of her metal confines, and in an early sequence, confront her jailer Master Gregory (Bridges) and his not-so-lucky apprentice Billy (Game of Thrones&apos; Kit Harington). When that reunion ends with Billy dead, Gregory sets out recruiting a new &quot;seventh son of a seventh son&quot;, Thomas (Barnes), who so happens to be suffering from elliptic visions of Gregory and Malkin.\n\nIn narrative jargon, Thomas is The Chosen One, the anointed protégé who under the tutelage of Master Gregory will become his very equal and take his place among the elite group of knights who call themselves the Falcon. There is no doubt during the movie, even when his life seems to be in mortal danger, that Thomas will live to see the death of Mother Malkin and perhaps even the light of another sequel. There is also no doubt, despite Gregory&apos;s initial reservations, that Thomas will be ready within the span of just seven days to defeat the evil that Malkin possesses within her goth-like getup. And for that matter, there is no doubt that Thomas will find true love in Alice (Swedish actress Alicia Vikander), a witch whom he rescues from the town mob and who turns out to be the daughter of Malkin&apos;s younger sister.\n\nThe plotting is as straight-forward as it gets, and functions no more than to connect the numerous noisy action sequences together. There is also hardly any character to speak of, each one of them leading or supporting mere stock types that you would be familiar with from countless other such fantasy flicks. The latter is also why we feel sorry for Bridges, a fine actor who&apos;s played the grizzled veteran one too many times of late in &apos;R.I.P.D.&apos; and &apos;The Giver&apos; and is here trying not to sound condescending while delivering lame one-liners with a distinct twang. Moore too is an equally fine actress in her own right utterly wasted in a thankless role, and together, what chemistry the pair had in &apos;The Big Lebowski&apos; is sorely missing in their first reunion since.\n\nIf the decision to cast two acclaimed actors to lend legitimacy to the project does nothing to help the film, the casting of its younger actors also fails to do it any favours. Barnes tries his best to project fresh-eyed enthusiasm, but the late decision to cast the 31- year-old actor in the role of a 17-year-old – instead of &apos;The Hunger Games&apos;&apos; Sam Claflin is ultimately a misguided one. He also shares too little chemistry with Vikander, who looks appropriately beguiling but is little much else. Barnes and Vikander are also stuck in an awkward romance which is bound to inspire some unintended giggles especially for a sequence where the two supposedly exchange loving glances while lying together in bed. \n\nThere is hardly anything fascinating about &apos;Seventh Son&apos;, whose title belongs better in a tongue twister than in an expensive and extravagant swords-and-dragons epic. Yes, there is good reason indeed why former studio Warner Bros had dragged its feet in releasing this, and what a relief it must have felt that it need not try to justify why it decided to do so when it already has an entire trilogy in &apos;The Hobbit&apos;. No matter that the director is a two-time Academy Award nominee for his Russian films &apos;Prisoner of the Mountains&apos; and &apos;Mongol&apos;, his Hollywood foray is an embarrassing misstep that he would no doubt want to be forgotten as soon as possible. He needn&apos;t worry; to spare yourself the agony of sitting through yet another disappointing fantasy wanna-be epic, go find any one of the other sons and just avoid the Seventh."

      "name": "More about masculine emotional maturity than free solo climbing",
      "reviewBody": "A documentary about climbing solo up sheer vertical cliffs without safety ropes sounds too crazy-masculine to contain a gentle story of emotional awakening. While Free Solo (2018) celebrates athletic triumph it is also a thoughtful essay on mortality, fear, and self-identity, as it probes into the heart and mind of an elite athlete in an extreme sport.\n\nBy his mid-30s, Alex Honnold had achieved a world-class reputation for solo climbing, but despite his achievements, he was taunted by the unconquered El Capitan cliff face of Yosemite National Park. Together with an expert team of photographer climbers, he sets about the rigorous physical and mental preparation for the 3000 feet ascent. For most of the film, we watch him planning and repeatedly climbing El Capitan with safety gear, while documenting every single step and manoeuvre needed for what would be an historic free solo to the top.\n\nWhile this simple, linear narrative is predictable from the outset, the photography and character study are sublime. Panoptic drones capture close-ups of Alex on vertical granite walls, showing breathtaking toeholds in tiny recesses that barely grip. During the arduous preparation, Alex has an MRI scan that reveals an inert amygdala...a part of the brain that regulates emotion. Coming from a broken home and obsessed in his pursuit of climbing perfection, Alex has no fear and is emotionally closed. The only fear shown in the film is felt by his crew who must mentally rehearse the possibility that they will witness a close friend&apos;s death. The hitherto accident-free athlete enters a relationship with the emotionally warm, wise, and beautiful Sanni McCandless, and for the first time he experiences fall injuries.\n\nWith an easy broad smile, wide eyes, and vulnerable humility, Alex is a very likeable young man. His blossoming relationship with Sanni unfolds with childlike simplicity and growing emotional responsibility, while they are both aware that free soloing El Capitan means Alex will always be one slip from certain death. This fly-on-the-wall documentary eavesdrops on a few private moments to reveal a dilemma: Alex&apos;s dormant emotional self is being stirred, but he must overcome it to face what is a super-human challenge.\n\nSome viewers will notice the unbounded selfishness required to put others through the stress of Alex&apos;s personal pursuit while he is relatively free from the constraints of human emotion. Others will see Alex as a heroic protagonist in his own tortured life journey, or maybe wonder what bravery means if one feels no fear. No doubt there are other viewpoints and readings of this film. Regardless of what message you take, this is a riveting story, brilliantly filmed amongst some of the most stunning mountain scenery you will ever see.",

So is the great scenery and best-of-all, a great action story that has you focused intently for the full two hours.\n\nA human characteristic so often ignored in films the past half century is put on display here: compassionate forgiveness. Seeing forgiveness demonstrated instead of revenge is almost shocking to see. Kudos to the filmmakers, too, for not going overboard on the brutality in this adventure.",

Strange Days is really atmospheric, clever, and has aged well in some ways. It&apos;s like a combination of Blade Runner and Minority Report. The camera work is absolutely amazing in nearly every scene, you would notice that early from the first scene, which shows a restaurant hold-up completely from a criminal&apos;s perspective. The film gets very dark half-way through (so this film is not really for the faint of heart) and then ends in a chaotic but satisfying way. I recommend it to sci-fi and thriller fans, but it&apos;s not for everyone.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Kraftidioten&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;In order of Disappearance&quot;, is a brilliant 2014 black comedy/vigilante thriller from Norway. Since a lot of people in this world object to reading subtitles (and simply because it&apos;s an easy and profitable business), Hollywood is always eager to produce remakes of successful foreign movies. For once, however, I didn&apos;t immediately feel like boycotting the US remake; and this for two reasons. Number one: native Norwegian Hans Petter Moland directs the American remake himself and, number two, none other than the awesome Liam Neeson reprises the role of the grieving but vengeful father. Apart from different people in the cast, obviously, &quot;Cold Pursuit&quot; is practically a shot-by-shot remake of &quot;In order of Disappearance. The setting has moved from snowy Norway to snowy Colorado, and the drug wars are fought with Native American tribes instead of with Albanian mafia families, but the plot of the quiet and introvert plow driver seeking retaliation for the murder of his innocent son is identical. This basically means that &quot;Cold Pursuit&quot; is still an awesomely entertaining action movie with sublime dry humor, but the freshness and the surprise elements are gone (unless if you haven&apos;t seen the Norwegian original, duh).",

      "reviewBody": "I was thrilled to see a movie like &quot;Wolf Creek&quot; come out in theatres: a straightforward horror film not relying on clever twists (except one, small one) or gimmicks. It was the kind of film &quot;High Tension&quot; started off as before that last act mindf*ck. And while I ended up appreciating what that movie did, I would have loved it more without the twist.\n\n&quot;Wolf Creek&quot; picks up where films like &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; and &quot;Last House on the Left&quot; left off, without feeling the need to necessarily &quot;pay homage&quot; to them. I wonder if the fact that it&apos;s not American-made has anything to do with that. I also wonder if the non-American influence kept this from becoming predictable or familiar in any way. What you think is going to happen in this film never quite happens. One of the original &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; taglines was, &quot;Who Will Survive and What Will Be Left of Them?&quot; I think this film asks the same question, but doesn&apos;t provide so simple an answer.\n\nI think it&apos;s best to know little about &quot;what happens&quot; here before seeing it. Most people know the basics--three backpackers on a road trip, they stop at remote Wolf Creek, entering an odd Twilight Zone of stopped time and dead car engines. A friendly bushman stops by willing to help, let the nightmare begin.\n\nI love that director/writer/producer Greg McLean never offers an explanation for the watches and the car engine. What happens in this film seems almost alien--three humans struggling to survive on what appears like a distant, barren planet, up against a hunter with no semblance of humanity in him. Yes, this movie is very similar to &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre,&quot; but it is in no way a rip-off. While the early-morning showdown on the barren road may look similar to the climax of TCM, it is its own nightmarish entity. In fact, some of the scene reminded me of &quot;Duel.&quot; The acting in this movie is brilliant. The three leads--Ben, Kristi, and Liz--are so wonderfully likable, and there is an odd feeling of improvisation in the acting. It&apos;s so natural, it seems impossible to script. When everything goes to hell, you want all three of them to survive, and you&apos;ll surely be devastated by the slightest injury any of them endures. Many have complained about the hour or so of build up, but I think it was brilliant on McLean&apos;s part to make sure we cared about these people, and then to put them through the wringer. It&apos;s sadistic, too, emotionally, but it&apos;s the sign of a great director.\n\nJohn Jarratt, as Mick, is unforgettably cruel. Jarratt embodies this character from head to toe, and is fearless in his performance. Mick is an ugly, cruel man, and yet when we first meet him, he seems like the nicest guy in the world. One of the scariest aspects to this film is that you can see yourself falling for all of his tricks.\n\nTo be honest, I never want to see &quot;Wolf Creek&quot; again. It&apos;s not a fun movie. I left wanting to hate it, because I hated what happened. But I admire this movie for what it managed to do. I truly had to keep repeating to myself, &quot;It&apos;s only a movie,&quot; (the infamous &quot;Last House on the Left&quot; tagline) but it&apos;s so realistic and so unflinching in portraying what happens, that you&apos;ll feel as if someone was always peeking around a corner with a camera, filming an actual event. Of course, this is based on true events, and frankly, there is some discrepancy to how &quot;true&quot; this film tries to be (obviously, much of the second act had to be dramatized, and you&apos;ll realize why once you see the movie) but it didn&apos;t need that &quot;based on true events&quot; tag. It&apos;s already very real.\n\nI hate to end on the old &quot;Jaws&quot; cliché, but as I am going to Australia soon, I can say for a fact that this does do for backpacking what &quot;Jaws&quot; did for swimming. I consider this movie a parable of sorts. Well done.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Anyone can be tailor.&quot; Leonard (Mark Rylance)\n\nAlthough sometimes I can&apos;t tell if I love film more than theater, with The Outfit I found a film that satisfies both affections. Writer-director Grahame Moore brings a Hitchcock frame of mind with one dominant location, an atelier holding no more than four or five characters, just like a theater stage, and a sense of foreboding coming from history and the characters themselves, just like the modern psychological thrillers do.\n\nJust watch out for those scissors-Hitch would love the touch.\n\nUnderneath the simple set is a rumbling of sin as the meek tailor, Leonard, contends with three mobs threatening him and his secretary, Mable (Zoey Deutch). He is required to stitch around those who want to kill each other and destroy his business, with different crooks coming in the front door intent on finding a tape that allegedly would send them to jail.\n\nThe joy of this neo-noir thriller is the suspense that Hitchcock virtually patented because his non-mob characters are seemingly innocent types, and his sinners not quite in control of their ambitions. What Hitch and other thriller directors like Moore want is to show the vulnerability of the common citizen and the weaknesses of the seasoned mobsters.\n\nAlthough it&apos;s up to Leonard, small haberdashery owner in Chicago, to protect his shop, he also, in a narcotic-like voice over, explains the allegorical implications of his cutting and sewing. For instance, he is not a tailor but rather a cutter. The former artless, the latter a professional trained for years on London&apos;s iconic Saville Row.\n\nNo recent film has surpassed The Outfit&apos;s ability to reveal the wickedness of humanity and its adaptability while supplying a dose of old-time noir. Delight in the spare set, the super acting, and the innumerable closeups that do as much to reveal character as the uncomplicated, Pinter-like dialogue.\n\nAlthough this tidy feature, similar to Leonard in its meticulous revelation of character and motive, seems suited to streaming, it is a euphoric experience on the big screen as the spare audiences can be enveloped by the powerful characters and story, in a setting that puts all in a dynamic room with mystery aplenty."

      "reviewBody": "When I read all the comments about Zwartboek, it becomes clear to me that either you like the movie or you kind of hate it. What is that with good and bad that we want to make an exact line... This whole movie is about not knowing if you can do bad things (kill, betray or whatever) to achieve the good. Or the other way around off course. I must admit that the movie is (again) explicit, but aren&apos;t all the Dutch movies? What strikes me most is that some people expect to get a movie in which everything is clear. I think this is a movie which should set us to thinking: what would I do if I were in the same situation. Paul Verhoeven made clear with this movie that in the end, lots of people act for their own prosperity. It&apos;s just what you make people around you believe... I think in lots of countries people acted like this, none of the countries however dared to make a movie out of it. To me this movie is again (as Soldaat van Oranje and for instance De Tweeling)a beautiful one about WWII without getting boring. A smart story with two faces. Although some of the actors don&apos;t really fit into a masterpiece like this, I give it a great compliment. Get over the explicit name calling (ever seen Pulp Fiction??) and appreciate the scenery and nice camera-work, the great plot change and you&apos;ll have a great time and may even reconsider your own ideas about the resistance!",

As Johnny grapples with his psychic visions and attempts to prevent impending tragedies, The Dead Zone delves into themes of fate, free will, and the moral gray areas that arise from possessing extraordinary gifts. With a riveting narrative and a thought-provoking exploration of the human condition, The Dead Zone solidifies its place as a must-watch in the realm of supernatural cinema, offering a chilling and introspective experience that transcends the boundaries of its genre.",

Debutant director Aditya Chopra so perfectly brings these two together at the back-drop of a realistic family setting that its hard not to fall in love with them. Its chemistry at its finest. For Srk it was his first &quot;Raj&quot; character(play-girl type guy with the right values and morals) which he plays to perfection. For Kajol, DDLJ was a career making movie. As Simran she&apos;s beautiful, sweet, sensitive and a bit stuck-up too. Thank god Madhuri didn&apos;t have the dates to work in DDLJ cuz no actress suits Srk better then Kajol. There are countless heart-warming scenes between em&apos; in DDLJ. Each one of them is uniquely different and just as much fun to watch. The entire setting of DDLJ is very simplistic, which brings out that special &quot;oomph&quot; in their romance. The songs are first-class. The strong supporting cast of Amrish Puri, Farida Jalal, Anupam Kher and Satish Shah definitely helped the movie to become the classic as its now seen as.\n\nBottomline: DDLJ is &apos;romantic comedy&apos; with Indian emotions at its peak. From the cast, chemistry, music, direction and the awesome pairing of Srk-Kajol....its perfect!",

The cast are all good enough, although they were probably chosen as much for their looks as their acting abilities, but who can deny that Jessica Alba and Ashley Scott did add a sexy feel for the male audience, and i guess Paul Walker and Scott Caan did the same for the ladies.\n\nWhat really made the film for me was the truly fantastic scenery and the underwater camera work; it was flawless and stunningly beautiful in a way that is rarely captured on film, three cheers for the direction and the film crew for that.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "I had high hopes for this film, since I have been a big fan of the novel on which it is based. The film exceeded my expectations in every way. Although quite faithful to the book (with many lines of dialogue and narration moving straight from Scott Heim&apos;s poetic prose), the movie has more drive and focus and pulls you so far into the troubled characters. Credit for the movie&apos;s strength goes all around -- director Araki put his mark on the story without taking it over. He got uniformily good performances (and somehow managed to direct scenes that any reader of the book would have thought completely unfilmable). Kansas has never looked better, or more sinister. The music is used well throughout.\n\nAnd the acting is terrific. The two youngest leads, Chase Ellison and George Webster, were entirely convincing in their scenes (and I hope they feel proud of their work, seeing as how there&apos;s no way they&apos;ll get to see this movie until sometime next decade). Michelle Trachtenberg and Jeff Licon have fairly thankless roles, playing characters who are somewhat less clear and crucial in the film than their characters were in the book. But they don&apos;t sweat that, they just play what the screen play has them do, and they excel. Licon, especially, I think, although Trachtenberg is at a disadvantage, as her part is really pretty small.\n\nAnd for me, at least, I think Mary-Lynn Rajskub, Brady Corbet, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt give about as good performances as one can give. Rajskub is so good that she gives the other actors in the film a space to react that is almost visible. Corbet is quiet and intense; if his performance sometimes lacks motivation, it is probably deliberate, as his character is struggling with identity and memory. And as for Gordon-Levitt, man, that guy can act. I really have a hard time thinking of any acting performance ever that has affected me as much.\n\nIt is a difficult story, although I felt it ends hopefully. Hopefully, you will agree. Content is very strong, although perhaps not NC-17 strong. Not for kids. Adults, if you can get past the 2nd scene, you can get through it, but there is a lot of outlawed sexuality and violence. It is painful to watch at times, but to me at least, that&apos;s because the actors and the director managed to immerse me in the characters.",

Pamela Anderson's role is well-received, yet the supporting cast and plot garner mixed reviews. While the film attempts to capture the original's spirit, critics note it falls short in humor and cleverness. Jokes are deemed less sharp, and pacing is uneven. The movie relies heavily on nostalgia and doesn’t innovate enough, making it an enjoyable yet imperfect revival of the franchise.",

      "reviewBody": "Parody is a delicate business. Done well, it dances the line between homage and mockery, sharp enough to skewer its target but light enough to make you laugh while it does. Films like Mel Brooks&apos; &apos;Blazing Saddles&apos;, Robert Moore&apos;s &apos;Murder by Death&apos; and Woody Allen&apos;s &apos;Love &amp; Death&apos; are precision-engineered chaos, made by people who deeply understood and admired not just the genres, but the conventions, clichés and cultural fixations they were lampooning.\n\nSome of the very best came from the trio of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker (or ZAZ), whose work helped defined the modern spoof. Their &apos;Airplane!&apos; is madcap magic, while the short lived &apos;Police Squad!&apos; distilled that same manic energy into television, only to be cancelled before its time. Later resurrected with &apos;The Naked Gun&apos; films, they introduced the world to Detective Lieutenant Frank Drebin- played with deadpan genius by Leslie Nielsen- remaining to this day a joke-a-second riot.\n\nThey&apos;re brilliantly stupid films, and, as Steve Martin once remarked &quot;stupid comedy is the hardest kind of comedy to do.&quot; The kind of spoof ZAZ perfected demands impeccable timing and intelligent gags, offering a delicate balance between silliness and sincerity, as well as a cast who can deliver absurd lines with total conviction- without tipping into unintentional farce. They&apos;re incredibly difficult to pull off; but the results can be gold.\n\nHowever, somewhere along the line, spoof became a byword for cheap, crass comedy. In the wake of earlier greats came odious, unfunny husks like Ezio Greggio&apos;s &apos;The Silence of the Hams,&apos; the increasingly worthless &apos;Scary Movie&apos; flicks- three of which inexplicably involved David Zucker as either writer or director- and the irredeemable work of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Louder, cruder and ear-achingly dull, films like these confused volume for wit and reference for punchline, dragging a once-great genre into the gutter.\n\nCan spoof make a comeback with Akiva Schaffer&apos;s rebooted &apos;The Naked Gun,&apos; or is his film just another attempt to cash-in on a beloved IP? Written by Schaffer, Dan Gregor and Doug Mand, the film follows Frank Drebin Jr., who- just like his father before him- is a deadpan disaster magnet, whose loyalty to Police Squad is only matched by his talent for causing chaos. After foiling a bank robbery and meeting the sultry Beth Davenport, Drebin finds himself battling to save not just his beloved precinct from closure, but the human race itself.\n\nJohnny Carson often said &quot;it&apos;s more difficult to make somebody laugh than it is to make them think,&quot; and Schaffer struggles to do either. His film doesn&apos;t take itself seriously, revelling in silliness; though none of the gags reach the heights of the original Frank Drebin&apos;s exploits. There are a few genuine laugh-out-loud moments, but the whole affair lacks the intelligence, precision and breakneck comic momentum that made &apos;The Naked Gun&apos; a classic. It&apos;s funny at times, yes- but never truly smart and never quite sharp enough to stick.\n\nSchaffer&apos;s reboot often feels closer in spirit to the lesser spoofs Leslie Nielsen appeared in during his later career- films like &apos;2001: A Space Travesty&apos; or &apos;Spy Hard&apos;- where humour leaned heavily on low-hanging fruit and gags overstayed their welcome. It shares that same scattergun approach, hurling jokes at the screen with such desperation that when one lands, it almost feels accidental. Too often, a decent comic setup is run into the ground, scenes dragging on well past their punchline, drained of any real impact.\n\nNarratively, it&apos;s a serviceable but uninspired affair. The plot- involving a global threat, a ticking clock and a precinct on the brink of shutdown- feels like a generic framework stretched to accommodate a parade of gags, rather than a tightly structured story in its own right. Schaffer, Gregor and Mand clearly understand the formula, but the film lacks the zany unpredictability and momentum that once made Police Squad feel like it was perpetually on the verge of collapse- in the best way possible.\n\nAnecdotally, in the screening this reviewer attended, a man in the audience laughed so hysterically one couldn&apos;t help but wonder about his mental state. For him, the film was clearly comedic gold, as it very well may be for many. However, for those familiar with the TV show that spawned the franchise (and the whip-smart lunacy of the original films) this reboot can&apos;t help but feel like a broad, loud imitation.\n\nProduction-wise, the film is slick, looking and sounding like a bona fide big-budget thriller, with the kind of polish that gives everything a professional sheen. Brandon Trost&apos;s cinematography occasionally flirts with noir- dramatic lighting, shadowy compositions- hinting at a visual intelligence the script doesn&apos;t always match. Furthermore, to its credit, the action is crisply choreographed, executed with real momentum, while Lorne Balfe&apos;s score is stirring. However, Brian Scott Olds&apos; editing results in pacing issues. Some scenes overstay their welcome, milking gags long past their expiry date. In comedy, timing is everything- here, a tighter cut could&apos;ve made all the difference.\n\nHaving said that, Liam Neeson is terrific as the deadpan Drebin Jr., perfectly capturing the straight-faced absurdity essential to the role. His comic timing is excellent, at times managing to evoke the spirit of Leslie Nielsen&apos;s iconic performance without resorting to mere imitation. Neeson is no stranger to comedy, excelling in &apos;Life&apos;s Too Short&apos; and &apos;A Million Ways to Die in the West;&apos; here, he carries the film with a steady mix of dry charm and deadpan wit, keeping it afloat amid the chaos.\n\nPamela Anderson is similarly great as Beth Davenport, Drebin&apos;s love interest. Breathless and sultry, she brings an earnestness to the part that makes her straight-faced delivery genuinely funny. Like Prisicilla Presley before her, Anderson plays it completely straight, adding a charming counterbalance to the film&apos;s silliness. She and Neeson share a warm chemistry that feels natural and effortless.\n\nDanny Huston makes for an effective villain, chewing the scenery with gusto. Imbuing the character with a certain gravelly authority- equal parts menace and theatrical flair- he has never sounded more like his late, great father John. Huston knows exactly what kind of film he&apos;s in, leaning into the absurd without losing his imposing edge. CCH Pounder and Paul Walter Hauser are also good, though underused, while two beloved stars from the original films make brief, but memorable, cameos.\n\nAkiva Schaffer&apos;s &apos;The Naked Gun&apos; is a knowingly daft affair- loud, chaotic and proudly unserious. Although highly polished, it doesn&apos;t match the razor-sharp wit or tight pacing that made the original films, and especially &apos;Police Squad!&apos; so beloved. It reminds one of the vast difference between Mel Brooks&apos; &apos;Young Frankenstein&apos;- a lovingly crafted genre send-up with real comic bite- and his later &apos;Dracula: Dead and Loving It&apos;, which had all the ingredients but none of the spark. There&apos;s fun to be had, and Neeson and Anderson give it their all; but, in the end, &apos;The Naked Gun&apos; is hit-and-miss- mostly shooting blanks.",

That man---Jack Nicholson (always on a lucky streak it seems). Wicked little comedy with Jack going over the top and having great fun with the helter-skelter material. The women (Cher and Sarandon in particular) match his intensity and the star power makes up for the crazed screenplay and unsteady direction by George Miller. Overall I liked &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot;. I am not quite sure why I did, but once again Nicholson proves that if there is just enough substance available that he can raise mediocre film-making techniques and share the spotlight with his fellow co-stars. 4 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "A life of crime. Are some people genetically predisposed to crime or is it all about choices?\n\nIn this hard hitting drama, we follow the rise and fall of Richard Kuklinski played utterly convincingly by Michael Shannon. The man who terrorised many, yet he was a faithful and devoted dad and husband where the constant struggle is shown in keeping the balance between a life of crime and family harmony.\n\nOne scene I find particularly mesmerising is when he visits his brother in prison and as he is about to leaves his brother shouts that since are both born criminals they shall both end up in jail.\n\nKudos to the makers for conveying tension and emotion in the correct dose. My only remark would be that it kind of lost its way between being a crime drama and autobiography, however whilst it successfully is a bit of both, I sort of craved it picked a genre and dig a little deeper."

My dad was a seasonal fanatic of sports and kept updating me with the news from the papers/sports magazines and the television. \n\nTo relive the moments of Ayrton (the idol) in this emotionally gripping documentary was unbelievably comforting. The script and flow of the events were so flawlessly presented taking one&apos;s memory into the Time travel of decade gone by. It was nothing short of Excellence in execution. \n\nThe documentary dissects Ayton&apos;s persona in a subtle way, making it the most compelling Biography of all times. The back-ground score by Antonio Pinto was Enthralling and Sensual delight. \n\nThis is not to be missed, sad that I had been to the cinema only on the final day when it was shown-much regret the delay. Nevertheless, Its a true Masterpiece which portrays the subtle sadness of a legend&apos;s demise in a sweet throat stifling moments.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s quite noticeable that Dreamworks Animation is trying to break visual grounds in their most recent movies, but Mr. Peabody and Sherman gives a little reminder on their original magic. The first half shows how charming the worlds they can bring even without shoving too much spectacles, the characters bursting out absurd personality that may sometimes be senseless yet terribly affable. But of course, it&apos;s an adventure traveling through historical events, but it kind of falls short on the concept and rather places those things into a bumpy ride with a dramatic center. Those things could have worked if it was more sincere, but the real enjoyment lies on the basics where you let the mockeries and the humor speak.\n\nThere is a nice additional depth behind the quirky and interesting relationship of the two, it makes their reintroduction on screen feel a lot fresh. The growth of their connection kicks in the plot, and that is when it starts becoming a bit forced. It doesn&apos;t seem comfortable with heightening the material. Turning things big and emotional is more like a must for the film to have because apparently that is what most animation today usually strive for. None of it actually plummets things down, but the story is probably better off smaller. People should remember the studio is more than trippy visuals and celebrity voices, in the end it&apos;s the simple witty humor that provides the genuine color in their movies.\n\nThe plot here should have focused more on the intersection between education and parody within the historical settings than building epic proportions in its little plot. The typical elements are still fun. Ty Burrell is dashing as Mr. Peabody even with the seriousness that embodies the character do too sparks a sense of heart. The entire cast delivers the comedy admirably and it really leaves the viewers hungry for more. The zany effects kind of interrupts most of that, but the animation is still great overall. The designs are wonderfully loyal to its cartoony essence which is one of the striking things to pay close attention to.\n\nMr. Peabody and Sherman is completely fun when it doesn&apos;t try following the modern roots of the genre. It&apos;s a lot brilliant when it&apos;s just traveling time, meeting a caricatured version of a particular historical figure, stopping candles, and let the personalities of the characters develop on their own without being too didactic. The relationship of Peabody and Sherman is already compelling at the start, but they could have think of better choices to justify its center. There are still plenty of strong stuff worth seeing around, it just needs to be cleverer.",

Every ten minutes somebody dies in an elaborate fashion that nonetheless lacks the ingenuity or suspense of the &quot;Final Destination&quot; (or even &quot;Saw&quot;) movies because it&apos;s all played as a joke. Even that would be fine if the director really had a flair for jaunty black comedy--something like early Coen brothers--or spectacular bad-taste slapstick. But he doesn&apos;t, so this just comes off as one dumb gag after another, played out by characters who are all cartoonishly one-dimensional, so there&apos;s zero emotional stake in their fates.\n\nI enjoyed at least some of Perkins&apos; prior movies, but this reminded me that the weakest thing about Stephen King books and writing is when they&apos;re trying to be funny (think &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot;), which is not his strong suit. It&apos;s better crafted than a lot of low-budget movies in a similar vein, but given that it&apos;s not particularly low-budget and involves some talented people, its ideas should be better than that of your average lowbrow gore comedy. I was very disappointed. If my expectations had been lower, I would have found it an okay throwaway movie--but even so, one that&apos;s neither particularly clever or scary, just sort of mildly amusing.",

It was a bit of a distraction in the original.\n\nBreslin is a great child actor. She is the big improvement over the original. She and Zeta-Jones have a compelling story. The romance with Aaron Eckhart is a little lacking. He has limited chemistry with Zeta-Jones. They&apos;re also relying on a few too many montages.

      "reviewBody": "After reading some bad reviews I come to the conclusion there are a lot of bitter people. People that I would not like to be around. Humorless people with only one goal in their life and that is bitching and complaining. Wanderlust is one of those movies that will always bring a smile on my face. Not a shy smile like with some other comedies, but big laughter, certainly with some hilarious scenes. Especially the one where Paul Rudd is getting ready to get late in front of a mirror. Sometimes with my wife we actually play that scene over. It&apos;s one of those scenes you will never forget and that says enough about this comedy. Wanderlust has a good cast, an original story, but most of all it has a lot of funny moments. And that&apos;s what it is all about when you watch a lighthearted comedy.",

The film is praised for its emotional depth, humor, and the portrayal of family bonds. However, criticisms include changes to key characters and plot elements, such as the removal of Gantu and the altered role of Jumba, which some reviewers feel dilute the original's charm and message. The pacing and editing are also noted as areas where the film falls short, with some scenes feeling rushed or unnecessary. Despite these issues, many reviewers find the film enjoyable and a decent addition to the Disney live-action remakes, though it may not fully capture the magic of the original animated classic.",

      "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s start with this: the original &apos;Lilo &amp; Stitch&apos; is one of my favourite cartoons ever. It&apos;s pure magic - quirky, heartfelt, and beautifully weird in that way only early 2000s Disney could get away with. So when I heard there was a live-action remake in the works, I had cautious hope. But after sitting through this 2025 adaptation... I wish I&apos;d never seen it.\n\nThis remake is not nearly as good as the original. In fact, it barely feels like it&apos;s trying to be. Iconic moments have been cut or warped beyond recognition - smoothed over into something bland and safe. And don&apos;t get me started on Stitch himself - still voiced by Chris Sanders, yes, but it feels hollow without the wild energy that made him so lovable.\n\nSome of the changes just make no sense. Characters are tweaked in ways that add nothing, and the emotional heart of the story - Lilo&apos;s grief, her loneliness, her oddball charm - has been neutered. The film is both rushed AND drags on, somehow managing to feel overstuffed and undercooked all at once. A true feat, if it wasn&apos;t so frustrating to watch.\n\nUltimately, it feels like a soulless cash grab. Another in a long line of Disney remakes that mistake visual fidelity for emotional resonance. It&apos;s got all the polish of a high-budget project, but none of the spirit. I didn&apos;t smile, I didn&apos;t cry - I just kept checking my watch.\n\nHonestly? I&apos;m at the point where I won&apos;t even bother watching the live-action remake of Moana, or whatever else they&apos;re churning out next. I&apos;m so over the fakeness. These aren&apos;t love letters to our childhoods - they&apos;re boardroom products dressed up in nostalgia.\n\nNO MORE. Let our animated classics stay classics. They don&apos;t need &quot;updating.&quot; They just need to be left alone.",

Perfectly mastered and set up, each event and scene were coordinated way before and therefore made it even more perfect. I loved every minute of it!

      "reviewBody": "Digging deep into the thoughts and dreams of mortals and the angels who look after them, WINGS OF DESIRE is a masterfully-made work of art and Germany&apos;s finest. It matches lavish cinematography, flawless direction by Wim Winders, impressive performances and a simple plot told with such brilliance, symbolism and will.\n\nThe first half of the film resembles more like a beautifully-painted mosaic or an avant-garde film showing empathy for every character brought about by the screen even showing traces of the Nazism era. Here, the idea of supernatural beings that indirectly assist humans in day-to-day life is introduced. The mystifying beings are unseen to everyone except to the young-at-heart. Hovering atop statues or wandering inside public libraries or apartments, they see and know everything as Winders etches the black-and-white world of the angels. The story evolves when one angel Damiel (Bruno Ganz) wonders what it is like to be human, how it is like to be able to feel, to hold or to be seen. Once he comes to the aid of attractive trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he feels a spiritual devotion he has never felt before.\n\nWinders&apos; slow-but-steady rate gives time for the viewer to contemplate on the questions a child asks (&quot;Why am I me and why not you? Why am I here and not there? When did time begin and where did space end?&quot;). He allows the audience members think what they want to think in a new light instead of manipulating them. The scenario of a ghostly being falling for a human may seem overworked now (GHOST, JUST LIKE HEAVEN) but WINGS OF DESIRE is a fresh, innovative piece of cinema with remarkable photography and unbelievable performances. Henry Alekan&apos;s cinematography is both insightful and visually dazzling. Every camera angle takes on a new connotation. Ganz and Dommartin are equally irresistible as two different &quot;people&quot;, who worlds apart from each other; both characters are looking for love, no matter how close Damien is from Marion. Peter Falk, playing himself, is an amusing attribute to the cast being &quot;Columbo&quot; in the popular TV show. Being a mysterious character himself, he metaphorically adds a little color to the film amidst all the spellbinding drama and discloses an entertaining revelation that helps the film progress.\n\nThis revolutionary masterpiece of craftsmanship is considered by many as the greatest non-US movie ever and it deserves all of its praise entirely. WINGS OF DESIRE breaks new ground in romantic and dramatic film making. Every scene in this movie offers a chance for hope, understanding and compassion. Unbearably creative, outstanding and poignant, this superbly-made motion picture is not another art-house flick. Astounding.\n\nWINGS OF DESIRE was remade in Hollywood as the sleek yet disappointing CITY OF ANGELS(1997)."

They finally went back to what worked in the first couple of Scary Movies - they followed a plot from a single movie and just made fun of it. There were a couple of side notes but they still linked in quite well to the overall plot. Even with a couple of try-hard comedic moments, the story flowed well and it wasn&apos;t a clumsy mish-mash of anything and everything to do with superhero movies. I was laughing most of the way through.\n\nI&apos;d recommend it to anyone who liked the first couple of Scary Movies.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;If a bank forecloses on you, don&apos;t move and demand they produce a copy of your mortgage. In many cases, they can&apos;t.&quot; Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio)\n\nIn the course of the angry and benignly biased documentary, Inside Job, Marcy Kaptur predicts what is happening right now: Banks are being forced to halt foreclosures because of faulty paperwork. But such mistakes are only a symptom Charles Ferguson reveals of the 2008 world-wide financial crisis, which involves high-ranking government officials like Larry Summers and Timothy Geithner increasing their power while the policies they make cause certain harm to the people like us who have trusted them.\n\nLike Fergusin&apos;s No End in Sight about the Iraq War, but more interesting and dramatic, Inside Job lays out logically the participation also of George Bush and Barack Obama in the global meltdown. Dispiriting are the derivative dispersal and shameful sub-prime lending that directly led to the breakdown of middle-class wealth while the purveyors of this massacre walked away with billions and no indictments. The Ponzi schemes of Kenneth Lay, Bernie Madoff, and their ilk are but small components of the charade that drew millions of hard-working, well-meaning citizens into debt and financial ruin as the value of their most cherished retirement vehicle, home value, dissipated right in front of their eyes.\n\nFerguson&apos;s documentary style is to remain behind the camera while letting the notables indict themselves. Unlike Michael Moore, he cares not to intrude or make a character of himself, something like Citizen Kane&apos;s reporter Thompson. Except when in a moment of profound pique he challenges the disaffection of Frederic Mishkin, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors: &quot;I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m sure that your textbook is important and widely read, but didn&apos;t you think that more important things were going on in the world?&quot;\n\nUnlike the recent screed of Davis Guggenheim against organized education in Waiting for Superman, in which teachers&apos; unions could do no right and charter schools no wrong, Ferguson seems more honest in presenting only the facts. As I demanded of him to present the other side of the financial crisis, I couldn&apos;t think of what he could say to counter the welter of facts indicting those in front of his camera.\n\nOne of the most telling moments is that of Bush&apos;s Chief Economic Adviser, Glenn Hubbard: &quot;You have three more minutes. Give it your best shot!&quot; That arrogance informs the documentary and our grim lives for the foreseeable future."

It was a ride, a very scary, very stressful ride, but an awesome one. True, this flick does not stray far from the typical zombie flick concepts, but I thought the execution was above par. The 1st person views, the sense of confinement/hopelessness, and the great acting (especially ms carpenter, extremely believable job of someone going hysterically frantic) One of the key things about this horror is the scares never let up, there is rarely a &quot;breather scene&quot; where you get to relax for any amount of time, it just keeps hitting you and hitting you.\n\nhaha, phew. I truly enjoyed. check it out. cheers",

He wants to teach them team work and to take their minds off gangs and to also learn respect. Since a lot of juveniles return back to their gangs or prison again or end up dead. This movie does send a good message to the youth who are incarcerated. That they can become better people if they are given a second chance.

      "reviewBody": "Watching the 1998 THE SIEGE in 2007 and then rolling through all the reviews of this film from the time of release to the present is a lesson in the power of the cinema. The obvious initial response was less about the film as a film than about the manner in which the FBI, CIA, Military, Terrorists, and public responded to the unimaginable: shouts of protests about &apos;glorification of occult terrorists&apos;, the Hollywood idea of the impossible happening, and the criticism of the fine cast of actors who steeped into roles &apos;beyond swallowing&apos; are all here in these reviews.\n\nNow, six years after 9/11 reviewers are taking a different view, though most still find the film pompous and obnoxious. Offensive versus defensive. And after viewing the movie as a movie it is gratifying to know that people feel strongly and are vocal about the depiction of the &apos;war against terrorism&apos; we continue to lose. Movies that make people think and talk are valuable, and in that light the film is more successful than initially considered.\n\nYes, there are gaping holes in the script and the plot and the concept, but as a little thriller it maintains our attention throughout and offers some fine moments from actors such as Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Tony Shalhoub, Bruce Willis, Sami Bouajila, Ahmed Ben Larby, Aasif Mandvi among others. And then there are the panoramas of New York City under siege with the Twin Towers standing mightily in the cityscape... It begs the question: if scriptwriter Lawrence Wright and director Edward Zwick (Blood Diamond, The Last Samurai, Courage Under Fire, Glory, Leaving Normal, Legends of the Fall, etc) were thinking along these lines and finding flaws in our intelligence forces, why weren&apos;t the leaders in Washington, DC in tune with &apos;absurd possibilities&apos;? It makes one think - and that is the best thing about this film. Grady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "This film seems to me to lack balance between the combination of elements that it blends together: the thriller-suspense factor, the gore, and the &quot;surprise&quot; factor. It is a very irregular film, but it still boasts good style and good manners in atmosphere-building, even if it doesn&apos;t really live up to meet the expectations, at least for me.\n\nThe story goes about Marie and Alexia, best friends who drive up to Alexia&apos;s parents&apos; countryside house, hoping to find some peace for studying. Instead, they&apos;ll have to fight a psychopathic killer in a macabre cat-and-mouse game.\n\nThe best part, in my opinion, is the mise-en-scene and the introduction of the characters and the storyline. Everything in those first sequences tells us that something horrible is going to happen, not only because we already know that we&apos;re watching a horror film. The dusty road, the scorching weather, the big corn fields... the real feel of a horror story scene is there. It increases with the night scenes, the shots of the house, the staircase, the corridors. The gloominess and inherent darkness of the place and the quiet surroundings perfectly do their job of preparing us for what&apos;s to come.\n\nThe story-telling loses steam after this part. Not being a big fan of gore, I didn&apos;t really care for the bloody murder scenes, but I&apos;m sure that they&apos;ll be appreciated by many -they&apos;re rather truculent and well filmed. The duel between Marie and the killer didn&apos;t really work for me; in fact, I found it a little boring. On the whole, I thought the story was unoriginal and predictable, but, contrary to what many say, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s deceitful -I didn&apos;t feel that the director cheats on the audience with the ending. (I won&apos;t elaborate on this so as not to spoil the film for those who want to see it).\n\nI have mixed feelings about &quot;High Tension&quot;. On the one hand, for me, it is ineffective as a thriller, and flawed as an exercise of story-telling. On the other, however, the murky atmosphere and the darkness of the story and of its subtleties stuck with me for a while after seeing the film. I wouldn&apos;t watch it again, but I understand why many like it so much."

      "reviewBody": "I recently rewatched the UK 🇬🇧 picture Doomsday (2008) on Tubi. The storyline unfolds in Scotland, quarantined due to a deadly virus outbreak, resulting in a world of violence and cannibalism. As a similar virus emerges in London 30 years later, evidence suggests the cure lies in Scotland, leading to a team sent to retrieve it at any cost.\n\nWritten and directed by Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers), the film stars Rhona Mitra (Underworld: Rise of the Lycans), Bob Hoskins (Danny the Dog), Vernon Willemse (Mad Max: Fury Road), and Alexander Siddig (21 Bridges).\n\nWhile always a fun watch, the movie falls short in terms of overall execution. The plot combines elements of Mad Max, Death Race 2000, and Medieval Times, with a puzzling castle 🏰 and renaissance ending. However, the kill scenes shine with excellent gore, blood splatter, and exploding heads. The soundtrack, is very good, but falters at the end by using the same song as &quot;28 Days Later,&quot; making the conclusion feel cheesy and somewhat of a ripoff.\n\nIn conclusion, Doomsday is a must-see for action genre enthusiasts and apocalypse fans. I&apos;d rate it 6/10 and strongly recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "Scary Movie V (2013) \n\nBOMB (out of 4) \n\nWow, an American comedy from 2013 that makes INAPPROPRIATE COMEDY seem a little funnier. I&apos;m not even going to waste my time giving any sort of plot synapses because this thing is just so horridly bad that you can&apos;t help but wonder a few things. Apparently 60% of this movie was re-filmed by David Zucker because the original movie from Malcolm D. Lee just didn&apos;t work. Considering how awful this theatrical version is, one really has to wonder how much worse the original could have been. The big &quot;draw&quot; to this is that it spoofs other 2013 films like MAMA and it even spoofs EVIL DEAD, which was released a week earlier. The MAMA spoof takes up the majority of the running time and there are simply no funny moments. I sat there in the empty theater just shocked that anyone would want to admit that they were involved in this thing. The jokes were just downright funny with the majority of them being physical stuff but it simply wasn&apos;t funny. The EVIL DEAD stuff got a couple small laughs but certainly not enough to save the picture. Even worse is the BLACK SWAN stuff that just seems to be out-dated and, again, unfunny. Ashley Tisdale and Simon Rex play the main couple but add zero. Katt Williams is really bland in his brief role and even Snoop Dogg and his pot jokes can&apos;t do anything. Oh yes, there&apos;s also the Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan stuff, which gets the film off to a very bad start. I guess Sheen just doesn&apos;t care what it does and Lohan has nothing better to do since she&apos;s now been in two horrid films in 2013. SCARY MOVIE V is without question one of the worst films I&apos;ve ever sat through and trust me when I say I&apos;ve watched some bad stuff. There were several times where I thought about walking out of the screening but I stuck in there to the end so that will show how dumb I was."

      "reviewBody": "There were three medieval/British Isle films released in 1995 -- &quot;Braveheart,&quot; &quot;Rob Roy&quot; and &quot;First Knight.&quot; Mel Gibson&apos;s &quot;Braveheart&quot; is certainly the most epic of the three at three hours, but I found it overrated; which isn&apos;t to say I don&apos;t like it, I just don&apos;t feel that it&apos;s as great as the hype would suggest (only about half of it is worthwhile). I liked &quot;Rob Roy&quot; better than &quot;Braveheart;&quot; it&apos;s very adult-oriented, violent, gritty and grim, however.\n\n&quot;First Knight&quot; is a believable take on the King Arthur/Camelot legend starring Sean Connery as Arthur, Richard Gere as Lancelot and Julia Ormond as Guinevere. They get tangled up in a bit of a love triangle. Ben Cross plays the villain, ex-knight Malagant.\n\nBeing a relatively realistic portrayal of the folkloric story, the tone is similar to &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; (1991), but without the witch and the campy Alan Rickman. So don&apos;t expect any of that silly magical jive with Merlin, Excalibur, etc. This might explain why so many pan the film, but I don&apos;t get their beef. Aren&apos;t there enough cinematic depictions of the Camelot tale with supernatural elements for them to enjoy, like 1981&apos;s &quot;Excalibur&quot;? I&apos;ll put it this way, &quot;First Knight&quot; is to the Arthur/Lancelot legend what the film &quot;Troy&quot; (2004) is to the Helen of Troy chronicle, although &quot;First Knight&quot; is less gritty.\n\nThe film caught my fascination right away with the character of Lancelot. He is portrayed as an expert swordsman, drifter, loner and all-around lost soul. The beginning reveals something integral to understanding his character: Lancelot takes on an intimidating dude in a swordfight contest at a village he&apos;s traveling through. After Lancelot prevails, the big guy asks him for advice on how to be as skilled a swordsman. Lancelot tells him that he needs a couple of obvious sword-fighting skills, to which the man confidently replies, &quot;I can do that.&quot; Then Lancelot tells him the last quality he needs: &quot;And you have to not care whether you live or die.&quot;\n\nThis is a powerful scene; Gere plays the character very convincingly (in fact, if you hate Gere, this film might give you a new-found respect for him). This character-defining episode reveals HOW Lancelot is the only one able to prevail against an incredible and decidedly deadly weapons gauntlet later in the story, which is a highlight.\n\nThe rest of the film is just a solid medieval/British Isle adventure with a noble folkloric tone, requisite forest scenes and all. What I mean by &quot;folkloric&quot; can be seen in Lancelot&apos;s heroic rescue of Guinevere in Malagant&apos;s cave fortress, which is pretty implausible. But these are larger-than-life figures, right?\n\n&quot;First Knight&quot; more than satisfied my hunger for a medieval/British isles flick and surprised me with the intriguing character of the suicidally-brave Lancelot. If one doesn&apos;t have hang-ups regarding the absence of Merlin, Excalibur and the magical baggage that goes with &apos;em, this is an entertaining and classy heroic film.\n\nOn top of all this, the movie features a fascinating allegorical subtext: King Arthur is God, Camelot is Heaven, Malagant is the fallen Lucifer, his dark, cavernous &apos;castle&apos; is the Underworld, Guinevere represents humanity caught in the epic fight between good (Arthur) and evil (Malagant), and Lancelot represents worldly temptation.\n\nThe film runs 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Wales &amp; England.\n\nGRADE: B",

I&apos;m hooked on his genius.\n\nTo say the film is violent is an understatement but nothing any hardcore thriller/Horror fan hasn&apos;t seen before. This film delivers the violence, however, with a purpose and is almost just given the narrative. Zahler turns the protagonist into an antihero. With superb zeal.\n\nI am a fan of Vince Vaughn and this film is a testament to his terrific range and ability as a great American actor. In fact, I think it&apos;s his finest performance to date. In the spirit of not divulging any spoilers, I will just give potential viewers my opinion of the film as a whole.\n\nSupporting cast of Don Johnson, Udo Kier and Jennifer Carpenter are outstanding! Direction was phenomenal as it guides the viewer through the story line with such ease, in a hard to tell plot.\n\nNothing is gratuitous or overdone. It&apos;s simply a great story with simple plot, done in a purposeful way. For a film with 132 mins.runtime it goes very quickly. A testament to a great movie.\n\nI have become a huge fans of S. Craig Zahler and can&apos;t wait to see his next film. \n\nFans of violent Thrillera told in a relevant way with great dialog, do not miss this film!!\n\nOnce again..,Bravo Vince Vaughn for a spectacular performance! It&apos;s hard to believe, after seeing this film, he spent most of his career in comedic roles.",

COPYCAT (1995) is well-produced and gripping, with some interesting quirks of character. Sigourney Weaver gives a nice performance here, but Holly Hunter really defines the show as uncoppish cop M.J. Monahan. Many people will not like her performance for the very reasons that I do like it--Imagine Sarah Palin in the role of a homicide detective, and you&apos;ll see what I mean. Harry Connick, JR, is also memorable in his bad-guy role here.\n\nCOPYCAT has an interesting premise, but, as horrible as the following may sound, it would have been nice if they&apos;d taken it a bit further, having the killer imitate a few others before the big come-uppance. A little more on Peter Foley, who/why he is, and what motivates him would also have helped. COPYCAT is quite watchable if you&apos;re a fan of this genre, but the whole storyline is kind of TV-Land same ol&apos;, predictable, and nothing terribly original despite the winning premise.",

So, if you want to see this movie, do it, but you won&apos;t love it.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the cleverest adaptations of a classic fable since &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (Jekyll &amp; Hyde). Here in &quot;Beastly&quot; we have an adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; set in contemporary New York and revolving around the image-obsessed youth of a fashionable High School in the trendy urban district. I know, right? Awesome premise. The execution may not be quite as awesome, but ultimately I think it&apos;s a great flick to watch when you&apos;re in the mood for a creative morality play.\n\nWhat makes it work is the depiction of the &quot;Beast&quot;. I won&apos;t ruin it for you (if the movie posters haven&apos;t already), but here, unlike other tellings of the tale which portray the Beast as a majestic animal, we get a Beast who is not only &quot;ugly&quot; in terms of scars and bad skin, but more importantly he is made to look like an outcast. He doesn&apos;t look like a literal beast/monster, but instead he looks very human but the kind of human who would make you cross the street to avoid.\n\nIn that respect it turns the microscope on ourselves because we the audience are repulsed without any justification. I thought this was a fantastic starting point.\n\nThe rest of the film may feel sort of like a predictable teen romance, without much tension or or peril, but it keeps our attention and gives us thoughts which we can apply directly to our lives, unlike typical enchanted fairytales which we approach as pure fantasy.\n\nBeyond the predictable, there&apos;s one character who really livened things up and I wish there were more of him: &quot;Will&quot; played by Neil Patrick Harris (yes! Doogie Howser M.D.). Will plays the role of the Beast&apos;s sarcastic, wisecracking teacher. This gives the story an element of humor and wisdom at the same time, as Will is sort of the Beast&apos;s &quot;Mr. Miagi&quot;.\n\n&quot;Beastly&quot; is mostly family-friendly (PG-13 due to some violence and a bit of crude language, though I don&apos;t remember hearing any outright profanity). So don&apos;t expect a harsh, gritty drama. This film is definitely on the lighter side. Movies I would compare this to include: Penelope (2006) starring Christina Ricci as a girl with a pig snout, or maybe something like Practical Magic (1998) starring Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock as two witches looking for love in a small town. If you like breezy supernatural romances, definitely check this out.",

The cast and plot of this movie is just great. You have a bunch of misfits and old-timers who come together and bring the Cleveland Indians out of many years of a slump, and finally contend for an American League Pennant. The movie has plenty of funny moments and mishaps that the characters do just to make you laugh while at the same moment you cheer for the team in each game of the season. Charlie Sheen is great he was perfectly cast as the pitcher. Plus the cast of Wesley Snipes, James Gammon, Dennis Haysbert, Corbin Bernsen, and Tom Berenger all worked very good together even Bob Uecker is a joy as the Indians very funny play-by-play announcer. Major League is just one of those movies when you watch it each time you enjoy it and you just love to cheer for the underdog. If you are a baseball fan and love a little comedy mixed with winning then Major League is a movie to watch many times.",

But there are also scenes where they should have been added into the editing room. The film was excellent in the beginning, slows to a crawl in the middle, and picks up in the end. If it stayed like the beginning, this film would have been flawless.\n\nAfter a 11-year-old kid and his brother witnessed a suicide, the kid hires an attorney to help protect him and his family from threatening mafia members and a stubborn Federal District attorney.\n\nThe acting is very good in this film. Susan Sarandon seemed like she was born to play this role. She was just perfect! For a kid who never acted before, Brad Renfro was brilliant as the snobby 11-year-old.\n\nOverall, this is a slightly above-average crime thriller. Sarandon steals the show as her role of the attorney. Joel Schumacher directed a masterpiece compared to the Batman films he would take over after this film. I rate this film 8/10.",

Hence the rather brilliant Chloe, whose prime accomplishment lies in its being less showy and pretentious than the director&apos;s previous foray into erotic secrets, the ambitious Where the Truth Lies.\n\nSet in Egoyan&apos;s home town of Toronto, Chloe tells the story of the eponymous call girl (Amanda Seyfried) who is hired by gynecologist Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore) when the latter starts to suspect her husband (Liam Neeson) is having an affair. Chloe&apos;s job is to casually approach him and see if he falls for her charm, thus indicating his propensity for adultery. However, as the girl&apos;s reports get more and more graphic, Catherine realizes she has put herself in an awkward position, one that it will be difficult to get out of.\n\nA fascinating hybrid between psychological drama and erotic thriller (there&apos;s a vague hint of Fatal Attraction throughout the movie), Chloe is a rarity due to its attempt to analyze sex and its consequences without necessarily resorting to openly titillating imagery (a characteristic Egoyan shares with another Canadian maestro, David Cronenberg). The only downside of this approach is the same flaw that was much more evident in Where the Truth Lies, namely a deliberately slow pace that affects the thriller aspects but enhances the emotional poignancy, something that comes off as a paradox given the seemingly cold subject matter.\n\nFurthermore, there is no coldness to be found in the carefully crafted performances: Neeson and Moore play the troubled couple with conviction, especially when things start getting more complicated (Moore&apos;s suspicious wife is a tour de force turn that should have received some award recognition), but the heart of the film lies, quite predictably, in Seyfried&apos;s hands, and she rises to the challenge by proving that she can do Big Love-style quality work on the big screen, embodying a complex, intriguing character light years away from her roles in Mamma Mia! and Mean Girls.\n\nOverall, Chloe is a very good movie: sexy without being gratuitous, psychological without getting pompous and, like its title character, delightfully surprising.",

The 1930s scenes are dramatically created.  I found myself trying to guess the plot twists, but with little success as they unfolded.  It was a good film, and richer in substance than the Matrix, and left you with a thought provoking afterthought about our own existence. Going into a movie, I hope to have avoided any prior information about the plot, and this one was well worth the purchase of the video.  This could have made a great 3 hour movie to really develop the characters and the philosophical issues, however, it was reduced down to the 100 minutes time-span.  I&apos;d give it 8 out of 10."

      "reviewBody": "The Woman King (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught in theatres last night. The storyline follows an African kingdom with a new(er) king in 1823 who posses the only female army in Africa. The leader of the female Army has a past that haunts her but the respect of her king, enough to be on his council. She strongly urges him to avoid the slave trade and find alternative methods of riches. Meanwhile, those who do believe strongly in the slave trade look to march on the kingdom and bring them down. A new recruitment class to the female army brings brashness, new ideas to defend the kingdom, and the female leader&apos;s ghosts back to the forefront...\n\nThis movie is directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love &amp; Basketball) and stars Viola Davis (The Help), Thuso Mbedu (The Underground Railroad), Lashana Lynch (No Time to Die), Sheila Atim (Doctor Strange: In the Mouth of Madness), John Boyega (Star Wars: Episode VII-IV) and Jimmy Odukoya (Mamba&apos;s Diamond).\n\nThis movie has so much depth and contains a great primary plot and even better sub plots. The writing is remarkable, thorough and very impressive. The character&apos;s inner demons are well portrayed as is their struggle to overcome them. The acting is out of this world across the board. You feel for every character; and if anything happens to anyone, you feel personally hurt. The villains were also excellent as is the outcome of each of them. The settings and cinematography is outstanding and there is impressive use of lighting. The action scenes are remarkable and the fight choreography is award winning caliber. My only complaint is an awkward love story that is obviously in here to show maturity and self discovery but I could have done without it.\n\nOverall, this movie has literally everything you&apos;d want in a movie - tremendous action, great villains, self discovery and character triumph. I would strongly, strongly recommend seeing this movie and score it a 10/10. We loved it.",

      "reviewBody": "This is from someone who has seen FAMILY STONE THREE times!\n\nBut BEFORE diving in.....FIRST: Let us FOCUS on the Title&apos;s Content and Context:\n\nThe Previews of The Family Stone seemed to hold out the promise of a genuinely light and thoroughly amusing comedy, perhaps a bit over-the-top, but focused on the cultural differences between a very liberal family, (giving the impression that the parents were, perhaps, &quot;Hippies&quot; back in the 60&apos;s) and a super-conservative and tightly wound woman, engaged to one of their sons.\n\nThe problem is that the film showcased in the theatrical trailer plus the marketing campaign launched to promote it, vs. The actual movie you see in the theater have absolutely nothing in common! Unfortunately, previews sole raison d&apos;etre apparently is to get people into the theater. It doesn&apos;t seem to matter in the least to these people if the expectation generated by the short is totally out of sync with the experience given by the film.\n\nThusly, it is easy to understand the plethora of reviewers who were livid with these bait and switch tactics! At its core, Family Stone is much more of a serious film that attempts to underscore the importance of cohesive family life, and how family unity can overcome obstacles that initially seem insurmountable, such as sharing and then getting over the pain of the loss of one of their own.\n\nThe cast is remarkable. Sarah Jessica Parker, Luke Wilson, Dermot Mulroney, Claire Danes, Diane Keaton, Rachel McAdams and Craig T. Nelson. Almost all of them renowned actors, who conform a superb ensemble cast. If you enjoy family dramas with a healthy dose of comic relief, Family Stone is far and away better than most films of its kind...\n\n8******** STARS.... ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!\n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!",

      "reviewBody": "This is not the film to see if you&apos;re looking for a feel-good Hollywood anesthetic to cope with the end of the holiday season. If, however, you wish to experience a great film, then I highly recommend *A Simple Plan*. Its disturbing twist on the American dream may be too difficult for some--especially the very dark ending--but that is part of what makes the film such quality fare. Scott B. Smith&apos;s screenplay is tight and flawless. Sam Raimi&apos;s inspired direction may finally reveal to the rest of the film industry what fans of the Evil Dead trilogy have known for years: that, though his tongue is often firmly in his cheek, Raimi is a fine and grossly underrated filmmaker. Especially impressive is the way he and cinematographer Alar Kivilo approach the snow-covered landscapes. There is an immensity to the frozen wastelands of the film&apos;s crucial scenes that is almost worthy of David Lean. Also commendable is Raimi&apos;s skillful use of animals (among them crows and foxes) for symbolic purposes.\n\nBut the cast, not to be outdone by their crew, is equally notable. Billy Bob Thornton gives his best performance to date, surpassing even his award-winning role in *Sling Blade*. Bill Paxton is phenomenal as a straight-laced-family-man- turned sociopath, and Bridget Fonda&apos;s convincing portrayal of Paxton&apos;s determined wife complements him well.\n\nAudiences at the screening I saw were commenting on the film&apos;s similarities to *Fargo* as they exited the theater, and seemed to belittle *A Simple Plan* for its lack of &quot;originality.&quot; Granted, *A Simple Plan* is not entirely original. There are indeed vague shadows of *Fargo*, as well as *Macbeth* and Robert Frost, among others. But there is no such thing as an entirely original work, as great art is made by standing on the shoulders of giants. Make no mistake, this is NOT a cheap replay of *Fargo*. The differences are too numerous to note here, but suffice it to say that *A Simple Plan* is a great work in its own right, and deserves to be appreciated as such.",

If you want that and that only, then just go watch Transporter I, II and III.\n\nIf you want to see something different and refreshing, then simply don&apos;t miss this one. The story is good, there is plenty of action, and developed characters.\n\nWith a closed mind, expecting to see yet another copy of Jason&apos;s previous work, you&apos;ll be disappointed. But with an open mind, you will enjoy watching this very much.\n\nThis change of plan is simply the best thing Jason has done yet. He&apos;s convincing and manages to create quite some depth in his character. AND he still kicks ass. I can&apos;t see another actor having pulled this mixture of action, drama and psychology off better then Jason. He actually played a convincing &apos;human being&apos; that has to take a hit like everyone, and he did it very well.\n\nAmongst the better action/drama flicks of 2013.\n\n8/10",

      "reviewBody": "This prequel has no business being as good as it is. The first Ouija film came out in 2014 and quickly faded away into obscurity. So imagine my surprise when they decide to make a &apos;prequel&apos; of all things. I hunch is that The Conjuring films have been pretty successful and they are set in the 70&apos;s, when things were a little creepier, no cell phones and genuine scary aesthetic. Imagine my surprise again when up and coming horror filmmakers Mike Flanagan was the man behind the camera. The underrated mirror horror flick Oculus and deaf home invasion flick Hush were two of his recent outings. Things were looking not too bad for this flick and to top it off, it received some pretty decent reviews. \n\nAlice and her two daughters run a scam business in which they &quot;speak to the dead&quot;. The mother justifies this business by telling her youngest daughter, Doris, that it helps people move on and get closure. When her eldest, Lina, plays the new Ouija boardgames at a friends house, she tells her mother to incorporate it into her act. She does and things take a sinister turn when they scam becomes reality. \n\nIt&apos;s hard to make a game board scary. The first film tried, failed and this one tries and succeeds for the most part. Any non-horror fan might balk at the idea that this film is good, but I consider this movie to be one of the most underrated flicks of the year. Flanagan knows how to build solid tension and he doesn&apos;t rely on cheap scares or an obscene amount of gore. This film has none of that. Careful framework and lighting is all he needs to create an unsettling atmosphere. Whenever someone decides to look through the ouija glass piece, you feel yourself tense up expecting something to happen. \n\nKids in horror films are the go to for anything scary. Most movies tend to cast children horribly and they end of ruining the film. Doris, played by Lulu Wilson delivers an innocent and somewhat chilling performance as the youngest daughter. Her goodbye message to a young boy about what it feels like to be strangled to death is an excellent scene to send chills down your spine. No scary images, sounds or blood needed. Just a child delivering one monologue about suffocating you. \n\nObviously the film is far from perfect, but it doesn&apos;t cater to the happy ending crowd either. It takes some chances and for the most part, lands them. I was surprised by how much I liked this film, which may be why the rating is higher than what others would tend to give a film like this. Had the first film never existed, this would be a bigger hit.",

Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar) is handled the mission by his superior Kabir Shroff (Jaaved Jaaferi), who though was the star of solving the &apos;93 bombing case but he still regrets some of the choices he made.\n\nSooryavanshi, along with managing his family issues with wife Riya (Katrina Kaif), investigates the missing RDX which, they get a leak about, could be used for multiple bomb blasts in Mumbai. With help from his old colleagues Simmba (Ranveer Singh) &amp; Singham (Ajay Devgn), Sooryavanshi races against the time, hoping to stop the ticking bomb avoiding a lethal disaster.\n\nI expected from this year&apos;s biggest hit movie that it will be successful in giving good comedy and action. But despite being a mass entertainer, the film does not get any kind of entertainment. There was no crispiness in the action scenes. The very important helicopter chase scene&apos;s VFX looks straight out of a low-budget-high-ambitions movie.\n\nThe only good thing about the movie was Singham&apos;s entry.\n\nPostive -\n\nLittle Bit Comedy Singham&apos;s Entry\n\nNegative -\n\nStory Horrible Direction Overacting and lack of acting Poor Vfx.",

I thought the film was great, really cool genre pic that comes across as a nice mixture of Predator/Braveheart/Beowulf, all the while managing to feel quite original on its own. Nice cast, Nice Script, and everything is handled a hell of a lot more intelligently than what you&apos;d expect from a movie which is essentially &apos;Giant Alien Vs Vikings&apos;. Why this is only getting such a limited release is beyond me, I think it could actually do quite well if given the chance. Basically anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi Action/Adventure done well should be looking forward to checking this one out when and if they get the chance.",

The competition plays dirty while he wants to stay an honest man. \n\nAbel&apos;s moral struggle is what the narrative revolves around. Jessica Chastain play Anna, Abel&apos;s wife and business partner. She is equally as powerful, assertive and dominant as he is, if not more so.\n\nThe director did a wonderful job at creating a tense, sad and dramatic mood throughout. The cinematography is wonderful, the subtle moody soundtrack plays a big part in creating a feeling of impending doom throughout the entire movie, and I am very impressed by the recreation of a 1981 New York. It&apos;s very immersive.\n\nWhile nothing mainstream audiences will drool over, I find &quot;A Most Violent Year&quot; an excellent drama. If you like this movie, you should give &quot;The Two Faces Of January&quot; a chance as well. Not only you would notice what a chameleon Oscar Isaac is, but you might enjoy the classic mood and character-driven vibe of that film as well.",

Jamie Lee Curtis' performance and the film's innovative approach receive praise. However, Michael Myers' reduced role and the divisive new character Corey Cunningham spark disappointment. Concerns about pacing, character development, and the conclusion are prevalent, with some feeling the movie doesn't satisfactorily end the saga.

So much potential was wasted and im not even going to mention the plot or any details. Halloween Ends is an insult to the characters, the ideas and the franchise. It borders offensive. While Halloween Kills has redeeming values Ends just screws it all to high heaven. The final insult is that Michael Myers has been reduced to a couple cameos in his own film. Watch it on a streaming service or somewhere else for free and give it a try just for nostalgias sake but you have been warned.

Although the movie started a bit slow, after about half an hour, things began to pick up and the movie never looked back.\n\nOng-Bak is about a small town villager named Ting (Tony Jaa), who sets out to find the head of his beloved sacred statue, which was stolen. Ting finds his long lost cousin from the village, Humlae (Perttary Wongkamlao), who at first claims to not know Ting until he sees that his village did not send him alone, but with a bag of cash to use as he sees necessary to get the statue head back. This is our first real look at Tony Jaa&apos;s talents, as the first chase scene begins after Humlae takes off with the bag on his motorcycle. Amazingly, Ting follows Humlae all the way to a pit fighter type of place where the real action begins.\n\nAlthough the plot is pretty thin, it is more than made up for by Jaa&apos;s entertaining and seemingly impossible stunts. The movie plays up the stunts big, as it claims no stunt-men, no wires, no CGI, etc. With all that in mind, this movie is pretty mind boggling. Comparisons to Jackie Chan are going to be inevitable, and not undeserving. I can only imagine what the two of them could have accomplished if they did a movie together while Chan was younger. Simply amazing. 8/10"

If you can forgive the lack of &apos;Die Hard&apos; action and replace it with gore, brain matter being splattered everywhere and a good feel factor ending, this is a great watch during lockdown. Bruce&apos;s character is likeable and believable. The storyline (ignoring the original Charles Bronson movie) is plausible and as mentioned, enough gore and satisfying &apos;punisher&apos; style payback to keep fans happy. There was no cringy old man exertion and silly fights. Just a man being a vigilante. Nicely made and a decent pace with the right amount of action and a few smiles and puns on the way\n\nWell done Bruce, this was your kind of movie. A kind of die hard for a 65 year old ex action hero.",

This is a lightweight comedy/drama/love story with elements that we&apos;ve seen plenty of times before, but as I said I thought Gervais made all the difference, and it&apos;s his picture entirely. Had the part been played by Adam Sandler, Jim Carey, or some other over-exposed celebrity, it wouldn&apos;t have been as effective. Greg Kinnear is really an afterthought here as a dead man who keeps appealing to Gervais to help break up the inevitable wedding of his widow (Tea Leoni). *** out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "Almost flawless, this new release improves on the style and genre in a significant way. The film is presented in a way that the viewer can appreciate it from several perspectives without heavily relying on the genre&apos;s standard formulas. We don&apos;t have to wade through the typical love triangle, the maniacal drug lord contracting a hit, or the beloved school&apos;s instructor being tortured and murdered before the ultimate revenge takes place. This film has a legitimate story line, skillfully presented in a clear and well edited manner.\n\nAlthough the film was generally concerned with the development of a specific fighting style and philosophy, the audience is also treated to some authenticity of the then Chinese culture and the biography of a Chinese martial arts master. These features seem to give the production a much higher level of credibility than the average martial arts action movie.\n\nAlthough we did experience some speed editing in fight scenes, it was done in such a way that it enhanced, rather than detracted, from the believability of the film. In &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot;, for example, the ballet and acrobatic like choreography of some of the fight scenes tended to undermine, rather than enhance. If there was any flaw in the fight scenes present, it was minor. This flaw may have been inescapable because of the inherent limitations of the style of the film itself. For example, trivial features such as disconnected striking combinations at the expense of speed editing, or the fact that the Japanese martial artist did not seem to be using a typical Japanese style of fighting. (It appeared to be a combination of Chinese and Korean oriented styles).\n\nThis film should, by all rights, reset the bar for the standards of martial arts films from now on. It was simply an outstanding film in every way.",

      "reviewBody": "Few film auteurs can match the consistency of Michael Haneke, and once again the Austrian filmmaker has come up trumps with an exquisite and brooding mediation on repression, tradition and the sins of the father. \n\nShot in stunning black and white, the film chronicles a series of mysterious events in a town leading up to the outbreak of WWI. The pace is slow and thoughtful, and the film is reference to August Sander while being a respectful throwback to the German expressionists whose work would come out of the horrors the film&apos;s narrative seems to foreshadow. \n\nThe hallmarks of Haneke&apos;s body of work are all there – elegiac tone, clinical editing, wincingly frank dialogue – but in many ways The White Ribbon stands alone in the canon. It is a challenging work that will polarise audiences but represents a breathtaking new wave not just in the director&apos;s career but in European cinema. \n\nSome might say the film&apos;s inherent flaw is that there is no-one to root for, but this is perhaps its key strength. It&apos;s certainly plausible that this is Haneke&apos;s intention: he wants to position us as mute outsiders to a slowly creeping menace, unable to have a say in the invisible horrors that await us. The result is a deadening and thoroughly rewarding experience - a combination few filmmakers could hope to achieve.",

      "reviewBody": "Since The Proposition was unleashed on audiences back in 2005, Aussie filmmaker John Hillcoat has made a name for himself as an uncompromising and ambitious auteur, bringing together A-list casts for bleak and uneasy thrillers. His latest Hollywood effort – following The Road and Lawless – dives into the grubby underground of Atlanta, where corrupt cops, ruthless bank robbers and Russian mobsters are often one and the same. A nice world this ain&apos;t. There&apos;s an unrelenting grimness to this noir-ish street saga that generates the desired mood, and the high level of dread permeating throughout proceedings maintains tension despite a predictably death-happy final act. Yet Hillcoat struggles to fully wrangle Matt Cook&apos;s twisty-turny screenplay; what could&apos;ve been an intriguing web of lies, double-crosses and daring crimes becomes a less believable concoction of coincidences, plot contrivances and dubious character choices. Taking a leaflet out of Michael Mann&apos;s book of realistic action, the handful of set pieces are executed with flair, precision and unwavering violence, with an extended gun fight at the halfway point harking back to Mann&apos;s own Heat (albeit without topping it). Unfortunately the film is also let down by its vast array of players. Other than Casey Affleck&apos;s honest but worn-down cop, everyone else is evil and unpleasant to varying degrees – and rarely more than a caricature – making it hard to care about their fates. Hillcoat&apos;s menacing tone and visual ferocity ensure a certain level of interest and entertainment, but narrative and character weaknesses stop Triple 9 from being essential viewing.",

Although we don&apos;t necessarily see him much (only briefly near the end and for a quick few seconds), it&apos;s his voice which strengthens the performance.\n\nQuestionable scenes are regarding Rusty are how well he knew the friends. How he knew the roommate and was able to kidnap her. How he was able to pick back up the radio device and put it in their trunk. Nothing was exactly explained in the end.\n\nPaul Walker and Steve Zahn bring in solid performance showing a fun level of chemistry.\n\nOverall Joy Ride is a solid early 2000&apos;s teen/young adult type mystery thriller type.

I wanted a light-hearted evening to smile and the movie delivered the experience and exceeded my expectations. If you have a sense of humor, like to laugh at crazy and stupid situations, you will have a blast.\n\nWill this win an Oscar? Not a chance,but will this deliver you 1.5 hours of good time? You bet!",

They don&apos;t miss a chance to make jokes subtle or broad, and they don&apos;t take it easy on anyone.\n\nSongs in the credits are just as funny as songs through the body of the movie, so make sure to wait around for those rather than switching off after the story itself fades to black.\n\nA personal favorite of mine are the scenes where Dewey discovers new drugs. Although I&apos;ve never taken drugs, even smoked marijuana, these scenes were just too funny to be offensive, especially the first discussion of the weed just named.\n\nBe in the mood to watch a comedy, especially for a parody of this type. If you can&apos;t really pay attention, you won&apos;t get everything, and will just think the movie crude. Also, if you&apos;re really stuck up about what&apos;s in your comedy, then you may not like this movie.\n\nIf you&apos;re up for it, you&apos;ll die laughing."

I know he is often said to be &quot;overacting&quot; but his portrayal of this character and the pain and sacrifices he went through really swept me up into an emotional state. There may be times when you are in the mood for a story about someone without the modern &quot;I,Me,Mine&quot; attitude, about someone who knows that the real meaning of love often carries with it the need for making sacrifices and may mean caring more about the other person&apos;s needs than your own.",

This is so obvious that it essentially ruins the whole movie.\n\nThe rest of the movie is OK if you ignore that problem. The performances are generally good, and Miko Hughes is excellent as Simon. There is nothing here you haven&apos;t seen a dozen times before, but it&apos;s generally well done.

Anne Parillaud, an actress I&apos;ve always found fascinating, is riveting as the lead character. Jean-Huges Anglade, Tcheky Karyo and Jean Reno provide a very strong supporting cast.\n\nThe characters were believable and it was refreshing to see a no-nonsense approach to a murder story, meaning if someone had to be killed, they were shot quickly with no questions asked. Some of the action scenes are brutal.\n\nParillaud&apos;s character is memorable. She can change appearances, from a hard- nosed hysterical animal to a real lady. It&apos;s also interesting to see Reno in a familiar role as a &quot;cleaner,&quot; a role he made famous four years later in &quot;Leon: The Professional.&quot; \n\nThe DVD provides either easy-to-read subtitles or a well-done dubbed version. If sound is important to you, you&apos;ll hear better stereo with the subtitled version.",

The absence of Lex Luthor and Lois Lane is noted as a significant drawback. Despite these issues, Christopher Reeve's performance, especially as an evil Superman, is praised. The special effects and action sequences, though less impressive than before, are still commended. Overall, the film is seen as a weaker installment but offers some entertainment and a unique take.",

      "reviewBody": "Superman 3 is kind of like a double sided coin. One side being good and the other one being bad. Jekyll and Hyde if you will.\n\nThe plot of Superman 3 is essentially split into 2 parts.\n\nThe 1st part revolves around Superman going back to Smallville for his high school reunion where he catches up with his high school sweetheart Lana Lang. While there he is exposed to Kryptonite only this time instead of it making him weak, it instead turns him evil. All of this stuff is really good and what you would expect from a Superman movie.\n\nOn the other side of the coin however is the B plot which revolves around Richard Pyror who guest stars in this movie as Gus Gorman. A down on his luck computer clerk who gets tangled up with a greedy businessman who wants to get richer by taking over the world with computers.....you see why this part of the movie doesn&apos;t work right?\n\nThe 2nd part of this movie really isn&apos;t that good if you want me to be honest.\n\nI mean I love Richard Pryor but he really isn&apos;t that funny in this movie. Mostly because he has nothing to work with due to the script.\n\nWhich is strange because you can tell just by the opening credits that this movies trying to be more like a comedy (if you can call it that) but none of the jokes really land and just feel really out of place.\n\nThe villains are awful to. Instead of using a Super villain from the comics like Braniac or Parasite, they instead chose to create a original villain called Ross Webster whose essentially just a watered down version of Luthor with little to no substance.\n\nWhich is insane considering how big of a rogue line up Superman has.\n\nLiterally the only other good thing in this movie is the action and speciel effects which are good for their time.\n\nEspecially the junkyard fight with the evil Superman. That scene is amazing and really demonstrates how great Christopher Reeves was as Superman.\n\nAgain all the stuff with Superman and Smallville is great. There everything you want and love from these movies.\n\nIt&apos;s the other half with Richard Pryor and the villains that&apos;s awful and unfortunately brings the movie down.",

We expect Arnold to run into a terrorist compound in the jungle, guns blazing, unlimited explosives, managing to not get hit by gunfire even while standing still in the middle of a field, one-liners running like water...\n\nBut THAT movie was &quot;Commando&quot;.  Remember?\n\nAnyway, in &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; Arnold is actually a vulnerable character. He gets BEAT UP more than he beats up others.  Now, while Arnold fans (myself included) prefer Arnold to be invincible, in this case it works really well.  Not just because it moves the story along, but also because it makes the protagonist more believable.  Ok, sure, Arnold saying &quot;gracias&quot; to some Columbian bus driver is HARDLY believable, but I think you know what I mean.\n\nYou will also find yourself saying &quot;who is the REAL villain here?&quot; on more than one occasion.  Sure, terrorists kill.  That&apos;s what they do.  But why do you THINK they became terrorists to begin with?  &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; touches on the subject briefly - enough to humanize the terrorist leader, even!\n\nMost of the reviews I&apos;ve read here have been negative...  But those same reviewers were probably Arnold-philes who were expecting something along the lines of &quot;Commando 2&quot;.  As it is, personally I really enjoyed &quot;Collateral Damage.&quot;  If not a smart purchase, then it&apos;s definitely a wise rental. Check it out and see for yourself."

Sounds kinda corny, but for me, it touched on some areas. Well, needless to say, we held hands all during the movie and more later.\n\nOkay, so I read up on the reviews before coming to see this movie and they all made it sound like a boring box office flop, BUT reviews can be very deceiving because this was a diamond that was tarnished by viewers who had NO clue what a romantic flick this really is about! So my advice to you is to go and see it with an open mind and heart and let the movie just unveil itself to your heart and mind and see what happens... best wishes!",

In this film at least it makes sense for Arnie to have an accent. There is some good lines and the back and forth between these two is pretty funny sometimes. When Jim Belushi plays a cop he puts on this irreverant &quot;I don&apos;t like the rules but I get things done&quot; style. It is this style combined with Arnold&apos;s &quot;complete objective at all costs&quot; style that makes this film work. The footage that was shot in Red Square is breathtaking, and overall the movie manages to take a basic plot and make it entertaining. On a side note, the holdout gun used by the villian (Ed O&apos;Ross) in the movie is pretty damn cool if you&apos;re into that kind of thing. Bottom Line: This is worth getting, or you can rent it every once and awhile if you can only take Arnold for so long.",

Other characters include Hannah&apos;s hypochondriac ex-husband Mickey (Woody Allen), her current husband Elliot (Michael Caine), Lee&apos;s boyfriend Frederic (Max von Sydow) and Holly&apos;s friend April (Carrie Fisher).\n\nLike I said before, this is not so much a comedy as it is a drama.  The comedy that&apos;s in it fits, and is good, but the drama is better.  Elliot&apos;s secret love for Lee is handled in a romantic way, but their infidelity is still seen as wrong, and you feel their guilt and inner turmoil.  Mickey thinks he has a brain tumor, he finds out he doesn&apos;t and then he feels worse, and starts desperately searching for a purpose to live.  All the other stories are equally dramatic, with comedy fittingly sprinkled in places too.\n\nThe acting is quite good, everyone playing their part perfectly, whether it&apos;s big or small.  The film&apos;s best performances come from Allen (in what&apos;s no doubt his best performance) and Dianne Wiest as the extremely under-confident youngest sister.  Allen and Wiest don&apos;t necessarily carry the film, as there&apos;s no need to, but their segments were certainly the best, for me at least.  The rest of the cast put forward too, especially Max von Sydow and Michael Caine in his first (and so far his only deserving) Oscar win.\n\nWoody Allen&apos;s direction is at the top of its form here too, much like &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and his other greats.  The camera work and use of voice overs are excellent.  For instance, there is an intensely dramatic scene where the three sisters have lunch together and for the entire scene the camera rotates around the table, the speaker not always in the frame.  His script is great too, it knows when to be dramatic and when to be funny and when to be both.\n\nOne of Allen&apos;s very best, 8/10."

Crowe clearly sought to make a powerful statement about war (my wife was moved to tears during the battlefield scenes) but did not overdo it at the expense of an engaging plot. We left the cinema with a new insight to the Gallipoli story, that being the cost to the Turkish people.\n\nCrowe was very convincing in his role of the grieving, relentless father. Fantastic support role by Yilmaz Ergodan and, although brief, Ryan Corr was very moving.\n\nDon&apos;t wait for this to come to DVD, it is best appreciated on the big screen.",

      "reviewBody": "It was the early 1960s, the USA and Russia were in a race to amass nuclear weapons. It was to the point that if both of them did a maximum launch at each other it would destroy most of the world as we knew it. In truth they wanted to bury each other.\n\nIn October 1962 I was a senior in high school and that is the month of an event that came to be called the Cuban missile crisis. Russia decided to move nuclear missiles to Cuba, just a few miles off the coast of the USA. There was nothing favorable about that move. The still new US President JFK had a tough decision, how to confront Russia and get them to reverse their plans. As history witnessed Russia backed off.\n\nThat is a central theme in the story here, based on real people and real events. An English businessman was convinced to expand his business dealings to Russia, there he would befriend a Russian who would pass him photographic microfilm. He became the courier. A main topic were the plans to place the missiles in Cuba. This spy work was what tipped England and the USA off to the Russian plans and allowed them to monitor the situation which eventually resulted in the confrontation to get Russian ships to turn back.\n\nThis is a very good movie, well-acted and well-told. My wife and watched it streaming on Amazon.\n\nEdit July 2023: Watching it again, it is such a well-made and well-acted movie you can watch it every year or two and still enjoy it as much as the first time."

It plays as some cross between the &quot;Poseidon Adventure&quot; and an Irwin Allen disaster film, with an uplifting musical score.  You know pretty quickly who&apos;s going to live and die, and even though Latura is a mere mortal, only he can save those lives.\n\nStill, &quot;Daylight&quot; makes a good diversion, and the &quot;good guy really is a good guy&quot; concept works for the most part."

However, it is a charming, fun and entertaining family movie. I myself am mortified at the 5.1 IMDb rating. I seriously don&apos;t think it is as bad as all that. It isn&apos;t perfect, but it has a sense of fun. The cinematography is lush and very beautifully handled, and the direction was secure. Charles Grodin is an enormously talented actor, and I enjoyed his performance here, and Dean Jones seems to be having fun too. The child actors are appealing, and the music is lovely. I think the real star is Beethoven himself, whoever trained that dog should be told he/she did a wonderful job. With Beethoven, the film is fun, charming and very entertaining. And there are many memorable moments here. All in all, a very pleasant family film, I recommend it. It is not perfect, but it is one of the better family films out there. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

In classic Scorsese style, the themes of masculinity, subcultural underground interaction, and fast paced film editing combine to form the frenetic basis of Frank&apos;s neo-noir lifestyle. The film is dark, urban, and also blackly comic, relying on strong masculine characters to provide energy and humor.\n\n Overall, Bringing Out the Dead appears to be heavily influenced by film noir. Frank, the protagonist, is at the end of his rope in a rather solitary and stressful job and he often finds escape from the ghosts of his failures through alcohol. Patricia Arquette plays Mary, the femme fatale character and woman in distress Frank seeks to save. The film is uber-urban, set mainly in the nighttime ghettos and hustling districts of New York City, and the major events center around various city dwellers. Frank&apos;s adventures in life saving are highlighted by the colorful characters of City life, including prostitutes, drug addicts, homeless persons, insane persons, goth-punk death rockers and the ubiquitous &apos;Mr. O.,&apos; the smelliest destitute to plague Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy Hospital. Frank is led by Mary into the narcotic underworld, and meets the proprietor of &apos;The Oasis,&apos; a charismatic dealer with a passion for tropical fish and silk robes.\n\nMany of the lighting techniques also serve to emphasize the urbanality of the surroundings, often combining music and fast paced editing. The darkness of the City night is contrasted with the searing halogen of the hospital, and the sunlight that creeps through the window at dawn mocks Frank&apos;s insomnia. Indeed, the movie ends at dawn, with Frank nodding off to sleep. This is very similar to the traditional horror movie ending at dawn when the nighttime monsters are relegated to their nocturnal lairs. Editing techniques are feverish and accelerate in pace as the movie progresses and Frank&apos;s hysteria mounts. Many of these sequences involve a montage of the flashing ambulance lights, 360-degree camera rotation, blurred traffic lights and shots of the crazed driver behind the wheel. My personal favorite scene is when Frank is going to answer a call, and the montage is set to R.E.M.&apos;s What&apos;s the Frequency Kenneth.\n\nOverall, most of the main characters are the male ambulance drivers/EMTs. These characters, Frank, Tom, Marcus and Larry, exude a kind of unquestioned masculinity, which they prove through various means such as violence, excessive flirting, and alcohol consumption. Tom is a violent, hair trigger macho who enjoys pummeling transients and minorities. Marcus is a smooth talking black man who chain smokes stogies and praises Jesus. Larry is an overweight everyman, wanting to start his own paramedic business. Frank is a Marlboro smoking altruistic cowboy with a drinking problem and insomnia. At some point, most of the characters engage in drinking (liquor) while on duty or at least in the ambulance. The characters names are also quite masculine, especially in contrast to Noel, a man who is a drug addict of ethnic descent that is never arguably fully a man.\n\nInherently, Scorsese&apos;s New York City is an urban jungle that will break any man who is not strong or tough enough."

      "reviewBody": "The found footage horror genre feels like a train that should have left the station a long time ago but sticks around waiting to see who else they can cram on board so they can squeeze a couple more bucks out of. Well, I&apos;m glad that train stuck around to let &quot;Creep&quot; in, proving the genre isn&apos;t quite out of steam yet.\n\nIt&apos;s not so much the found footage aspect that makes &quot;Creep&quot; successful but the creative infusion of the mumblecore genre that breathes some life and/or scary death into the film. &quot;Creep&quot; is a two-hander that is co-written and co-acted by Patrick Brice (who also serves as director) and mumblecore king Mark Duplass. Brice and Duplass are able to funnel the mumblecore&apos;s priority of character development and use of a more natural dialogue, or in this case, a very naturally unnerving dialogue, into the staples of a Jason Blum (Paranormal Activity) produced horror film. The combination of these three&apos;s efforts make for one, well, creepy film. \n\nBrice plays Aaron, a normal guy looking to make a little extra cash when he answers a craigslist ad that will pay him $1,000 for a days work to videotape a day in the life of Josef, played by Duplass. The shoot has Aaron driving to Josef&apos;s family cabin at a remote mountain town where instantly both we the audience and Aaron feel things aren&apos;t right. Josef greets Aaron with a loud sneaky surprise hello, and then, foregoing a handshake, straight to a stranger hug. That last sentence pretty much captures the film experience as you go back and forth from shocking jump scares and very unsettling interactions between the vulnerable Aaron and the assertively goofy Josef.\n\nKudos to Mark Duplass for creating a character that is thoroughly terrifying but relatable enough and more importantly sympathetic enough to believably keep Aaron in a situation that just gets weirder and dangerously weirder. Scenes that include a naked bathing Josef giving a mimed bath to his unborn son, which he calls &quot;tubby time&quot;, will long stay in my memory banks under the title &apos;frightening&apos;. &quot;Creep&quot; excels by shifting gears from hilarious, to sad, to scary, to sometimes all of that at the same time. And to each their own, in the SXSW Q &amp; A after the screening Duplass said it was great to watch as some of the audience would laugh at one part but others in the audience would wince in terror.\n\nWhile Duplass and Brice heaped praises on horror guru Blum, saying they helped them achieve effectiveness in a genre they&apos;ve never attempted, I still had my qualms. The jump scares become all too repetitive hitting a mathematical equation that Duplass said Blum taught them. &quot;One jump scare every 10 minutes to keep them in the mood.&quot; Another one of my horror pet peeves is when the holder of the hand held camera in a found footage film only see&apos;s what the lense sees. So when in an open room and the camera moves left so does the character&apos;s vision which results to something surprising them by jumping out to us on screen when all that character has to do is move their own head back and forth to keep informed on what&apos;s around them (thanks for letting me rant).\n\nThe end which I won&apos;t get into has a few moments of &apos;you should have called the cops so much sooner&apos;, but that can&apos;t take away from intense ominous vibe that permeates. I dug &quot;Creep&quot;, it&apos;s a film that is greatly helped by a very good actor who taps into his inner creep and gets under your skin.\n\n&quot;This&quot; gets under your skin.\n\n1 Timothy 4:1",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t think that Al Pacino is a bad actor. I know he can act and he can do it well. Maybe he was just annoyed with the quality of the script. Or maybe he needed a quick buck. I have no idea what happened in this film, but the results were dreadful.\n\nLet me start with the plot: typical race thriller. Personally involved strong character (usually a cop) is on the clock to solve some problem or else. No one helps him, sometimes they even stand in his way, while he battles the odds. In this particular version the hero is personally involved, but does not show it, the people around him try to help, but they are either completely incompetent or pushed away by the very person they are trying to help or (most of the time) Pacino&apos;s character doesn&apos;t even tell them he is in need of help. As for the time limit, it is an arbitrary time limit that he can completely ignore if he really wants to. And as for the strength of the thrill... I guessed the killer in the first 10 minutes of the film. And not just by looking at the cast or reading magical runes. It was blatantly obvious.\n\nThen the acting. Everyone acts sub standard, but Al Pacino is the worse. He doesn&apos;t seem to care a bit about anything in the movie. He is supposed to be a rational FBI profiler that puts logic before his feelings, but he comes out as slightly bored by the badly written intricacies of the plot.\n\nSo, shame on people that use clichés and aging famous actors to win some easy money, but even more shame to people that can&apos;t even get a cliché right. Watch some movies first, then make others. Gee!",

The trailers made it out to be a much more non-stop, action thriller than it really was, showing the last 20 minutes. The majority of the film centers around paranoia. It is true though that the plot twist can be seen coming from a mile away, but how it is delivered is where it succeeds. While I personally wasn&apos;t surprised, how the twist was presented was quite original and chill-inducing. I&apos;ll leave it at that. Where this film really succeeds is in the cinematography and acting, both of which are superb. The locale is beautiful, all the colors are vibrantly displayed and everything looks crisp. There are some scenes with intriguing camera work that works well to add intensity and be intuitive. All the actors really give it their best and create believable characters. Milla was good as usual, but Zahn really surprised me. I never really gave him credit for how good of an actor he is until about now. Overall, it&apos;s worth the watch and is ultimately very entertaining with wonderful characters.",

The film is more funny than scary and there is plenty of nice dialogue and moments in there to keep you entertained. 7,5 / 10 freaky fun movie.",

Homage to classic horror and Hollywood is appreciated, though some find it lacks tension and originality. Supporting cast performances are varied, with standouts and forgettables noted. Cinematography and soundtrack are strengths, but pacing and climax are often criticized. Fans of the series find it enjoyable, while others feel it falls short, making 'MaXXXine' a divisive entry.",

However, as a mysterious killer stalks the starlets of Los Angeles, a trail of blood threatens to reveal her sinister past.\n\nMaxxine is a film that really emphasizes style but falls short in the substance department. While I appreciated the throwbacks to slasher and horror films of the 80s, the plot and execution felt a bit disjointed and lacked coherence. Despite this, the film&apos;s unique style ultimately triumphs over its shortcomings. Mia Goth once again delivers an enigmatic performance, though her character felt less compelling compared to the previous instalments in the trilogy.\n\nThe third act was somewhat disappointing as it didn&apos;t live up to the intense buildup. As a fan of the genre, I found elements to enjoy, but I couldn&apos;t help feeling let down by the less-than-epic finale, especially after the thrilling conclusions of the previous two films.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. There are so many things that go unspoken about parenting, and first time writer-director Maggie Gyllenhaal specifically focuses her lens on the pressures of motherhood, by adapting the 2006 novel from the anonymous and talented and mysterious Italian writer Elena Ferrante. Of course, we are all aware of Ms. Gyllenhaal&apos;s fine work as an actor, yet it&apos;s almost beyond belief that this is her debut as a feature film director. The source material is strong, but Ms. Gyllenhaal, along with a terrific performance from Olivia Colman (Oscar winner, THE FAVOURITE, 2018), turn a coastline vacation into a mesmerizing psychological case study.\n\nMs. Colman proves yet again what a fine and versatile actor she is. Here she plays Leda, a divorced professor on solo holiday on a picturesque Greek island, staying in a refurbished lighthouse tended by longtime caretaker Lyle (Ed Harris). Leda is packing a satchel full of books and academia work, and is a bit perturbed when her isolated beach time is suddenly interrupted by a large and noisy family of vacationers from Queens. Being an observant loner, Leda eyes young mother Nina (Dakota Johnson) who is struggling with her daughter, as well as her husband and other family members. This triggers memories in Leda that are handled via flashbacks with a terrific Jessie Buckley (I&apos;M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS, 2020) as young Leda, stressed out wife and mother to two daughters. She longs for her own space.\n\nAt face value, this appears to be a movie about a woman annoyed that she can&apos;t just enjoy a quiet holiday on the sandy beach as she reads her books. However, there are so many layers to the story and to Leda, that as viewers, we must remain on high alert to pick up all the queues and subtleties. Watching Nina with her daughter and husband sends Leda deep into her past ... a past that still haunts her to this day. At the same time, while gazing at Leda, Nina can&apos;t help but wonder if she is looking at her own future self.\n\nMuch of what we see (past and present) reinforces the isolation and frustration felt by so many mothers. It has nothing to do with loving one&apos;s kids, but rather maintaining one&apos;s sanity and self-being. There are a few key moments, including one that creates tension between Leda and the vacationing family, and another that immediately connects the two. Leda&apos;s past includes steps that would be considered taboo for any wife and mother, and the symmetry of her past and Nina&apos;s present are striking.\n\nPeter Sarsgaard (director Gyllenhaal&apos;s real life husband) has a supporting role in the flashbacks, while Dagmara Dominczyk plays a critical role as Callie, part of Nina&apos;s large family. Bonus points are won with a Leonard Cohen reference (that may or may not be true), and also playing key roles here are a missing doll (connecting Leda&apos;s past and present) and the proper way to peel an orange. Cinematographer Helene Louvart works wonders balancing the beautiful setting with the not-always-beautiful actions of the characters. Especially potent here is the performance of Olivia Colman, who proves she can play most any role. It&apos;s also remarkable what first time director Maggie Gyllenhaal has accomplished here. This is a multi-layered, nuanced look at how relentless parenting can often feel overwhelming and may even lead to feelings of guilt later in life. It&apos;s rare to see such a raw look at the emotions behind what is often referred to as the joy of motherhood. The film leaves little doubt that the always-dependable actor Maggie Gyllenhaal is now one of the most interesting new filmmakers on the scene.\n\nIn select theaters on December 17, 2021 and on Netflix beginning December 31, 2021.",

      "reviewBody": "When I rewatched the original Coming To America this week, I was struck by its timelessness - every scene still worked, every laugh line still felt quotable/funny. In 1988, it somehow managed to be both a classic fairytale and something that felt remarkably fresh (All Black cast?! Actors playing multiple characters?!). This movie meanwhile is...fine? I could not help but enjoy seeing the actors and their characters again, but that&apos;s not a movie. That&apos;s a reunion special. So we wound up with 2 different things happening: an updated version of the first film starring Jermaine Fowler and a bunch of cameos from the original. It is entertaining in fits and starts. But it is not timeless. It is not even cohesive. I have probably watched Coming To America 20 times, but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll watch this one more than twice.",

Jason Bateman is such an under rated actor but can just about do anything, probably hurt by Arrested Development although I must admit I did like that show. If you liked movies like Crash you should enjoy this. 3 stories going on at the same time which also have some intermingling, if there is such a word.

Jeff Daniels is fantastic in it and John Goodman steals the show as an exterminator who is in way over his head. Julian Sands is also great.\n\nIt&apos;s about super deadly killer spiders who kill a researcher in South America then hitch a ride in his casket back to the United States where they begin a killing spree.\n\nThis movie is very funny and also has a lot of great scares in it. If spiders make you feel icky and or shiver then this is the movie for you. The use of real non-CGI spiders and good practical effects make the spiders much more menacing.",

      "reviewBody": "Johnny Mnemonic could have been a wonderful movie, had William Gibson not strayed so far from his original story when writing the screenplay.  Having painter Robert Longo direct the movie, the first and to this date only full length feature he has directed, was probably not the best idea either. While Longo may present the occasional intriguing image, his inexperience shows in other areas.  The acting is terrible for the most part, with Henry Rollins taking the cake for worst performance.  Reeves, contrary to popular opinion, is alright and has a few great scenes, most notably his angry breakdown on the pile of garbage under the bridge.\n\nHaving read Johnny Mnemonic several times the character of Jane is one of the most annoying factors of the movie.  In the story the character is Molly Millions, a confident, tough as nails mercenary who sports several augmentations, most important being retractable blades under her fingernails.  However, they had to change the character since Molly Millions is also a main character in Gibson&apos;s book Neuromancer, and another company owed the film production rights for that book, including the character of Molly.  But they could have made Jane more like Molly. Instead, she&apos;s as insecure as Johnny, and he spends more time protecting her than she does him, which is supposed to be her job.\n\nThere are other little inaccuracies in the movie, such as the Magnetic Dog Sisters.  In the story they are the door guards at the club and Johnny claims that they are &quot;bad news in a tussle.&quot;  In the movie they are Ralfi&apos;s bodyguards and portrayed as pathetic and outdated rather than dangerous. The story doesn&apos;t have anything about NAS, that&apos;s all a fabrication to fill space for the movie.   \n\nGibson seems to try to shoehorn several of his concepts into the Johnny Mnemonic movie.  Instead of living in the rafters high above the streets, as they do in the story, the Lo Teks live on an old bridge.  Gibson has people living on the Golden Gate Bridge in his books Virtual Light and All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties.  The bartender Hooky,  at the club where Johnny meets Ralfi, is an approximation of Ratz, a bartender from the book Neuromancer. Johnny never accesses the matrix (the internet) in the story, but he does in the movie, for no apparent reason other than allowing director Longo to show off some CGI special effects.\n\nLongo also chooses to mimic Blade Runner in the opening scenes, and later on one character tells another that it&apos;s &quot;time to die&quot;, a famous line from BR. I thought this was unnecessary, and cheapens the movie, as blatantly ripping of Blade Runner, whether it&apos;s for the purpose of homage or not, is the signature of several B-Movies, which is sadly what Johnny Mnemonic ends up being anyway.\n\nI still like the movie.  It does have some good elements to it, and if you&apos;re a fan of Gibson, you should see it.  It&apos;s better than Abel Ferrera&apos;s terrible adaptation of New Rose Hotel, because it at least portrays Gibsons technological world.  I hope that Johnny Mnemonic is remade one day because it is a great story. I&apos;d ask Reeves to play Johnny again, because I like him in the role. Gibson&apos;s writing is so descriptive, that a screenplay should follow the story as literally as possible.  Ideally, I think that Johnny Mnemonic would work out as a short film, something no longer than an hour. It is a short story after all, and adding filler to extend the time certainly didn&apos;t work the first time."

      "reviewBody": "Tom Hanks had to pull out all the stops prevent that wonderfully funny slobbering French mastiff from stealing the entire film Turner&amp;Hooch. After all the two were equally top billed and should have had an equal share of the laughs.\n\nTurner&amp;Hooch has Hanks as small town police detective Scott Turner who is moving to an unnamed big city because he wants more challenging police work. But he gets himself an unsolved homicide in the last week on his job. The victim is John McIntire in what was his farewell performance as an old man who lived on a shack at the docks of the small coastal town. McIntire had been complaining about strange goings on at a nearby fish cannery and when someone is murdered there McIntire is also silenced.\n\nThe only witness is McIntire&apos;s dog Hooch and Hanks saves him from being put down as he&apos;s the closest thing to a witness he has. But this dog who lived in that waterfront shack where McIntire didn&apos;t exactly house break him proves to be quite a handful.\n\nThere&apos;s no way you couldn&apos;t love that big goofy dog. But I sure wouldn&apos;t want him for mine. There&apos;s a reason I&apos;m a cat person. Hanks who&apos;s a pretty funny guy himself has some wonderful scenes with the dog. But he proves to be quite the chick magnet as well because of the interest veterinarian Mare Winningham shows in Hanks.\n\nThis one scored big at the box office in 1989. It still a very funny and heart warming film for audiences of all ages.",

Interestingly, I guess Stephen Lang and the creators knew there was no rational way they&apos;d be able to match the setup of the original. Instead they&apos;ve gone for an old-school 90s type action thriller with little to do with the first film besides a vague backstory for the villain turned avenging angel. It&apos;s a Taken-Blind Fury mashup with a bigger budget which allows it some pretty cool set pieces and photography. This combined with the cheesy dialogue, eye-gouging, bone snapping, and just general &apos;why has no one called the police, and how could anyone survive that?&apos;, makes a bad film atleast fun to watch.",

The soundtrack is awesome and it introduced me to electronic music. I never liked it until I saw &quot;Hackers&quot;. I love the clothes and the visuals. I knew it wasn&apos;t accurate from the minute I saw it, but then again, it&apos;s not like it was posing itself as some movie that depicted the real life of cyberpunks. It&apos;s just fun little movie. Though some of the dialogue is a bit cheesed up, it is quotable.\n\nI especially enjoyed the performance by Matthew Lillard. It made me look forward to seeing him in &quot;Scream&quot; later on. He is so funny. I enjoyed Angelina Jolie, though this is hardly one of her best performances.\n\nThe only person who really didn&apos;t belong in this movie was Lorraine Bracco. She just looked strange in her role. Other than that, this movie was a good movie and it shouldn&apos;t be bashed because it depicts people, technology, and life inaccurately. What movie ever does?

Kaitlyn Dever is really good with a warmth makes her sudden relationship feel genuine.\n\nOl Parker&apos;s direction is also really good, the location constantly looks gorgeous and it maintains a solid pace throughout.

      "name": "Cate Blanchett Displays Her Own &quot;Gifts&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "In a small town deep in the South, a single mother endowed with a special ability becomes involved with the disappearance of a young woman and has a brush with the supernatural, in `The Gift,&apos; directed by Sam Raimi.  Cate Blanchett stars as Annie Wilson, a young widow attempting to raise her three kids and provide a decent life for her family, scraping out a living on Social Security since the tragic death of her husband in a work related accident the previous year.  She supplements her meager income by doing `readings&apos; for the local townsfolk, accepting their donations for the insights she offers them into their own lives.  Annie has a `gift,&apos; the ability to see certain things in the cards that enables her to advise her clients about personal issues.  It&apos;s something she can&apos;t explain; she knows only that it&apos;s inherited (which she learned from her grandmother), and that it&apos;s real.  And though it&apos;s helped her maintain her home, she soon finds that it doesn&apos;t always make for the most pleasant of situations, as when she must advise a young woman, Valerie Barksdale (Hilary Swank), on how to cope with her abusive husband, Donnie (Keanu Reeves), or attempt to help a troubled young man, Buddy Cole (Giovanni Ribisi) come to terms with some sensitive aspects of his life.  Then, when a client comes to her to ask for help when his daughter disappears, not only does it take her to the dark side of the human experience, she discovers that certain individuals, including local sheriff Pearl Johnson (J.K. Simmons) do not believe that her `gift&apos; is real.\n\nStylistically crafted and delivered, Raimi&apos;s film will keep you engrossed and on the edge of your seat until the very end.  He successfully blends reality with just a touch of the supernatural that makes for riveting suspense while keeping it within the realm of believability.  The relationship played out between Donnie and Valerie is anything but unique-- you&apos;ve seen this before, many times in many films-- but within the context of this story it&apos;s fresh and it works.  The doubtful sheriff and the cynical, jaded defense attorney, Gerald Weems (Michael Jeter), are fairly stereotypical, but that can be easily overlooked in light of the overall story and especially due to the credibility of the Annie character, which is well developed and never presented as anything beyond what can be readily accepted as true to life.  As the central character, Annie anchors the film and enables the circumstances in which she is involved to be perceived as real; it&apos;s the strength of the film, and it&apos;s what makes it all work so well.\n\nWhat also makes it work is the strong performance by Cate Blanchett, who makes Annie so real and accessible, displaying her `gift&apos; with restraint and avoiding the possible pitfall of taking it too far over the edge, which could easily have made it suspect.  Instead, she brings a depth to the character that draws you into her world and allows you to empathize with her, which would have been impossible had she invested Annie with even a touch of the charlatan.  With consummate skill, Blanchett creates a well rounded character which demonstrates that as an actor, she definitely has a very real `gift&apos; of her own.\n\nRibisi also does a memorable turn as Buddy, with a striking performance in which he creates some disturbing moments that are almost painful to watch; his is a character study of a soul in distress, seeking solace and resolution, and even as he attempts to sort out his life, you are able to sympathize with his plight as you share Buddy&apos;s experiences.  And it&apos;s through Buddy (as well as Annie, of course), that the audience is able to make that necessary and very real connection with the film.  With films like `Saving Private Ryan&apos; and now this one, Ribisi is on his way to establishing himself as one of the premiere character actors in the business today.\n\nPlaying somewhat against type, Reeves proves that he can be a good `bad&apos; guy, giving possibly one of his best performances ever as Donnie.  He very credibly conveys that sense of explosiveness lying just beneath the surface that makes his character menacing and dark, which in turn makes Donnie psychologically as well as physically threatening.  It&apos;s a good job by Reeves, who deserves credit for taking on a role that is so disagreeable and insensitive.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Greg Kinnear (Wayne), Katie Holmes (Jessica), Kim Dickens (Linda), Gary Cole (David) and Rosemary Harris (Annie&apos;s Granny). A taut thriller that is emotionally involving, `The Gift&apos; delivers what it promises early on, which is exceptional, as many films of this nature often fail to actually follow through after a tremendous opening act.  Rest assured, this one does and has it all; suspense, credibility and some memorable moments, all courtesy of Raimi, a good story and a superb cast. And that&apos;s the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is, simply put, the best film I have seen all year.\n\nChan-wook Park&apos;s mastery of cinematic language is stunning. I Recently saw Oldboy, and was intrigued by the style and freshness of that film. but where Oldboy sometimes degenerates (albeit in a very entertaining fashion) into simple violence and visceral satisfaction, Mr. Vengeance does not.\n\nThose not accustomed to a slower paced film may say that there is too much postulation and ambiguity in this film, but they would be completely wrong. Never has a film managed to capture my attention so fully as this one. The majority of the time, we are left in quiet reflection of the events hat have taken place. The setting is rich and South Korea is shown in all its glory as a culture emerging from a somewhat torn past.\n\nEvery moment is beautifully framed and executed, and there are multiple ways in which the viewer is drawn into the lives of the characters that exist in this space. Colour is obviously very important to park, as each moment is perfectly balanced and flows from frame to frame in a way that would make most Hollywood directors green with envy.\n\nThe themes of vengeance and tragic fate are intertwined in such a way that almost numbs the senses after a time. Even though there is no &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;villian&quot; in this film, each character shares the spotlight in turn and the motivations for their actions are slowly revealed, justified, and then torn apart as fate intervenes to bring everything to a point of complete helplessness and futility.\n\nA very powerful, beautiful film.",

This means, she&apos;s forced to do anything anyone commands her to do. Delightful fable has all the old-fashioned ingredients from the storybook (evil uncle, wicked stepsisters, etc.), but lively pop-songs, goofy humor, and a nice nod to the Grimm Brothers give it a hip kick, though the fantasy effects look only half-hearted at best. Headed by a wonderful cast, Hathaway is an utter joy. Pleasant family fare will take adults back to their youth and kids will live happily ever after. Based on the Gail Carson Levine book. Running Time: 96 minutes and rated PG for mild violence. ***"

      "reviewBody": "As the depression era kicks in, Americans were grasping for any sort of inspiration they could get, enter equine supreme, Seabiscuit. Considered broken down, too small and untrainable, Seabiscuit went on to become a bastion of great racehorses and in the process bringing solace to those closest to it.\n\nBack in 2003 upon its initial release, critics were very divided as to the merits of Seabiscuit as a picture. Some were concerned that this adaptation from Laura Hillenbrand&apos;s highly thought of novel missed too many crucial elements, others were merely touting the tired old charge of the film purely baiting Oscar (something that is levelled at every film in history about hope and second chances), the more astute critics of the time however lauded it as the delightful and inspiring piece that it is.\n\nIt would be churlish of me to not agree that Seabiscuit is laced with sentiment, rookie director Gary Ross barely wastes a chance to tug the heart strings and paint an evocative sequence, but if you have got it in you to accept this true story for its base emotional point, then it is one hell of a wonderful experience. Seabiscuit is not just about the equine beauty of the picture, it&apos;s also a fusion of three men&apos;s personal wavering, who for one reason or another need the horse for far more important crutches than those provided by financial gain, make no bones about it, Seabiscuit is a very human drama. Knowing how the picture will end never once becomes a problem, because the historical accuracy in the story makes one yearn for that grandiose ending, one to gladden the heart in the way it must have done to thousands upon thousands of Americans back in the depression era day.\n\nRoss wisely chooses to filter in as much realism as he possibly can, archive stills and narration serve as exceptional points of worth to the narrative structure. Then there is the first rate cast to fully form the emotional complexities that Seabiscuit provides. Jeff Bridges, Tobey Maguire (waif like), Chris Cooper, Elizabeth Banks, top American jockey Gary Stevens and a splendidly jaunty William H Macy, all can rightly feel proud of their respective work on this picture. Yet it&apos;s with the thundering race sequences that Seabiscuit really triumphs best, magnificent beasts hurtling around the race track are excellently handled by Ross and his cinematographer, John Schwartzman, whilst a nod of approval must go to the sound department&apos;s efforts, for this is definitely one to give your sub-woofer a work out.\n\nSeabiscuit was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning none, perhaps the Academy also felt like those critics who thought it was trying too hard for a Golden Statue? But now after the dust has settled some years later, it pays to revisit Seabiscuit and judge it on its own emotional terms, for it&apos;s a tremendously well crafted picture that is of course as inspirational as it most assuredly is tender, a fine fine picture indeed. 9/10",

I found his performance/homage to Terry Thomas &quot;rather good&quot;. The various cameos and supporting performances were also &quot;rather good&quot; The film is soaked in British humour and I can see how some from the &quot;colonies&quot; just don&apos;t get it but for people to give this 1 or 2 out of 10 is beyond belief.",

      "reviewBody": "Korean thriller makers are making a splendid job now-a-days, they have even succeeded the Hollywood thriller makers in this specific genre..The Man from Nowhere&apos; is a perfect example of this. Anyone might think this is a mix of &apos;Leon:The Professional&apos; and &apos;Man on Fire&apos; where a highly trained but troubled person tries to protect a child, but this movie is more than that.There are many short but strong stories nicely fabricated that will keep You watching the total movie in a rush! Now come to the story. A mystery man with no past links suddenly becomes involved in a drug transport because of a child being kidnapped and unfortunately that child was the only link of him to the outerworld .So had to comeout from his own hideout and save the girl and find out the persons behind it. He has to defy the police as they are after it too, at a point the sad past life comes to daylight and it was well understood about his strange behavior of everything. This rouge so renegades the force and takes the action by his own. The stylish BOURNE looking action scenes specially needs to be appreciated.But I m not giving it the highest rating only its lacking of showing the touchy emotions in the best way..it was excess .Silence play a better role than words in some situations, it needed that. But the overall movie was simply sublime.reasonable violence was shown here..it was logical. Some funny characters and parts are nicely putted into, that enhanced the color and variety of the movie. But I am getting addicted to this korean thrillers.&quot; Memories of a murder&apos;, &quot;Joint security Area&apos;, Vengeance trilogy( including OLDBOY), Infernal Affairs trilogy, &apos;The Chaser&apos;,&apos;Thirst&apos;,&apos;The Bittersweetness of Life&apos;, &apos;I Saw The Devil&apos;..the serial is getting longer and longer..keep it up !!",

      "reviewBody": "Fictional movie based on a real unsolved Hollywood murder in the 1940s. The mutilated body of Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirschner) is found in an empty lot. Officer Dwight Bleichert (Josh Harnett) and Sgt. Leland Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) are assigned to the case. Blanchard becomes obsessed with the case causing troubles with his girlfriend Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson). She then falls for Bleichert. Then there are more murders and lesbians and incest are thrown in... \n\nThe plot is a little too convoluted but so was the book (by Jack Ellroy). To be totally honest I can&apos;t understand why this is getting blasted by the critics. It&apos;s no masterpiece but it&apos;s 100 times better than director Brian DePalma&apos;s last film (2002&apos;s terrible &quot;Femme Fatale&quot;) and probably his best work since 1996&apos;s &quot;Mission Impossible&quot;. The 1940s setting is beautifully captured with clothes and settings--this film really looks great. DePalma once again gives us some incredible visual sequences--one murder is downright terrifying and one of the best things he&apos;s done in years. Also the plot, while involved, does reach a logical, satisfying conclusion. However the film isn&apos;t perfect.\n\nThere&apos;s a lesbian bar here that&apos;s really overdone. It&apos;s beautiful, with a ridiculously elaborate stage show--but in 1940s Hollywood? I don&apos;t think so. The acting is all over the place. Eckhart OVERACTS to a ridiculous degree. Hartnett is terrible (no surprise there) but so are Johansson and Hilary Swank (both wonderful actresses). It seems like Harnett&apos;s presence bring them down to his level of non acting. Last, and least, is English actress Fiona Lewis who is certainly acting but not in this picture. She overdoes it so much she makes Eckhart look restrained. \n\nSo I DID like it but with a tighter story and a better leading man this might have been great. As it stands it&apos;s a very good, well-made movie with some questionable acting. I give it a 7.",

There isn&apos;t much to say about this movie, in fact is not boring and the performances of Dempsey and Monaghan meet the required level to make tolerable they as a couple, but the film falls into a number of same places that we watched in other movies thats why Made of honor lost among so many films of the genre and at the end of it nothing new provides.\n\nNeither idea is the most original or the jokes the most successful, in fact the plot falls on an abuse of sexual humor that at times results unnecessary and it only is used to start a laughter of a story that had no where to find the funny. In fact the film is the perfect movie to spend a Sunday at home with a popcorn&apos;s bag and let the brain rest from the pressures of the week. The film is simple, from start to finish, and that is his greatest success because it doesn&apos;t pretend to be what it isn&apos;t. It&apos;s only entertainment.",

      "name": "&quot;21 and Over&quot; - OK Rating. A Hang Over+Jackass+American Pie Combo",
      "reviewBody": "Watched &quot;21 and Over&quot; last night at an advanced screening so sharing a review for those wondering about it.\n\nIf you should use other films/media to describe &quot;21 and Over&quot;, it is like a combination of &quot;Hang Over&quot;, &quot;American Pie&quot;, and &quot;Jackass&quot;. If describing in one sentence, &quot;21 and Over&quot; is stupid drunkenness or drunk galore? It is an enjoyable film and I would recommend it for those who enjoy dirty slapstick humor and just college craziness. I wouldn&apos;t feel the need to watch this film again and it isn&apos;t an Oscar nominee type of film, but If you like watching drunk people, this film is for you.\n\nI admit, I like watching this type of films from time to time, but a big reason I was interested in this film was because I liked the writers&apos; Jon Lucas and Scott Moore&apos;s other pieces, the popular &quot;Hang Over&quot; film series and &quot;Change Up&quot;. I did assume that &quot;21 and Over&quot; would be structured and directed just like &quot;Hang Over but &quot;21 and Over&quot; does not have the story-telling abilities that &quot;Hang Over&quot; has nor are the story, plot, resolution, and characters anywhere as interesting. One&apos;s own experiences and perspectives change with age, and Lucas and Moore are out of touch with the current 20s generation as the dialogue, story development, and characters in &quot;21 and Over&quot; are old, clichéd, and stereotypical.\n\nThe movie took a while to pick up the pace. Surprisingly and thankfully Jeff Chang is not the main focus in this film, nothing against the actors (these newcomers did a great job), but the supposed main character burned through his drinking and bar scenes early on in a series of montages.\n\nSome of the likable aspects of this movie are the timing of the stunts and how outrageous the stunts are. When it seemed like the film would end soon or run out of tricks, the characters&apos; rolling ball of chaos just got bigger and bigger. The stunts pulled now a day for slapstick humor are getting more outrageous and openly, visually sexual. If nothing, Lucas and Moore get kudos for fresh stunts. Perhaps they spent the time they were supposed to use for brainstorming dialogue and story development, watching &quot;Jackass&quot; instead.\n\nIn the end this film is still enjoyable because it&apos;s not like this film&apos;s audience watches these kinds of films for the dialogue nor accurate representation of cultural identities. All that matters is that the slapstick stunts and moderate dirtiness of the film is enough to not leave a silent house. For sure, the high school kids during the advanced screening got a kick out of it, hoping their college life can be that fun? Crazy at least.\n\nReview by WendyXS@FeiXiangFilms",

      "reviewBody": "Fan buzz has been very negative for this movie. Myself, I have tried to remain positive. But even I, as a very lenient movie watcher has to admit that this really wasn&apos;t great. It&apos;s not on par with any of the other six movies of the franchise. It wasn&apos;t all bad though, and I will tell you what was good and bad about it now.\n\nThe animation was a real mixed bag. It had great backgrounds that looked almost like they were taken right out of the movies, then you have these very poorly designed characters. As much as I liked most of the designs on everything but the characters themselves, I couldn&apos;t help looking at the animation like a beautiful painting with poo smeared in some spots. You can look at the painting, but it&apos;s hard to enjoy it when you can&apos;t take your eyes off the poo. It takes away from the potentially awesome animation. They look plastic and stiff, and the facial expressions and lip syncing look like something from a Playstation game from 1999. The voice acting was pretty bad as well, although Christopher Lee did and alright job, and Matt Lanter had a lot more emotion in his voice acting than Hayden had in the entire role.\n\nThe dialogue was about as bad as can be. The exchanges between Anakin and his apprentice were all cliché and boring. Not to mention almost all the droids were like copies of Jar Jar Binks. A main problem was that I thought this would focus more on action than it did. That&apos;s why I felt all that lame childish stuff wouldn&apos;t matter. But it was mostly discussing the problems and treaties and stuff, which was the last thing this movie needed. There was a fair bit of action, but even when they were having awesome lightsaber duals, they felt the need to stop every 4 seconds and talk about stuff that I didn&apos;t need to hear, such as why they were having the battle. I wanted to see lightsaber duals on a level that they couldn&apos;t manage in a live action movie, and they did not deliver in this way. A lot of the other action was pretty good though, some being very fast moving and intense.\n\nThe storyline really didn&apos;t consist of much.... just people trying to get Jabba the Hutt on their side, basically. This is not a movie that I think many old Star Wars fans will enjoy, but it may be a movie that helps introduce new people to the franchise, which is always a good thing. This is definitely a movie for the younger audiences, not older people and film critics. It basically just felt like a long TV Show episode, which is basically all it was. It was good for a TV episode, but not for a movie. If the action is as good in the series as it was in the movie (and hopefully there will be more), then I will be looking forward to it. But if they release another movie that looks to be at this level, I will have to wait until DVD.",

      "reviewBody": "Now, I was not going to check this film out. I mean, the trailers weren&apos;t bad, but I felt as if it was just going to be a Poop-Fart Joke filled movie. The Positive Reception that came with the Early Reviews was so surprising that it got me to buy a ticket. I came home a couple hours ago, and it wasn&apos;t groundbreaking or anything, but it was a nice, heartfelt fun time at the movies.\n\nThis movie is cute, action-packed, heartfelt and... emotional. All the characters were fun and likeable, specifically Krypto and Ace, Batman&apos;s Dog. The movie gave Ace a backstory that was very touching and it hits you in the feels, which I was definitely NOT expecting. The animation looks pretty good on the Big Screen, but isn&apos;t anything crazy. I found it WAY better than what I expected. To be fair, yes, it did have Poop, Fart and Pee Jokes, but I think the heartfelt, emotional nature of the movie overshadowed the jokes.\n\nIf you own a Dog, or any Pet and are a DC Fan, I recommend checking the film out because it&apos;s a nice, fun time and a good way to spend an Hour and a half. Enjoyable, fun and heartfelt: I would give DC: League of Super-Pets a 7/10 (For reference, I gave Minions 2 a 6 and Lightyear an 8)",

      "reviewBody": "Dil Chahta Hai Starring: Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Preity Zinta, Sonali Kulkarni, Dimple Kapadia and Ayub Khan Director: Farhan Akhtar Music: Shankar-Eshan-Loy Released. Debutant director Farhan Akhtar&apos;s (son of Javed Akhtar and Honey Irani) Dil Chahta Hai is the story of three friends and their respective thinking of love. It has a new, trendy and youthful look, completely different from the standards norms of the Bollywood film.\n\nAkash (Aamir Khan), Sameer (Saif Ali Khan) and Siddharth aka Sid (Akshaye Khanna), three close friends, have completed their education and are on the threshold of life. Akash does not believe in love. He is a flirt and his love affairs do not last for more than a month. Sameer believes in love. He is always carrying his heart on his palm and falling in love every time. But he still has not found that special girl. Sid, a painter, is the most sensitive and mature among the three. He knows the true meaning of love. He finds love in everything, everywhere and everytime.\n\nAll three are enjoying life. Then comes the twist when Sid falls in love with older woman Tara Jaiswal (Dimple Kapadia), an interior designer, who is a divorcee. Akash is not able to understand the depth of Sid&apos;s love and hurts his sentiments for which Sid slaps Akash, thus creating a rfit between the two friends. Sameer tries to bridge the gap but is unsuccessful.\n\n Sid leaves for a painting workshop at Kaushali. Akash leaves for Australia for his dad&apos;s business. On the flight, he meets Shalini (Preity Zinta), who he had briefly known earlier. Their friendship slowly blossoms into love. Meanwhile Sameer also finds his special girl in Pooja (Sonali Kulkarni), whom he wants to marry. Time has passed. All three friends are again in the same town -- but things are different for them now.\n\nFull marks to director Farhan Akhtar for giving a completely new and fresh look to the film in his debut film. The storyline is different from the run-of-the-mill fares which we are used to seeing for such a long time. Farhan is a welcomed entry in the list of talented and young directors. He has also dared to be different. He has taken care of the minutest details in the film. Technically, the film is no way behind some of the best Hollywood movies.\n\nNow the performances -- all the three leads are fabulous. They all fit their roles to a T. Aamir Khan as expected is the best. He is too good in the comic scenes and is excellent in the emotional scenes also -- especially in the scene when he breaks down on the phone while talking to his father. He definitely is the best among the current lot who does his work with precision and utmost dedication. Saif Ali Khan is a wonderful surprise in this film. This is his career-best role and one cannot imagine anyone else playing Sameer&apos;s role. His sense of timing and facial expressions are very natural and makes Sameer a very adorable character in the film.The least significant role was of Sameer but Saif made it very important. Now comes the final winner -- Akshaye Khanna. An actor-par excellence and very natural in front of the camera, Akshaye has played the role of Sid to perfection. His emotions and expressive face say a lot. He has given a spell-binding performance. Preity looks great in her new look and has acted well. Sonali Kulkarni is wasted and Dimple Kapadia still looks gorgeous and plays her role well.\n\nMusic and the picturisation of the songs flow with the mood of the film. The locales of Sydney and Goa have been brilliantly shot. The first half of the film has some of the light good moments. The second half is filled with emotion though the Aamir-Preity affair has been stretched a lot thus making the film a bit lengthy. But one thing is sure -- Bollywood has got one more talented director in Farhan Akhtar.",

      "reviewBody": "I do not understand why this movie was slagged so badly when it came out. I finally watched it on VHS, and I liked it much better than &quot;Red Planet&quot;, its companion Mars movie.\n\n  Sure, &quot;MTM&quot; steals from lots of other movies, but what film doesn&apos;t?  The opening is lifted directly from &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, but it serves the purpose of setting everything up rather painlessly.  I love the cast, and they do establish a sense of camaraderie here.\n\n  I am not an aeronautical engineer, but I do know enough science to appreciate the way the fight to survive the entry into Mars&apos; atmosphere is based on the limitations of their equipment.  In most action movies, the hero has limitless ammo, fuel, food, etc.  It was truly heartbreaking to see Tim Robbins&apos; character make the choice he did.\n\n  Overall, &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; is very enjoyable.  It felt like a short story lifted directly out of the Sci-Fi of the 60&apos;s, which I grew up reading.  The pacing is very good, the acting is good (given some of the cliched situations), the script does not insult your intelligence, and I liked the resolution very much.  Fun at the movies, what more can you ask?",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;CHILD 44&apos;: Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nA mystery thriller film; starring Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace and Gary Oldman. Hardy plays a security officer, that&apos;s investigating a child murderer, in 1950s (Stalin era) Soviet Union. The film was directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Richard Price; it&apos;s based on the novel, of the same name, by Tom Rob Smith (the first of a trilogy of books). It also costars Joel Kinnaman, Vincent Cassel and Jason Clarke. The movie was a bomb at the box office, and got mostly negative reviews from critics, but I enjoyed it.\n\nLeo Demidov (Hardy) is a former war hero, that now works as an MGB agent, in the 1950s Soviet Union. He&apos;s a strong supporter of Stalin, and his country&apos;s ideals, but when a series of children start turning up dead, his loyalty is put to the test; being that murder is not supposed to exist there (it&apos;s believed to be only a capitalism crime). When his partner&apos;s son is killed, he refuses to go along with the government&apos;s cover-up (of the crime), and he&apos;s exiled; along with his wife (Rapace). Despite their treatment, Leo continues to pursue the killer, and justice. \n\nThe movie is well directed, written and full of great performances; especially Tom Hardy (my favorite male actor). Some people have a problem with the fact that the actors all speak English, in the film, but with Russian accents; that didn&apos;t bother me. I actually like the characters (especially Hardy&apos;s) and the insightful political commentary of those times; I found the movie to be quite involving as well. Maybe one of the main problems, with the film, is that the first cut was 5.5 hours long; and now it&apos;s less than 2.5 hours. It&apos;s a lot of story, and character development, crammed into one movie. The film is actually pretty fast paced too, it just doesn&apos;t quite come together right. I still enjoyed it though.\n\nWatch our movie review show &apos;MOVIE TALK&apos; at: https://youtu.be/5zwAFiaOqq4",

Not a solitary video-game has transferred to the big screen with even a modicum of success. Is money THAT available to make movies, that such an embarrassment as this could reach the point of actual RELEASE? Maybe no video distributor would touch it and they had no choice?\n\nBy far Van Dumb&apos;s worst flick. Playing Colonel William Guile, he leads his commandos against the seriously insane General Bison, dictator and megalomaniac of the fictitious Shadaloo. Filmed on the cheap, up on Australia&apos;s Gold Coast amidst the worst plasticised sets you ever saw. Phony explosions fill the sky, make-up is at the level of Grade 2 face-painting and a script to match. The acting beggars belief, Kylie Minogue&apos;s just about topping the list! This is seriously heavy-duty garbage! Much was made of the &quot;singing budgie&apos;s&quot;  martial arts training for the film. From memory, she gets to perform a total of three high kicks which would be unlikely to cause distress to an elderly pensioner.\n\nAs for Raul Julia as General Bison? It was to be his last screen role, completed just before his death (maybe he saw the rushes?) It is a sad epitaph he would never have wished for. No-one comes out of this mess looking good, not even the paying audience - ESPECIALLY them! In hindsight, the very last scene sums up the cringe-factor..watch it!"

      "reviewBody": "If the Wachowski brothers&apos; Speed Racer was the ultimate tribute to family friendly classic cartoons, Ninja Assassin is the ultimate tribute to 80s martial arts B movies like &quot;Enter the Ninja&quot;, video games like &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; and the Ultra-violent anime genre titles like Ninja Scroll.(Already noticed the name &quot;ninja&quot; in all the titles mentioned? well, what a coincidence!). It is violent, it is bloody and packed to the gills with action. Every thing else ends up playing second fiddle to the fights.\n\nUnfortunately, &quot;every else&quot; also includes the story which is, a hodgepodge of very familiar elements. Raizo (played by Korean star Rain) is an orphan raised by a cruel master Lord Ozunu(played by Sho Kosugi, famous for his starring roles in, what else, 80s ninja movies like &quot;Enter the ninja&quot;.) to be part of a secret clan of ninjas that have been responsible for countless assassinations over the centuries. Through a series of flashbacks (intercut with scenes of a half naked hunky Rain training with some vicious looking weapons), Raizo&apos;s tragic story is fleshed out. We see his tormented childhood days as a ninja trainee; his only emotional refuge, an orphan girl who, like Raizo, is part of the clan. One day, his friend tries to escape from the harsh ninja way of life and is executed, prompting a change of heart in Raizo who eventually betrays his clan after a narrowly botched mission. Now on the run, hunted by both his former comrades and a special international task force, Raizo finds an unlikely ally in the form of Mika Coretti, a Europol agent who is close to exposing the secret existence of the Ninjas and hence targeted for assassination.\n\nSimply put, the unoriginal storyline is highly predictable and filled with B movie clichés from stem to stern. It is a definite step down from the philosophical Matrix trilogy or the sophisticated and political V for Vendetta. \n\nCharacters are, at best, cardboard cut outs and at worse painfully bland. None of them come across as emotionally engaging. Raizo is especially underdeveloped despite being the main character. His internal motives for his betrayal are never fully explored and the cheesy romance bit, not to mention the whole big about &quot;the heart&apos; feels like a tacked-on afterthought. The acting is passable; nothing better than the level of a TV series, but the script manages to have a couple of witty lines of dialog.\n\nThough Ninja Assassin is no work of storytelling perfection, it delivers what it promises: lots of fights and lots of violence. Limbs are lobbed off, stomachs are split open and heads are busted as the movie slashes its way from one fight scene to the next, delivering scenes of wicked weapons and bloody carnage that make even Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre look like a tame PG film. The fight choreography is well executed with a good mix of slow motion and frantic close-ups. Special effects and CGI are used to effectively give the movie a very comic book-like feel (not surprising since the Wachowski brothers are avid comic fans and one of the screenplay writers is also a comic book writer). Thankfully some erratic camera work (especially during the scene where Raizo is being chased through a busy street) does not feel distracting but enhances the frantic and lightning fast pace of the fights. Blood flows like rivers as Raizo proceeds to disembowel enemies en masse; definitely not for the squeamish.\n\nOn a whole, Ninja Assassin feels like a hack-and-slash video game come to life from the first skirmish to the climatic showdown involving modern day special forces taking on an army of ninja warriors . Some cheesy bits here and there require a certain suspension of disbelief but the film&apos;s portrayal of ninjas in general is gritty and realistic yet preserves their mysterious and legendary status. It is refreshing too to see that Raizo is not some invincible killing machine as he does tire and he does take his fair share of hits, even going down a couple of times.\n\nForget Naruto and all those brightly dressed, magic power spewing ninjas of recent anime. Ninja Assassin is the butt-kicking, face slashing answer to all that. A respectable re-imaging of a dated genre and 99 minutes of non-stop violent escapism once you look past its narrative flaws.",

All in all it&apos;s an entertaining movie which ends without epiphany for these characters (like .....). This film has multiple stories but does not try to be alternative and cool. It just wants to work! Sarah Polley (whom I never heard of at the time but follow her work now) was great; Katie Holmes wasn&apos;t quite Katie Holmes - and that was good; Fichtner&apos;s good; but my favorite was Timothy Olyphant who did a kick-ass job of a charasmatic bad-guy (it was hard not to hate him by the end). I&apos;ve read the other comments and these people just take this thing TOO seriously! It&apos;s not the movie of 1999, it&apos;s not &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, it&apos;s just &quot;Go&quot;. I have this movie on DVD and heard Doug Linman&apos;s commentary: he sounds like he had a lot of fun making this. I had a killer time watching this. I guess if I came in with different expectations I would&apos;ve hated it like everyone else on this site!"

      "reviewBody": "Woody Allen&apos;s alter ego, Boris (a bitterly good and sardonic Larry David) makes this statement to the audience rather early on in &quot;Whatever Works&quot;. The truth is, no matter how misanthropic, sarcastic and neurotic Woody Allen is, he ultimately is a pretty likable personality...if you like that type. Allen&apos;s return to Manhattan after three stays in London and a wonderful stop-over in Barcelona is yet another niche film. Fans of Allen, as well as fans of Larry David&apos;s &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; (which not so ironically should be the same folks) will find plenty to laugh at here, while others will inevitability whine, &quot;I don&apos;t care for Woody Allen...and oh, that Larry David! Can&apos;t stand him!&quot; \n\nThe plot of &quot;Whatever Works&quot; is irrelevant. Boris is some sort of genius-level physicist trying to speed his way to death, though those metaphors are never explored as poignantly as they should be. It all just serves as a soap-box for Allen (through David) to funnel his usual dialogues about relationships, love, luck and the meaning of life. It&apos;s all very broad and obvious this time around, but it&apos;s sometimes nice to still be laughing at the same old feel-good shtick. It should come as no surprise that Boris also tells the audience this isn&apos;t a movie designed to make you feel good, unless you&apos;re Allen fans, and then you&apos;ll feel pretty swell afterward. Leave it to Allen to infer moviegoers are inherently morons, but we&apos;re sophisticates for watching his films.\n\nApparently this is a re-worked screenplay from the 1970&apos;s and the &quot;Annie Hall&quot; style monologues to the audience are evidence of that. In the jokes department you&apos;ll find old standards mocking the French and suggesting kids should attend &quot;concentration camps&quot; for the summer mixed with modern humor about the Taliban and Viagra. There&apos;s also one hilarious throw-away/blink-and-you&apos;ll-miss-it reference to James Cameron&apos;s &quot;The Abyss&quot; that makes you wonder if perhaps the screenplay was first reworked in the 1980&apos;s before its final incarnation here. \n\nIn the casting department we find Patricia Clarkson, yet again, is a delight in her curiously under-written over-written role (which is far too simply complex to explain in a traditional review) and continues to build a case for herself to be declared this generation&apos;s &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot; twenty years from now. Evan Rachel Wood is cute-as a-button (oh, as her character might declare, what a cliché) as a Southern cutie-pie who runs away to New York City and meets up with the suicidal Boris. Allen, as always, is luminous with his photography of the &quot;young lady.&quot; And unlike the similarly dumb motor-mouthed funny-voiced Mira Sorvino character from &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot;, Wood&apos;s character is actually given an arc here and proves not to be as shallow and moronic as Boris originally assessed, which indicates maybe Allen is growing just a teeny bit in his view on women...or maybe not.\n\nUltimately this is yet another testament to Allen&apos;s world-view, which is summed up here as do whatever works for you to trick yourself into believing you&apos;re happy in this miserable world. Sure, there are times when Boris&apos; diatribes run a few lines too long, or when the film stops dead when he is not on screen, but for the most part, this is Allen doing what works best for him. No other director can call himself out on all his personal pratfalls and annoying quirks yet still find a way to endear himself to the faithful who are ever patient with him and his films. No other director can be so charmingly mean-spirited and self-deprecating yet still find a way to declare his alter ego a genius at picture&apos;s end. And that&apos;s why we&apos;ve always liked you, Woody, for better and for worse. For what it&apos;s worth, when it comes to Allen&apos;s better and worse, &quot;Whatever Works&quot; falls happily in between and works just fine, thank you very much.",

For me, there were a couple times when I really laughed out loud (and I was sober as a judge), most of the time I simply had a smile on my face as I watched the master make a complete fool of himself - which is what Will Ferrell does. I read some of these in-depth critiques in utter amazement. I mean, really, what were you expecting to see? It is a very light hearted spoof of one of the most ridiculous TV series in history. Generally, I thought it was funny, we&apos;ve been repeating some of the funnier, albeit, totally ridiculous scenes all day. I do strongly caution parents with children. When Will Ferrell says PG-13 he isn&apos;t kidding. Sexual innuendo and drug references are going to be quite uncomfortable for the prudish crowd.",

The characters are vividly real, and there is such a strong sense of situations unfolding in real time that it&apos;s truly mesmerising.  I felt like a fly on the wall, eavesdropping on conversations I could never hear otherwise.  I think many people would absolutely hate this movie, partly because it doesn&apos;t pass judgement on behaviours that are repulsive to the bulk of humanity, and partly because it exposes us to them at all.",

I really loved Lori Cardille here, and I&apos;m surprised she didn&apos;t do much, much more than this.\n\nIt has one of the best openings in horror movie history (and Dr. Tongue is likely the most impressive zombie in any of these films), but it does drag just a little bit in the middle. The antagonists (of which there are more than one), aren&apos;t your typical mustache twirlers, and Romero gave them some depth and nuances that actually made most of their actions completely believable.\n\nThe climax more than makes up for the middle drag, and I love how Romero injected his undead with both horror and humor. A must for not only Romero fans, not only zombie fans, but horror fans in general.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s too bad that because this film is ostensibly about an old lady it must be considered a &quot;smaller&quot; film in Bong&apos;s oeuvre. It&apos;s not. It is every bit as brilliant, and as large, as Memories of Murder, in my opinion.\n\nIn many ways this is the natural, and equal, follow-up to Memories of Murder. It&apos;s every bit the caper film that one was, and, although slightly more somber in tone, the film keeps unraveling in directions you don&apos;t expect making it much more a plot driven movie than a character study. Kim Hye-ja is, however, magnificent as the titular (gawd I hate that word but I&apos;m using it anyway) mother. There is a scene in this film where she tells the family of the victim her son didn&apos;t do it and her eyes are so electrically charged it made me jump back from the screen. Mother fires on all cylinders. The direction, cinematography, script, and acting are all grade A. It&apos;s one of those films where each of the secondary characters steals the show for a brief period. (How &apos;bout that cop who kicks the apple from Won Bin&apos;s mouth?) Bong does a remarkable job of populating the world of this film with real people and manages to give them depth and development in a very short period of time. I confess to having a little trouble tracking the other female characters in the film, but no matter. There is a scene (without spoiling anything here) where Kim Hye-ja asks the other &apos;retarded&apos; kid if he has a mother and it&apos;s one of the most complex and heart-rending scenes in cinematic history. Hyperbole notwithstanding, just freakin&apos; WOW! on that one when you ponder just why she is crying.\n\nI wasn&apos;t sure where Bong was going to end up going as a film maker. Barking Dogs Never Bite was a reasonable debut. Memories of Murder, a masterpiece. But was it a lucky shot? I&apos;m glad I don&apos;t have to consider the dismal Antarctic Journal a Bong film if I don&apos;t want to. The Host was lots-o-fun, but that&apos;s the one that worried me. Maybe he was going to start making blockbuster type films. But now, after recently seeing his contribution to Tokyo!, and now Mother, I have every reason to believe he is going to kick my butt with interesting film for a long time.",

      "reviewBody": "I wasn&apos;t sure about this film and the first ten minutes or so where not very promising, but I persevered as it was shown on BBC Four which has to mean something. Boy was I glad I hung in there. This film gets better and better and in spite of the violence, which was never gratuitous it is one of those films that will stay with me for a very long time. I have never seen a Korean film before but on this evidence it won&apos;t be the last. It&apos;s a refreshing change to see the back streets of Seoul instead of downtown Los Angeles. The cast is good and the star (a likable ex-rogue cop) turns an excellent performance. If you&apos;ve got a strong stomach and get the chance, watch it but put the kids to bed first!",

    "summary": "Reviewers say 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3' is largely disappointing, with a weak plot and lack of originality. The humor is criticized as forced, and horror elements are deemed ineffective. Kartik Aaryan's performance is often noted as underwhelming, with poor comedic timing. Vidya Balan and Madhuri Dixit receive praise, but their roles are underutilized. Technical aspects like cinematography and special effects are subpar. Despite some positive remarks, the film fails to live up to the franchise's legacy.",

      "reviewBody": "November 1, 2024, has brought us two second sequels: Singham 3 and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3. After my disappointment with Singham 3, I was hoping Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 might offer the comic relief and freshness the action flick sorely lacked. Unfortunately, it ended up being just another 2 hours, 38 minutes, 750 rupees, and several brain cells wasted.\n\nThe original Bhool Bhulaiyaa stood out for its clever storytelling, thanks to Priyadarshan&apos;s deft direction and a cast that brought depth to a grounded psychological thriller. It remains iconic not only for its suspense but for its genuine humor and tension.\n\nWhile I wasn&apos;t a fan of the second installment-and Bollywood&apos;s trend of pseudo-sequels rarely impresses-Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 actually makes the second movie look decent in comparison. This third entry is entirely unnecessary, lacking any semblance of genuine acting, humor, or originality.\n\nThe film suffers from a predictable, recycled plot, cringe-worthy performances, and cheap jump scares that are more ear-piercing than frightening. And to top it all off, the ending reveal is, to say the least, absurd-a last-ditch attempt at a twist that falls flat and only adds to the ridiculousness. Not a single moment compels or even amuses; it&apos;s just a tedious rehash of tropes and tired slapstick that never lands.\n\nTo put it simply, this movie shouldn&apos;t have been made. Now that it exists, my only request: please, let&apos;s stop here.",

      "reviewBody": "At first I thought wow, Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston, 2 big names. Might be good. I was a bit disappointed. Aniston&apos;s character is very flat and one-dimensional in the movie - very forgettable. Clive&apos;s acting is convincing, but the plot sucks. The villain (Vincent Cassel) looked pathetic and hardly scary. Even though he commits lots of violent acts in the movie, he really doesn&apos;t inspire fear in me. He actually looked more convincing dressed up as an office colleague of Clive Owen&apos;s in one particular scene, than when he&apos;s dressed as a street thug. Perhaps its because he&apos;s a bit too skinny and his skin is too good, perhaps its because his facial features looking more like a 17th century European aristocrat than some Chicago street thug. I think he&apos;d probably do better acting as a psycho-killer rather than a professional thug.\n\nBy the end of the movie, I was really unimpressed. Yes the plot didn&apos;t really turn out like anyone had suspected, but its more of a &quot;oh right, so what?&quot; feeling I had, rather than a &quot;oh my god. I can&apos;t believe it&quot; feeling. By then I was just waiting, sitting there, hoping that something good - something really good - better come along soon, because I&apos;ve not even gotten excited yet. But it never happened - and I never got excited or scared once throughout the whole movie. \n\nI really wouldn&apos;t pay to watch this at the cinema - it would be like when I watched SWAT at the movies a few years ago. It feels like my money would be better spent elsewhere. Probably okay to watch this at home if you didn&apos;t have to pay like full price to rent this - if this movie was in the bargain bins somewhere in the video store.",

Typical underdog story that I have always been a sucker for and this one is no exception. Has that &quot;Rocky&quot; feel to it with shades of countless other inspirational sports stories from seemingly the beginning of films. It is good at capturing the intensity of Philadelphia sports fans and also excellent at showing how blue collar folks in that part of the country interact, socialize and often struggle to make a living. If nothing else, &quot;Invincible&quot; displays just how imperative and key that professional sports are to many within certain U.S. metropolitan areas. 4 stars out of 5."

I think this movie was aimed in a very great direction and was executed well; however, in areas it seemed to show that it was lacking power of a bigger budget. At other times that is not the case at all, As there are many great visual scenes, and a fantastic conclusion. \n\nI think the acting was very unexpectedly good, not a single person was a bit unbelievable or annoying or anything like that.\n\nThe story is great, and is very much intelligently woven with modern theories and discoveries in science. \n\nThere is one thing I will say in a somewhat negative vein. There are certain kinds of scenes that I wish they did way more of, like outside on the planet. Not that they don&apos;t do it enough, but you can never have enough of that.\n\nI highly recommend this to any sci fi/ space fanatics\n\nIt is one of my favorite movies in the last couple years.\n\nHope you enjoy it.",

      "reviewBody": "As the story of the Collector unfolds, it quickly becomes obvious that writer/director Marcus Dunstan is knowledgeable when it comes to the horror genre and knows what makes people click. \n\nFirst, there is a 70s/80s feel to this movie. From the dirty-ish cinematography to the pacing, editing and the casting choices, a lot of this reminds me of the less polished horror films of these decades. \n\nOne of the aspects where this movie shines is with its protagonist Arkin. A down-on-his- luck handyman struggling to pay his bills. Josh Stewart was a revelation for me in this role. I can&apos;t wait to see what the future has in store for this actor. Is he a one-note actor who was perfectly cast or is this some serious talent? I for one would lean toward the latter. Stewart is perfect in making us feel Arkin is a decent guy with a will of is own but just suffers from a total lack of respect by the people around him. He oozes charisma despite the &quot;loser&quot; role he has to work with and reminds me a little bit of Sean Penn. What makes the film effective is really exploring the character of Arkin early on. There is a simple situation driving this man to do what he is about to do and we can relate to him. \n\nUnfortunately, the movie begins to lose steam when Arkin gets inside the house. At first, the traps and situations are intriguing. But character and story development halts to a crawl. Who is the collector and what is the meaning of this collection? We don&apos;t really know and Dunstan doesn&apos;t seem to care in the least. Themes explored throughout the movies? Again, doesn&apos;t seem very relevant. \n\nAs the story progresses, the traps become the star of the film and the whole thing seems more and more far-fetched. What should be the meat around the bone becomes the entire movie. The concept seems more like the latest horror gimmick. It&apos;s a somewhat interesting and entertaining one but one must deplore all the character development of Arkin if the rest of the movie was really just about mindless fun. \n\nAll in all, this is a solid movie reminiscent of the trashy, dirty 70s and early 80s horror flicks. But it seems to be lacking in themes and symbolism that made those movies so great and I sensed the writing lost its purpose mid-way. I also deplore what I sense like a desperate attempt to build a franchise, as opposed to make a great movie. The movie seems like a setup for sequels, a TV series pilot more than a single work of art to be enjoyed. \n\nThe movie deserves a 5.5 and is relatively well-done. If this review seems harsh, it&apos;s just that the first half hour or so lets you think the movie will be much more powerful than it actually ends up being. \n\nVery curious to see if a sequel will be done for this one.",

      "reviewBody": "Controversial, graphic, violent, unsettling, disturbing, devastating &amp; disgusting but an underrated cinema nonetheless that dares to explore the darkest side of adult industry, there&apos;s no denying that A Serbian Film is destined to upset majority of viewers with its gross, sickening &amp; utterly discomforting subject matter which is exactly its motive but looking beyond its on- screen depiction of every taboo, it&apos;s also a pretty bold piece of filmmaking.\n\nSet in Serbia, the film tells the story of Milos; a well-past-his-prime porn star who&apos;s happily married &amp; has a son but the family is going through financial difficulties. Contacted by one of his former colleagues who has a job offer for him, Milos is introduced to the new director &amp; finally agrees to participate in an &quot;art film&quot; only to discover that he&apos;s been drafted into making a pedophilia &amp; necrophilia themed snuff film.\n\nBrilliantly directed, fairly performed, effectively paced, superbly handling the elements of suspense &amp; featuring many deeply disturbing sequences from start to finish, A Serbian Film is certainly not for the faint-hearted or the easily distressed or even a completely normal human being plus its so-called political allegory is nothing but an excuse to justify the pervertedness depicted here as the only reason why this film exists is to shock the viewers in the name of art.\n\nYet, a story like this needed to surface on the screen not because it has a motive but because it represents a far darker side of world which most people choose to ignore, despite being aware of its existence. On an overall scale, A Serbian Film is an extremely unnerving story about porn industry but is definitely not porn plus it isn&apos;t afraid to jump deep into the abyss &amp; bring everything to the surface, which it manages to do in an unflinching manner.\n\nYes it&apos;s going to leave you emotionally scarred &amp; No, you don&apos;t have to watch it just for the sake of it. Make your mind multiple times before you hit the play button and for those who think they can handle this stuff, just when you&apos;ll be thinking that this sadistic experience is finally over &amp; you&apos;re almost out of this dark tunnel, the final line just before the end credits will do enough damage to break all hell loose. Watch it at your own risk."

That  to me  is the mark of a well-done film  or any work of art, for that matter. \n\nI have never since seen a prodigiously talented performer without wondering what their day-to-day life and relationships must be like.  This film stayed with me despite my revulsion to its &quot;ugliness&quot;  the discomfiture it engenders.\n\nHighly recommended!"
